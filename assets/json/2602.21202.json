            "content": "Online information is increasingly multimodal, including videos, articles with figures or images, podcasts, and interactive web content. It is thus essential that information retrieval systems be able to index over large multimodal collections. However, indexing multimodal content at scale requires an incredible amount of storage,2 limiting the ability of search providers to build truly multimodal indices. While recent advances in multi/omnimodal retrieval [7, 12, 27, 33, 42] have begun to make performance gains, significant progress is still needed to achieve scalable performance in real-world settings. 2Indexing 1 video takes 10MB under multi-vector setting, but it is estimated that YouTube hosts 14 billion videos [37], estimating an index size of 140 Petabytes. Preprint 26, 2026, Qin et al. In this work, we focus on multi-vector late interaction [21], which has shown promise in multimodal domains [12, 13, 38, 42, 50, 55]. Optimizations like ColBERTv2 [44] have improved efficiency through two-stage retrieval pipeline that uses document cluster centroids to avoid scoring every document, enabling sub-linear scaling in collection size. However, the computation and storage cost still grow linearly with document length [43, 53]. This linear scaling presents prohibitive barrier for multimodal corpora, where single multimodal document could easily reach thousands of tokens. Additionally, these thousand token representations are often underutilized in late-interaction, making the indices built from them largely unnecessary in practice (Figure 1). We find that most multimodal late interaction models use only about 1% of their index during full evaluation pass. To address this gap, we propose learning compact, query-agnostic, multi-vector, multimodal document representations under constant vector budget. By bounding the document representation to constant size, we ensure that both index storage and query-time costs remain manageable and fully customizable to storage or compute constraints, while retaining the benefits of fine-grained late interaction. We adapt three strong performing multi-vector compression methods from textual domain to multimodal: (1) Sequence Resizing (SeqResize) [e.g., 35], where full multi-vector document is projected down along the sequence dimension by an MLP; (2) Memory Tokens (MemTok) [e.g., 32, 53], where learnable vectors are appended to the document context and used as the representation; and (3) Hierarchical Pooling (H-Pool) [e.g., 9], which iteratively groups similar vectors and replaces them with their mean. However, these methods are ill-suited for multimodal compression as they struggle to handle redundant and noisy inputs, or suffer from representation collapse. To address these limitations, we introduce novel attention-guided clustering, where learnable universal query tokens are used to guide the attention to select centroids and weight the aggregation for clustering (AGC). We evaluate these methods across four tasks and three modalities: BEIR [48], document retrieval benchmark (text), ViDoRe [36], visual document retrieval benchmark (vision), MSR-VTT [54], video-retrieval benchmark (vision), and MultiVENT 2.0 [23], video-retrieval benchmark (audiovisual). On these benchmarks, we provide an extensive set of experiments and introduce new state-ofthe-art results on ViDoRe and MSR-VTT. We find that AGC is the strongest compression technique in any modality, offering the best performance at learned compression rates and better transferability between sizes than non-parametric compression (H-Pool). Additionally, we find that training with compression objective can improve performance over an uncompressed multi-vector index on ViDoRe and MSR-VTT, highlighting that compression reduces the redundancy and noise of multimodal inputs. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce four methods for index compression in any modality: SeqResize, MemTok, H-Pool, and AGC. (2) AGC presents novel approach, in which learnable universal query tokens select centroids and weight cluster pooling. (3) We present series of experiments demonstrating the strong performance and flexibility of AGC across document, visual document, and video retrieval settings."

            "content": "Multimodal Retrieval. Many works have introduced benchmarks for evaluating representations in information retrieval. In the textonly setting, evaluation suites such as MS MARCO [3] and BEIR [48], have become standard for measuring retrieval effectiveness across diverse domains, tasks, and query types. Video retrieval has been extensively studied using benchmarks that use natural language descriptions to retrieve videos, such as, MSR-VTT [54], VATEX [51], DiDeMo [15], and ActivityNet Captions [22]. More recently, MultiVENT 2.0 [23] has provided large-scale, multilingual benchmark for real world video retrieval. Visual document retrieval has also recently emerged as another challenging multimodal task, requiring strong optical character recognition ability and visual understanding of layout and graphics, e.g., ViDoRe [36] and MMDocIR [10]. Complementary efforts have introduced modality-specific embedding benchmarks, including MTEB for text embeddings [39], MSEB for audio embeddings [14], and MMEB for vision-language embeddings [20]. In this work, we focus on the following settings: text, visual document, video (vision only) and video (audiovisual). We believe this covers the most challenging combinations of modalities and model capabilities. Multi-Vector Index Compression. Multi-vector embeddings offer number of distinct axes by which to compress the index. Naturally, being just collection of vectors, it is amenable to the same quantization [11, 18] and truncation [19, 24] methods as singlevector retrieval. It is also the norm in multi-vector text retrieval to down-project the encoders large hidden dimension to more manageable dimension (e.g. 768 128) [21]. Furthermore, as is the focus of this paper, multi-vector indices can be compressed along the sequence dimension as well in order to end up with fewer tokens. This is generally split between methods that prune tokens according to simple corpus-level or attentional heuristics [1, 61], pool them implicitly via special tokens that aggregate meaning or explicitly via heuristic representation merging [9, 16, 25, 41, 49], or simply project the sequence length into fixed quantity of embeddings [35]. Finally, index methods like PLAID [43, 44] cluster the document token vectors and represent each as its nearest cluster centroid plus low-bit-quantized version of its residual. Attention-based Compression. To address the computational burden of long contexts for language models, prior work explores token compression via KV cache eviction. While query-aware methods effectively prune tokens based on prompt attention [8, 17, 28, 30, 47, 58, 59], they are incompatible with retrieval indexing, which requires document representations to be computed before the query is known. On the query-agnostic side, approaches instead leverage self-attention scores or learnable parameters to determine token importance [5, 6, 41, 56, 60]. However, critical gap remains: these methods optimize for generative tasks by preserving the global \"gist,\" whereas retrieval requires retaining discriminative details needed for distinguishing hard negatives from positive documents."

The mapping 𝜋 represents the full representation generation pipeline which may involve direct encoding, parametric or heuristic compression, or combination of these operations. critical constraint in retrieval is that this mapping must be applied during indexing, where the query 𝑞 remains unknown. Consequently, 𝜋 must compress the document in query-agnostic manner while preserving information likely to be relevant for future queries.

Prior work first used this method in document compression for text retrieval [35]. SeqResize is an intuitive approach, allowing an encoder to fully contextualize all representations in document and then parameterize compression separately (but trained jointly) from the encoder. To perform SeqResize, the tokens of the document R𝑛ℎ are passed into the bidirectional encoder 𝐹enc, which is an 𝐿-layer transformer. Let Z(𝐿) = 𝐹enc (X; 𝜃 ) R𝑛ℎ be the last-layer hidden states. Since 𝑛 varies across documents, we first pad or truncate Z(𝐿) to fixed length 𝑛0: Z(𝐿) = PadTrunc(Z(𝐿), 𝑛0) R𝑛0 ℎ. We then resize along the sequence dimension to produce the compressed multi-vector representation R𝑚ℎ using 2-layer MLP: = (cid:16) 𝜎(cid:0) Z(𝐿)W 1 (cid:1)W (cid:17) , W1 R𝑑 𝑛0, W2 R𝑚𝑑 .

Following these works, we aim to learn memory tokens for any document representation. To perform compression with MemTok, we append set of 𝑚 memory tokens R𝑚ℎ to the document tokens R𝑛ℎ, and feed the concatenated sequence into the encoder 𝐹enc, which is an 𝐿-layer transformer. After bidirectional self-attention, each memory token attends over the entire document, and we discard all non-memory positions. The final states of the 𝑚 memory tokens form the compressed multi-vector representation of the document.

First, parametric methods like SeqResize exhibit modeling failure in which many tokens remain unused during single evaluation pass; consequently, it fails to scale effectively with the token budget (see subsection 6.4). MemTok suffers from information collapse: its architecture inherently smooths over distinct features, impeding the effective utilization of multi-vector representations. (See subsection 6.5). Second, neither SeqResize nor MemTok possesses the necessary heuristics to eliminate redundant information. Audio and visual signals are often semantically empty or redundant, such as silent audio segments, static backgrounds, and unchanged temporal sequences [4, 26]. These methods waste their limited token budgets on encoding repetitive and noisy signals rather than capturing key semantic content. Finally, while H-Pool actively removes redundancy, the reliance on greedy iterative merging makes Multi-Vector Index Compression in Any Modality Preprint 26, 2026, them vulnerable to noisy outliers, like the aforementioned noise in multimodal data.

We enable bidirectional attention and initialize the pretrained weights from Qwen2.5-Omni-3B. We train on combination of the human written queries and synthetically generated queries [45]. We sample frames at most 24 frames and audio at 4KHz. We train for 2 epochs with global batch size of 8 and gradient accumulation step of 4, learning rate of 105, and bfloat16 precision. We cannot build any index over the uncompressed representations, and only utilize FastPlaid for the compressed representations. Evaluation. For each dataset, we report appropriate recall at (R@k) and normalized discounted cumulative gain at (nDCG@k). We also report the percentage of base performance for each compression method calculated as ( compression score ) and report the compression ratio as 1 ( base score budget avg toks per doc )."

Our main finding is that AGC performs the best across the modalities compared to the other compression techniques, maintaining 97% of the uncompressed model performance at nDCG@10. We also find that H-Pool performs well for non-parametric compression, often outperforming the other learned methods SeqResize and MemTok on non-text benchmarks. Across the datasets, we find that the only method able to outperform the base model, which builds full index with one-to-one mapping between document tokens and vectors, is AGC (R@1 on MSR-VTT). This highlights two main takeaways. (1) Training multimodal retrieval methods with compression objective can be beneficial. Multimodal (audio and visual) tokens do not always provide new information to the document representations and are often semantically redundant6, meaning that information density does not scale linearly with document length, an assumption reasonably 6Visual compression has traditionally relied on this trend [4].

Practical results imply that full indices for multimodal collections offer diminishing returns relative to their cost. BEIR. In Table 2, we explore the methods performance for text retrieval on subset of BEIR datasets, reporting both the absolute nDCG@10 and relative performance compared to the uncompressed ColBERT baseline. With budget of 32 tokens, documents in BEIR are compressed by around 80%.7 We find that there is not much difference between MemTok and AGC. Both methods compress the text document representations well and maintain stable performance across the different datasets. Additionally, we find that there is larger gap between H-Pool and the learned methods, as the performance varies more significantly depending on the task. ViDoRe. In Table 3, we break down the performance of each method on the ViDoRe topic splits. Comparing the runs with the same training configurations, we see that AGC and H-Pool significantly outperform SeqResize and MemTok. H-Pool and AGC appear to be relatively equivalent, with their averages only differing by 0.002 in nDCG@5. However, when looking at the breakdown by topic, we see that AGC is more stable across domains than H-Pool. We also compare to another learned compression method, MetaEmbed [53]. We find that AGC and H-Pool have comparable or better performance to MetaEmbed. This highlights the strengths of both AGC and H-Pool, even when training at smaller scales.8 MSR-VTT. In Table 4, we report more detailed comparisons of our baseline and method on MSR-VTT. We find that every compression method sets new state-of-the-art on MSR-VTT over previous multi-vector approaches (ColQwen-Omni, Video-ColBERT) and dense approaches (OmniEmbed), even when compressing the index to only 5 vectors per document. We even see at budgets of 32 and 128, AGC performs better at R@1 than the base model, again 7NFCorpus: 87% (avg 237 toks), FiQA: 76% (avg 134 toks), SciFact: 86% (avg 230 toks), SciDocs: 83% (avg 188 toks), TREC-COVID: 81% (avg 170 toks), Touche: 79% (avg 153 toks), Arguana: 82% (avg 177 toks) 8We note that the comparison to MetaEmbed is not 1-to-1 because we are only capable of training at 20 th of the scale.

MultiVENT 2.0. In Table 1, we report the retrieval results for MultiVENT 2.0 on the compression methods. We are not able to build the index for the full model as comparable vision indices use hidden dimension of 2048 [38, 42, 53, 55], demonstrating that for large multimodal indices compression is necessary. Unlike ViDoRe and MSR-VTT, evaluating on MultiVENT 2.0 requires leveraging the audio information to retrieve the relevant videos. We found inefficient audio sampling to be major limitation of the Qwen-Omni model, suggesting interesting future work on how to pass audiovisual signal efficiently to MLLMs. For example, when training on the MultiVENT 2.0 data, we found that in order to fit batch size of 8, the audio signal needed to be reduced from 16KHz (Qwen-Omnis training rate) to 4KHz to fit on the devices.9 9Sampling audio below 4KHz degrades speech intelligibility [2].

            "content": "Compression Ranges. In Table 4, we explore learning different ranges of compression on MSR-VTT for 5 tokens (99.62%), 32 tokens (97.57%) and 128 tokens (90.29%). For SeqResize, we see that performance seems to be relatively flat across the compression ratios, with similar R@1 and nDCG@10 results. This is an interesting finding, largely suggesting that SeqResize may underutilize the budget and lead to suboptimal index (see further evidence in subsection 6.5). For all other methods, we see an increase in performance from the most extreme compression to lighter ratios. Additionally, we find H-Pools performance impressive as non-parametric technique at budget of 5. However, AGC continues to have strongest performance at each ratio, demonstrating its robustness to variety of compression ratios. Budget Sweeps. In Table 5, we analyze the impact of varying token budgets and the number of appending tokens of AGC on retrieval performance on MSR-VTT. We observe that performance scales positively with both the size of the token budget and the quantity of appending tokens. Notably, even under the most extreme compression setting (a budget of 5), AGC maintains robust performance, outperforming the single dense vector encoder, OmniEmbed-7B, despite using smaller 3B backbone. When looking at the number of appended query tokens and the budget, we find that it is generally optimal to align the number of appended query tokens and the budget size. Additionally, we see that 32 appended query tokens and budget of 5 outperforms 5 appended query tokens at the same budget, but we dont see the same pattern for 128 appended query tokens and 32 budget. This suggests that Qwen2.5-VL-3B Qwen2.5-VL-7B Qwen3-VL-4B 56.9 58.0 58.5 87.0 89.0 88.4 71.5 73.0 73. Table 7: Generalizability of AGC across different model sizes and variants. Results indicate consistent performance scaling with larger and newer model backbones. it is important to avoid low number of query tokens, but that performance doesnt necessarily scale to the number of appended query tokens at any budget. Compression Transferability. In Table 6, we again explore different ranges of compression on MSR-VTT, but only train the model for single compression ratio (i.e., training AGC for 32). We find that AGC provides the best ability to generalize to an unseen compression ratio after training. We attribute this finding to weakness in the heuristic of H-Pool, redundant visual tokens should not be equally merged. By leveraging attention to select centroids and weight the merging, AGC is better able to preserve salient semantic concepts and reduce the redundancy along the temporal dimension. We do not compare to MemTok and SeqResize in this experiment as they do not generalize to new compression ratios. Looking closer at the AGC results, we observe very close performance between methods trained for budgets of 5 and 128 and the method trained for 32 and tested on those budgets. This demonstrates that our model can transfer abilities between budgets at performance near training AGC for that compression ratio. Model Size and Backbone. In Table 7, we also provide an experiment on the stability of our method with different model size and with different underlying model. When scaling AGC to 7B parameter model, initializing from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, we find that performance is significantly improved. Additionally, we initialize our model from Qwen3-VL-4B and find that performance again improves over both Qwen2.5 versions. These results demonstrate that our method benefits from models with stronger representations and stronger encoding abilities, and should scale to any backbone or model size."

            "content": "In Figure 3, we visualize the difference in index utilization for full uncompressed indices and the four compression techniques and the similarity between document vectors in each index on MSRVTT. To calculate the matching strength, we sum the maximum similarity scores across all relevant query-document pairs in MSRVTT and normalize by the total number of match records at that query position. For the heatmaps, we calculate the cosine similarity between token vectors within each document, averaged across documents in the index of MSR-VTT. Token Utilization Analysis. Our analysis of index statistics reveals that of the 1.3 million unique document tokens, only 1% are active during single evaluation pass, with the base model primarily utilizing the first 2%.

Unlike MemTok, AGC and H-Pool use representations from the document leading to better utilization of the compressed representations in late interaction. Token Similarity Analysis. In the heatmaps of Figure 3, we further investigate the internal structure of these indices by visualizing the cosine similarity between document tokens. For the full model, we observe that the first few tokens, which we previously noted dominate late interaction, exhibit consistently high similarity ( 0.7) to nearly all other tokens in the document. Additionally, these initial tokens are highly similar to one another. This similarity explains the significant imbalance in matching strength observed in the corresponding bar chart. SeqResize presents distinct pattern where tokens that are never used in interaction display negative similarity. We interpret this as modeling failure; tokens derived from the same document context should theoretically maintain baseline degree of positive similarity, which SeqResize fails to capture. Conversely, MemTok demonstrates an over-smoothing problem, where the heatmap is dominated by high similarity scores. This lack of diversity restricts the expressive power of the index, as the tokens fail to capture distinct semantic nuances. H-Pool, by design, merges similar tokens and consequently produces the most diverse set of representations, as evidenced by the lower offdiagonal similarities. However, this suggests that similarity-based heuristics alone are not sufficient for optimal performance, as HPool does not perform as well as learned methods in many settings despite its high diversity. Finally, AGC shows trend similar to H-Pool but maintains decent inter-token similarities. This balance highlights the efficacy of our approach: it avoids the representation collapse seen in MemTok while preserving necessary semantic overlaps that H-Pool lacks, resulting in robust compressed index.

All correlations are statistically significant (𝑝 0.01), with Pearsons ranging from 0.959 to 0.996. can greatly benefit from compression. For SeqResize, we see unique trend amongst the compression methods, only selecting few tokens from the document representation in late interaction. This underutilization of the budget corroborates the findings of Table 4, where SeqResizes performance seemed to plateau across the compression ratios. For MemTok and AGC, we see that both methods attempt to utilize their full document representations. Because MemToks representations are appended to the document context, we see significant bias towards the first few tokens in the representation. This result largely follows the trend in dense encoding with causal language models to append token at the Preprint 26, 2026, Qin et al.

Significance levels: 𝑝 < 0.01, 𝑝 < 0.05. Predicting Performance with Utilization. Following from the above observations, we explore if it is possible to predict compression performance by only looking at how evenly distributed the strength of maximum similarity matches are in document representation. We calculate the Coefficient of Variation (CV) and the Gini coefficient. The CV assesses relative variability standardized by the mean 𝐶𝑉 = 𝜎 𝜇 100, while the Gini coefficient quantifies distributional concentration 𝐺 = 2 (cid:205) 𝑖𝑥𝑖 𝑛 . For both metrics, lower values 𝑛 (cid:205) 𝑥𝑖 indicate more evenly distributed activations. 𝑛+1 In Table 8 and Figure 4, we show the Pearsons correlation [40] between the retrieval metrics (R@1, nDCG@10, and MRR) and the inverse evenness metrics (Coefficient of Variation (CV) and Gini Coefficient).10 We find rough correlation between the evenness of the distribution of maximum similarity matches and retrieval performance. These results suggest that training late interaction methods to maximize the utility of each token in its document representations will lead to strong performance, which we leave for future work to explore. Additionally, this finding suggests that during development it is satisfactory to estimate the downstream performance of compression method with the distribution of maximum similarity matches on small set of queries. This is especially beneficial for multimodal tasks, where building indices is storage and time expensive."

            "content": "In Table 9, we perform an ablation analysis on the modeling choices in AGC using MSR-VTT. We examine the contribution of three components: Attention-based Centroid Selection, Clustering, and Weighted Aggregation. First, removing the attention weights (w/o Attn Weight) from the aggregation step leads to decline in performance. As discussed in subsection 5.3, weighting the contribution of tokens by their saliency scores is beneficial for balancing the hard assignment operation with optimization stability. Without these weights, the contribution of individual tokens becomes less continuous, rendering the optimization landscape rougher and less effective. Second, we analyze the impact of attention-based selection (w/o Attn Select) by replacing the learned universal query tokens with random selection strategy. This prevents the model from distinguishing signal from noise. While this randomness helps maintain some diversity, it forces the model to compress mixed information 10Because of the difficulty in obtaining different indices, we compute these correlations with 5 samples. Larger scale exploration is needed to further validate this finding.

This saturates the capacity of each vector and weakens its ability to capture complex, discriminative semantics. Finally, we evaluate the model without clustering (w/o Cluster), relying solely on attention selection. Without the clustering operation to reduce redundancy and aggregate context, the resulting representations lack diversity and expressiveness. Consequently, token matches in one evaluation pass become highly concentrated on narrow set of tokens, leading to worse performance. As shown in Figure 4, the progressive removal of Weighted Aggregation and Clustering leads to simultaneous decline in retrieval performance and evenness of MaxSim matches. This confirms that AGC effectively incentivizes balanced utilization while improving retrieval."

We adapt three strong text-based compression methods to multimodal documents: SeqResize (projection-based), MemTok (token-based), and H-Pool (heuristic-based), and introduce AGC, novel approach to multi-vector compression. AGC uses three main aspectsattention-based centroid selection, clustering, and weighted aggregationto maximize the utility of fixed document token budget. We find that AGC is strong and robust method to compress documents in any modality under variety of compression ratios, domains, and model specifications. AGC consistently outperforms the other compression methods across the modalities and even sets new state-of-the-art on MSR-VTT. Finally, we visualize how each method utilizes its index, demonstrating that AGC and H-Pool properly utilize their budgets, and show that downstream retrieval performance roughly correlates to how well utilized document representation is in late interaction. Future Work. While our work corroborates the understanding that multi-vector embeddings can be compressed with high compression ratio while retaining most retrieval performance, the budget is applied statically or potentially linearly in the case of H-Pool. natural extension would be to develop compression mechanisms that allocate the budget in proportion to documents inherent informational content, perhaps by using lightweight features like our document token utilization to calibrate the level of compression."
