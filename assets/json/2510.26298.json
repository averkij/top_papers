            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "The development of AI systems for web interaction has evolved from basic text-based assistants to more sophisticated tools that can understand and manipulate browser interfaces. OpenAIs ChatGPT Atlas represents recent advancement in this space, offering capabilities to analyze webpages, process user instructions, and perform cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser environment (OpenAI, 2025). While the system has shown promise for straightforward tasks like information retrieval, its performance in more dynamic, * indicates equal contributions. 1 interactive web environments remains less understood. This gap is notable, especially as benchmarks for generalist web agents (e.g., Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023)) and visual foundation agents (e.g., VisualAgentBench (Liu et al., 2024b)) have established the complexity of real-world digital tasks. While VisualAgentBench systematically compares multiple models across structured tasks, we conduct an in-depth behavioral analysis of single deployed system, examining how it handles the unpredictability of interactive web games and the integration challenges between analytical reasoning, motor control, and contextual understanding. Web-based games provide useful test scenarios for examining these interactive capabilities, as they offer clear performance metrics and cover diverse interaction typesfrom logical puzzles to real-time challenges. This approach follows long tradition of using games as AI benchmarks, famously exemplified by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016). Previous evaluations of web interaction systems have often focused on static tasks or simple navigation in constrained environments (Zhou et al., 2024), leaving open questions about how systems handle the timing and adaptation demands of highly interactive applications. In this work, we present an early evaluation of ChatGPT Atlas using several browser games to observe its web interaction capabilities. We examine how the system handles different types of tasks, focusing on four key aspects: 1. Analytical Processing: How well does Atlas understand game rules and objectives from webpage content? 2. Input Execution: How accurately does it translate intentions into cursor and keyboard actions? 3. Adaptive Behavior: Does it adjust its approach when encountering difficulties? Figure 1: ChatGPT Atlas being evaluated across different web games. The agent performs strategic moves in 2048 (Top-Left), logical placements in Sudoku (Top-Right), key presses for timing in T-Rex Runner (Bottom-Left), rapid taps for continuous control in Flappy Bird (Center), and exploration, navigation, game-understanding in Stein.world (Bottom-Right). 4. Contextual Understanding: How effectively does Atlas comprehend narrative instructions and pursue multi-step objectives in text-rich environments? We tested Atlas on multiple games including Googles T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, 2048, Flappy Bird, and the narrative-driven RPG (Role-Playing Game) Stein.world, using both quantitative performance metrics and qualitative behavioral analysis. Our observations show that while Atlas demonstrates capable analytical reasoning in puzzle games like Sudoku, it encounters significant challenges in real-time games requiring precise timing and coordination. In RPG environments, Atlas shows heavy dependence on explicit instructions and struggles with contextual narrative understanding and autonomous objective pursuit. Interestingly, we also noted several adaptive behaviors, such as attempting to activate cheat modes when struggling and adjusting interaction strategies over multiple attempts. These preliminary observations provide initial insights into Atlass current capabilities and limitations for interactive web tasks, suggesting directions for further investigation of web-based AI systems."

            "content": "Web Interaction Agents The development of AI systems for web interaction has progressed from script-based automation and traditional testing frameworks (Kertusha et al., 2025) to sophisticated neural approaches. Contemporary systems increasingly leverage large language models and multimodal architectures for improved generalization across diverse web environments (Ning et al., 2025). Recent benchmarks have established comprehensive evaluation protocols, with WebLINX focusing on multi-turn conversational navigation (Lù et al., 2024) and WebVoyager demonstrating end-to-end task completion using large multimodal models (He et al., 2024). However, recent critical analysis suggests potential over-optimism in reported capabilities, with significant performance gaps emerging under rigorous online evaluation (Xue et al., 2025). State-of-the-art systems exhibit diverse architectural approaches: CogAgent specializes in GUI understanding through high-resolution visual processing (Hong et al., 2024), while WebSight adopts vision-first paradigm that operates purely through screenshots without HTML dependency (Bhathal and Gupta, 2025). The field is increasingly mov2 ing toward more dynamic evaluation frameworks, with benchmarks like WebCanvas addressing online environments (Pan et al., 2024) and RealWebAssist focusing on long-horizon assistance with real-world users (Ye et al., 2025). WebWalker further extends evaluation to systematic web traversal tasks (Wu et al., 2025). ChatGPT Atlas represents the latest evolution in this trajectory, integrating direct browser control within general-purpose multimodal framework to enable seamless task execution across diverse web environments. AI and Game Evaluation Games have long served as standardized probes for interactive competence, with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) establishing multi-game protocol for evaluating general agents across diverse Atari tasks (Bellemare et al., 2013). More recently, LLM/VLM-oriented benchmarks extend this paradigm to contemporary agent stacks: BALROG evaluates agentic reasoning of language and vision-language models across challenging, longhorizon game environments with fine-grained metrics (Paglieri et al., 2025), while Orak targets diverse real-world video games and emphasizes modular agentic components and standardized connection interfaces for reproducible evaluation (Park et al., 2025). Complementary open-ended frameworks such as MCU situate evaluation in Minecraft with compositional task generation and humanaligned scoring, highlighting scalability and difficulty control in sandbox settings (Zheng et al., 2025). Parallel to benchmarking for play quality, work on automatic playtesting uses LLMs to drive coverage and defect discovery (e.g., snapshottomatrix perception with prompting-based action for match-3 games), foregrounding QA outcomes rather than agent interaction competence per se (Zhao and Tang, 2025). Multimodal Web Understanding Multimodal web understanding has increasingly emphasized fine-grained grounding and layout-aware reasoning under real websites and realistic UI tasks. Benchmarks such as VisualWebBench target screenshotbased OCR, understanding, and element grounding across diverse, text-rich pages, revealing persistent gapsparticularly under low-resolution inputs and dense typography (Liu et al., 2024a). WebMMU further unifies three core web taskswebsite VQA, HTML/CSS/JS code editing with functional preservation, and mockup-to-code generationon expertannotated real webpages, and reports that current MLLMs struggle with precise grounding, multistep reasoning, and maintaining functionality during editing and generation, including multilingual settings (Awal et al., 2025). Within the broader MLLM landscape, surveys catalog evaluation axes spanning perception/understanding, cognition/reasoning, domains, and modalities, situating web-focused resources like VisualWebBench and WebMMU inside larger benchmark taxonomy that is still evolving (Li et al., 2024). Our preliminary evaluation contributes to this landscape by providing initial observations of ChatGPT Atlass performance across different types of web-based games, focusing on practical interaction capabilities rather than specialized game-playing performance."

            "title": "3.2 Experimental Design",
            "content": "We employed mixed-methods evaluation approach, combining quantitative performance assessment across four structured games with qualitative behavioral analysis of MMORPG environment. For the quantitative assessment, we conducted 10 independent trials for each of four games featuring standardized performance metrics, as shown in Table. 1: T-Rex Runner: Final score (distance traveled) and obstacle clearance rate Sudoku: Completion time with 100% accuracy requirement Flappy Bird: Survival score (pipes cleared) 2048: Final score and strategic progression Complementing this quantitative analysis, we conducted qualitative case study using the RPG (Role-Playing Games) Stein.world to examine Atlass capabilities in open-ended, narrative-driven environments. As MMORPG lacking standardized performance metrics, this component focused on observational analysis of interaction patterns, instructional comprehension, and adaptive behaviors during initial task completion. 4 Human baseline data was collected from established sources: Sudoku completion times from published averages (10-12 minutes for medium difficulty), T-Rex Runner, Flappy Bird, and 2048 scores from initial human trials. 3.3 Experimental Observations Our experiments revealed clear dichotomy in ChatGPT Atlass performance based on the motor and cognitive demands of each game. We categorize the games into three distinct types based on their interaction requirements: High Motor-Demand Games: Require precise timing and continuous control (T-Rex Runner, Flappy Bird) Low Motor-Demand, High Strategy Games: Emphasize analytical reasoning with minimal real-time demands (Sudoku) Exploration-Intensive Games: Require interface discovery and strategic adaptation (2048, Stein.world) T-Rex Runner: Systematic Timing Failures In T-Rex Runner, Atlas achieved an average score of 45.5 points (σ=2.92), representing only 11.7% of the human baseline performance (388.9 points). The model failed to pass the first obstacle in 9 out of 10 trials, with failure analysis revealing consistent late jump timing. During experiment, Atlas demonstrated awareness of its limitations by attempting to activate the games \"start slower\" option. The interaction sequence was: 1) Mouse hover over game settings area; 2) Click on settings icon (when visible); 3) Attempt to locate and activate \"start slower\" or difficulty reduction. While this adaptation strategy showed problemsolving intent, the game interface did not provide accessible difficulty controls, preventing successful execution. Flappy Bird: Uncoordinated Motor Control Atlas demonstrated complete failure in Flappy Bird, achieving 0 points across all 10 trials compared to human baseline scores of 1-6 points in initial attempts as shown in Table. 2. The failure mode analysis revealed erratic and uncoordinated tapping patterns without rhythmic timing relative to the birds descent trajectory. Game T-Rex Runner Sudoku Flappy Bird 2048 Metric Average Score Completion Time Average Score Average Score Atlas Performance 45.5 (σ=2.92) 2m28s (σ=29s) 0 2242.0 (σ=1189.0) Human Baseline 388.9 (σ=325.9) 1012m 2.9 (initial attempts) 3463.2 (σ=2219.5) Performance Gap 88.3% 75% (faster) 100% 35.3% Table 1: Empirical Performance Results Across Web Games. σ denotes the standard deviation.

The values represent the number of pipes successfully passed per trial, where higher scores indicate better performance. Atlas failed to pass any pipes across all ten trials. In observation, Atlas systematically increased its click frequency from trial to trial. However, this adaptation failed to improve performance because the clicks lacked temporal coordination with the games physics. The model increased quantity of inputs without improving quality of timing. Sudoku: Efficient Logical Reasoning In contrast to the motor-demand games, Atlas demonstrated exceptional performance in Sudoku, completing medium-difficulty puzzles with 100% accuracy in an average time of 2 minutes 28 seconds (σ=29 seconds). This represents 4.5x speed advantage over the human baseline of 10-12 minutes. Strategy Analysis: Atlas employed systematic approach: 1. Complete board analysis and constraint identification 2. Mathematical modeling of possible number placements 3. Sequential input of numbers without hesitation or correction 5 4. Direct cursor selection of cells followed by number key presses The models performance indicates sophisticated pattern recognition and logical deduction capabilities when freed from real-time motor coordination demands. 2048: Control Exploration with Minimal Planning In 2048, Atlas demonstrated distinct exploration-then-execution pattern but achieved minimal strategic progress, typically reaching only the 64-tile before stalling. Observed Interaction Sequence: 1. Initial exploration phase: (a) Mouse clicking on directional arrows; (b) Testing keyboard arrow keys; (c) Discovering WASD controls. During this phase, Atlas moved deliberately and at noticeably slower pace, suggesting an emphasis on learning how to operate the interface. 2. Execution phase: (a) Fixed loop: 10 iterations of [Up, Right, Down, Left]; (b) State assessment pause; (c) Random directional moves until stuck. Once control understanding was established, execution proceeded much fasterAtlas cycled through the fixed movement sequence with high speed across ten loops. 3. Adaptation attempt: (a) \"New Game\" button click when progress stalled; (b) Repeat exploration with similar results. Despite successful interface discovery, Atlas exhibited no evidence of understanding the games core strategy of corner consolidation and tile merging. The fixed movement patterns, rapid execution, and random subsequent moves suggest an absence of strategic planning or state-value assessment. Stein.world: Textual Understanding and Task Execution in RPG games. After receiving the initial prompt, Try your best to explore and play the game. Stop when you get stuck, Atlas spent Figure 2: Layout of the Stein.world starting area and the location of the first task. The player begins in the spawn room and must navigate outside to speak with the NPC Cleaning Lady to advance the storyline. Atlas initially failed to exit the room despite extended attempts, but after receiving detailed operational instructions, it successfully completed the task. several minutes exploring how to operate the game, including moving the player and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or items. Initially, Atlas attempted to move the character by leftor right-clicking. It later discovered that movement was controlled via the WASD keys. The first in-game task required the player to speak with an NPC named Cleaning Lady to advance the storyline. This character is located outside the room where the player initially spawns, as illustrated in Figure 2. The player must therefore navigate out of the starting room and interact with the NPC to continue. However, Atlas spent more than twenty minutes attempting to exit the room and ultimately failed to do so. Notably, even after discovering that movement could be performed using the keyboard, Atlas continued to intermittently use mouse clicks for navigation and interaction. Throughout most of the gameplay session, Atlas spent significant time deliberating on what action to take nextsuch as deciding whether to press WASDbefore finally returning control to the user after being unable to exit the room. To further investigate Atlass ability to play role-playing game (RPG), we provided more detailed prompt: Try your best to play the game. You can move using the WASD keys and press to interact with NPCs or items while standing directly beside them. The first task is to talk to the Cleaning Lady. Continue playing the game until you get stuck. As expected, with more explicit instructions, Atlas adapted more quickly to the game mechanics. Within eight minutes, it successfully navigated the player outside the room and picked up an item of clothing (pants) from the floor, although it misidentified the item as stool. After approximately fifteen minutes, Atlas completed the first task of speaking with the Cleaning Lady and was subsequently assigned the next quest: to find used shirt in the west room. Despite another fifteen minutes of play, Atlas made limited progress in exploration, as it spent considerable time deliberating on each next action rather than efficiently executing movement commands. Eventually, after failing to locate the used shirt, Atlas returned control to the user."

            "title": "3.4 Summary of Behavioral Patterns",
            "content": "The consistent patterns across game types reveal fundamental characteristics of Atlass web interaction capabilities: Motor Control Gap: Significant limitations in timing precision and continuous control. 6 Analytical Strength: Superior performance in logical reasoning and systematic problemsolving. Instruction Dependence: Heavy reliance on explicit operational guidance, with limited capacity for inferring objectives from contextual narrative. Adaptive Intent: Awareness of limitations manifested through control frequency adjustments and setting modifications. Strategic Deficiency: Interface exploration without developing sophisticated game strategies. These observations suggest that while ChatGPT Atlas possesses advanced analytical capabilities for structured tasks, it faces substantial challenges in dynamic environments requiring precise motor coordination, real-time adaptation, and contextual understanding. The models performance demonstrates excellence in rule-based analytical tasks while struggling with open-ended environments that require narrative comprehension, implicit objective inference, and sustained goal-directed behavior. Operational Challenges Several games revealed fundamental operational limitations of Atlas. In 2048, Atlas did not demonstrate the expected ability to develop strategy for determining the optimal next step. Instead, it spent time exploring how to operate the gameinitially attempting to click tiles to make moves. After discovering that movements could be performed using the W, A, S, and keys, Atlas executed approximately ten random loops of swirling sequences, each consisting of four directional moves, totaling about forty movements. Surprisingly, after these iterations, Atlas did not attempt to analyze the board state or formulate new strategy for subsequent moves. Rather, it repeated another set of ten random swirling loops. The overall progress was slow, with the best performance being 512-tile achieved across ten trials before getting stuck or returning control. These observations highlight Atlass difficulties with goal comprehension and sequential decision-making in the context of playing web-based games."

            "content": "Our observations revealed two main patterns: strong performance in analytical tasks like Sudoku contrasted with significant challenges in realtime control and precise operation. The consistent failures in reflex-based games suggest limitations in motor control and timing precision, while the operational difficulties in games like 2048 and Stein.world indicate challenges with basic interface manipulation. It is worth noting that these games were not designed as comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, but rather as scenarios for observing web interaction behaviors. The small sample size and limited trial counts mean these observations should be considered preliminary. However, the consistent patterns across different game types provide useful initial insights into Atlass current capabilities and limitations for interactive web tasks."

            "title": "4 Conclusion",
            "content": "Our empirical evaluation of ChatGPT Atlass web interaction capabilities across five game types reveals system with notable analytical strengths but significant limitations in execution, adaptation, and contextual understanding. The model demonstrates robust performance in static, turn-based environments requiring logical reasoning and systematic analysisexcelling in puzzle games like Sudoku and showing competent strategic understanding in 2048. However, Atlas exhibits substantial limitations across multiple dimensions: in dynamic, realtime environments requiring low-latency motor control, in strategic planning for tile-based games like 2048, and crucially, in narrative comprehension and objective pursuit in RPG environments. The performance gap between analytical tasks and real-time execution challenges suggests that while Atlas represents significant advancement in webbased AI assistance, it has not yet achieved generalized proficiency across the full spectrum of interactive web tasks. These findings indicate that current browser control capabilities, while effective for information retrieval and structured task completion, remain insufficient for applications requiring precise motor coordination, strategic planning in dynamic systems, and nuanced comprehension of narrative context."
