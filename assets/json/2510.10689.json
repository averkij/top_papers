            "title": "1 Introduction",
            "content": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently made impressive progress in bridging vision, language, and audio (Yin et al., 2024; Song et al., 2025; Cheng et al., 2025). While early benchmarks primarily focused on image-text alignment or visual reasoning (Xu et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2024a; Yue et al., 2024a), the integration of video and audio presents quite different challenge: models must jointly process long temporal sequences, dynamic scene transitions, and complementary acoustic cues. Despite rapid advances, evaluation of MLLMs on audio-visual reasoning remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks (Li et al., 2024a; Hong et al., 2025) often (i) focus on short video clips that underrepresent long-term temporal dependencies, (ii) emphasize single modality (e.g., vision) while treating audio as auxiliary or optional. As result, current evaluations fail to capture the challenges inherent to comprehensive video understanding, where audio and vision must be integrated consistently and logically to support robust inference. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniVideoBench, high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating audio-visual reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Specifically, first, we collect 628 diverse videos spanning up to 30 minutes across 8 major categories and 68 subcategories, covering realistic contexts such as news, sports, documentaries, vlogs, and ego-centric recordings. Then, we construct 1,000 high-quality question-answer pairs based on these videos, and each pair is annotated with step-by-step reasoning chains as shown in Figure 1, where these reasoning steps explicitly indicate modality and evidence information. This design not only strengthens the reliability of the evaluation but also provides unique signal for analyzing how models reason, rather than just the final answers. Based on our OmniVideoBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source MLLMs, and several insightful findings are as follows: OmniVideoBench poses significant challenges for Omni-Modal Language Models. Current MLLMs have not achieved passing score (<60%) on OmniVideoBench. The best-performing model, Gemini-2.0-Pro, only achieves an accuracy of 58.90%. Except for the newly proposed Qwen3-Omni, the performance of open-source models is close to random. 1 Figure 1: Examples in OmniVideoBench (V presents vision and presents audio), and we present the atomic reasoning traces for these examples. Omni-understanding abilities on long videos have significant improvement room. Although some leading models (such as Gemini-2.5-pro) demonstrate relatively robust performance on long videos, other models (e.g., Gemini-2.0-Flash, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B) still struggle on long video understanding. Performance varies lot for videos with different audio signals. Gemini-2.5-Pro only achieves 38.46% accuracy on videos with music signal, while the results on sound and speech are 57.72% and 61.66%, respectively. Performance on different task types differs lot. For example, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves accuracy below 50% on the background and music understanding task, which requires low-semantic acoustic cues (e.g., musical style, tempo changes), and the accuracy results on the relationship reasoning and summarization tasks are more than 80%."

            "content": "OmniVideoBench is benchmark for evaluating the audio-visual collaborative reasoning of MLLMs. The main task in the evaluation requires model to process video, its audio, and associated text to generate textual answer supported by explicit reasoning steps. This process assesses the models ability to synthesize information across modalities, from recognizing objects to comprehending complex scene dynamics and context. This section details the benchmarks design principles, annotation protocols, and dataset statistics. 2 Figure 2: The complete pipeline of data collection, annotation, and refinement, where filtering and refinement serve as two key processes for quality assurance."

            "content": "OmniVideoBench is composed of real-world videos sourced from YouTube1 and Bilibili2. These videos feature rich audiovisual content. Therefore, comprehensive understanding necessitates the accurate processing and integration of both audio and visual modalities for reasoning. Regarding video richness, we primarily focus on two dimensions: type and duration. For type diversity, we categorize videos into eight broad classes: Vlog, News, Cartoon, Sports, Documentary, TV, Ego, and Others. Each class is further subdivided into nearly seventy fine-grained subcategories, which facilitates video retrieval and ensures broad coverage. Video categories are unevenly distributed. News and documentary videos have dense audio that nearly covers visual content, making them unsuitable for audio-visual reasoning tasks; thus, we manually controlled the video type distribution. For duration diversity, we restrict video lengths to the range of several seconds to 30 minutes, so as to evaluate reasoning across varying temporal scales. Building upon this foundation, we established set of rigorous video collection criteria that not only ensure the quality of the videos themselves, like resolution, but also guarantee the richness and diversity of their audio and visual content. To further avoid data overlap with existing training sets (e.g., popular TV shows), we restrict the selection to recent publications. The detailed collection principles are provided in Appendix B."

            "title": "2.3 Data Annotation",
            "content": "After collecting high-quality videos, we carried out manual annotation. Compared with automated annotation, automated methods cap the evaluation ceiling by the capabilities of the annotating model, whereas manual annotation produces questions that are closer to real-world needs. In Figure 2, we first designed multiple-choice questions consisting of the question stem, the correct answer, and several distractors, to facilitate convenient evaluation of model performance. At this stage, we obtained approximately 2,500 QA pairs. We categorize the tasks into 13 types: Fine-grained Perception, Spatial Reasoning, Attribute Comparison, Background & Music Understanding, Counting, Temporal Understanding, Summarization, Sentiment Analysis, Causal Reasoning, Relationship Reasoning, Reference Reasoning, Ego Reasoning, and Hypothetical Reasoning. In this design, each question requires reliance on audio-visual reasoning, and the answer must be both correct and unique with no alternative plausible interpretations in the video. Moreover, we require that questions should not depend on video resolution or frame rate. Cases where the target object is extremely small, blurred, and barely recognizable to the human eye, or where the relevant event occurs only within an instant, are excluded. In addition, we established the following rules to minimize the interference caused by extraneous textual information. Questions should avoid redundant information. We minimize unnecessary details in the question text, such as the gender, clothing, or exact speech of characters, as long as doing so does not affect the correctness or uniqueness of the answer. This serves two purposes: reducing textual cues that the model could exploit and increasing question difficulty to better test its audio-visual understanding. The length of answers is capped. To prevent the answer text itself from providing excessive cues to 1https://www.youtube.com/ 2https://www.bilibili.com/ 3 Video Statistics Annotation Statistics #Major Categories #Subcategories Avg.

This constraint ensures that the results more faithfully capture the models multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities. The format of options must be consistent. Here, format refers to aspects such as length, tone, style, and variation patterns. If these features are inconsistent, they may provide the model with unintended cues for reasoning. For instance, when three options are considerably longer than the remaining one, when three options adopt casual tone while the other is markedly formal, such discrepancies undermine the assumption that each option should have an equal probability of being chosen, thereby compromising the fairness of the evaluation. Negative options must be relevant to the question. We require that all distractors appear in the video and maintain relevance to the question. Without this constraint, the model could easily eliminate distractors, greatly reducing the need for reasoning. Options should maintain consistent semantic distance. We formalize semantic distance as the number of differing semantic units between options. Let an option oi be represented as set of semantic units Si. The semantic distance between two options oi and oj is defined as: d(oi, oj) = SiSj (1) where denotes the symmetric difference, capturing the distinct semantic units between two options. To prevent models from exploiting unbalanced textual cues rather than performing genuine audio-visual reasoning, we require that all distractors have consistent distances from one another and from the correct option."

            "content": "We employed an advanced MLLM (i.e., Gemini 2.0 Flash), with strong audiovisual perception and comprehension capabilities, as well as long-context processing ability, to filter out questions that could be resolved using only single modality. If the model successfully selected the correct answer with plausible explanation while relying solely on unimodal information, the corresponding question was removed. After this filtering stage, approximately 1,500 questions were retained. Subsequently, we employed large language model, DeepSeek-V3.1 (Liu et al., 2024a), with strong reasoning capabilities to filter out questions that could be answered solely based on textual information. Such cases primarily fall into two categories: first, questions that involve classical, well-known, or universally shared knowledge or objects, which can be answered without reference to the video content; and second, questions where the phrasing of the question, options, or answers provides unintended textual cues. For the former, we directly discarded the questions. For the latter, our annotators reviewed the reasoning process generated by the model and revised the textual formulations to eliminate such biases. After this stage of refinement, 1103 questions were retained. Another group of annotators conducts the final refinement stage, thoroughly reviewing all questions to identify and remove those with incorrect, non-unique, or mismatched answers. After this validation, annotators enriched each question with step-by-step reasoning chains, where each step consists of three elements: modality, evidence, and inference. The modality specifies whether the step relies on audio or visual information; the evidence denotes the specific information extracted from the video; and the inference describes the reasoning derived from that information. We required each step to be atomic, meaning that it should involve only one modality and capture minimal unit of evidence, such as spoken sentence, an action, or the appearance of character. This design ensures that the reasoning process is both detailed and comprehensive. Through this process, we obtained 1000 high-quality QA pairs with explicit step-by-step reasoning chains, forming robust dataset for multimodal audio-visual reasoning. 4 Figure 3: (a) OmniVideoBench covers 8 major categories and 68 subcategories.

Unlike human voices conveying explicit semantic content or ambient sounds often corresponding to specific visual events, music primarily encodes abstract emotional and atmospheric information. Current MLLMs demonstrate limited capability to translate such implicit cues into effective reasoning, indicating that cross-modal alignment for emotional and atmospheric understanding remains an urgent challenge to be addressed. Current MLLMs still have room for improvement in long videos. Although some leading models like Gemini-2.5-Pro demonstrate relatively robust performance on long videos, most MLLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.0-Flash, Qwen3-Omni) still struggle in long videos, which highlights the widespread challenge in understanding long videos."

            "content": "Performance of Models on Tasks across Different Types. Figure 5 presents fine-grained comparison of model accuracy on the 13 reasoning categories in OmniVideoBench. Several consistent patterns emerge. (1). Closed-source MLLMs demonstrate superior performance across nearly all task types. Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest accuracy on 11 out of 13 tasks, demonstrating particularly strong performance in Relationship Reasoning, Spatial Reasoning, Referential Reasoning, and Cause and Effect Reasoning. These tasks require long-term sequence integration and multi-step cross-modal reasoning, highlighting Geminis strengths in long-context modeling and multimodal fusion. (2). MLLMs understanding of audio remains limited to relatively superficial surface-level information. Whether open-source or closed-source models, Background and Music Understanding remains the most challenging task, with even Gemini-2.5-Pro achieving accuracy below 50%. This is probably because such tasks require linking low-semantic acoustic cues (e.g., musical style, tempo changes) with high-level reasoning, while current models struggle to master the capability. In contrast, Relationship Reasoning and Summarization are relatively easier. This may be because they rely more on recognizing language within audio and visual observation capabilities, and less on cross-modal abstraction abilities. Effect of ASR Transcripts for Visual Only MLLMs. To further investigate the role of audio information in MLLMs reasoning performance, we evaluate several models using both the automatic speech recogni7 (a) Accuracy rates of selected MLLMs under different inputs.

The results are shown in Figure 6. The observations are as follows: (1). Open-source models demonstrate weaker integration capabilities for audio information compared to their understanding of textual information. In Figure 6a, all tested models demonstrate significantly improved accuracy after extracting ASR text information compared to receiving only visual inputs. However, the Qwen2.5-Omni7B model, which processes both visual and audio inputs simultaneously, performed even worse than the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model with equivalent parameters. This highlights common challenge faced by most open-source Omni-Modal Language Models: insufficient cross-modal reasoning capabilities for audio-visual information. (2). In cross-modal video reasoning, audio comprehension capabilities remain irreplaceable by ASR. In Figure 6b, although ASR can help MLLMs achieve decent performance on certain tasks requiring speech recognition capabilities, its effectiveness is extremely limited for tasks demanding deeper and more abstract audio comprehension such as the videos whose audio type is Music or Sound. Models Open-ended QA MCQ Effect of Different Numbers of Frames. We conduct experiments on Qwen2.5-Omni7B and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B with total frame counts fixed at 32, 64, 128, and 256, respectively, and observe that both models benefit from more frequent time sampling. In Figure 7a, as the total frame counts increase, accuracy steadily improves, likely because richer temporal coverage provides more complete motion cues and reduces the risk of missing key events. As shown in Figure 7b, this improvement becomes more pronounced for longer videos. The consistent gains across different video durations further indicate that dense frame sampling not only captures fine-grained visual dynamics but also strengthens cross-modal alignment. This highlights the importance of dense temporal Table 4: Comparison of performance on Open-ended Question Answering (QA) and MultipleChoice Questions (MCQ) across various models.

To investigate whether the multiple-choice question (MCQ) format overstates model performance, we additionally evaluated several representative models on open-ended question-answering (QA) tasks, where no predefined answer options are provided. In this setting, models must directly generate textual responses, eliminating both the possibility of random guessing and any lexical cues potentially present in candidate options. In Table 4, the accuracy of all models drops significantly compared to their performance on multiple-choice questions. For instance, the Gemini-2.5-Pro, which leads in MCQ benchmarks, experiences relative accuracy decline exceeding 14 percent in open-ended scenarios, while open-source models exhibit even steeper drops."

            "content": "Omni-Understanding MLLMs. The development of MLLMs (Chen et al., 2022; Awadalla et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) began with foundational focus on integrating the two primary modalities of vision and language. recent paradigm shift aims to develop Omni-modal MLLMs capable of processing and generating information across an arbitrary combination of modalities (Any-to-Any\"). This approach positions the LLM as central cognitive engine, unifying diverse data types like audio, video, and text within its semantic space (Liu et al., 2024b; Yuan et al., 2025). This has driven move from integrating pre-trained unimodal components towards developing natively multimodal\" architectures trained from the ground up, as exemplified by models like GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024). This ambition is showcased by state-of-the-art models (Xu et al., 2025c; Zhao et al., 2025; Li et al., 2024c; 2025; Yao et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025b), which pioneer end-to-end streaming capabilities for simultaneously processing video and audio to generate text and speech. At the forefront of this paradigm, proprietary models like Gemini series (Team, 2024; Comanici et al., 2025) demonstrate pinnacle performance, powered by natively multimodal design and massive context window that together unlock superior understanding of complex, interwoven data streams. MLLM Benchmarks. The landscape of MLLM evaluation has matured significantly, evolving from foundational perception benchmarks (Liu et al., 2024c; Li et al., 2024a; Yu et al., 2024a;b; Chen et al., 2024b; Jiang et al., 2025) to more sophisticated frameworks (He et al., 2025; Du et al., 2025). Recent efforts probe deeper cognitive abilities, with MLLM-Bench (Ge et al., 2025) assessing hierarchy of cognitive skills. MMMU (Yue et al., 2023) and MMMU-Pro (Yue et al., 2024b) challenging models with expert-level, multi-disciplinary reasoning under stricter protocols like vision-only inputs. Simultaneously, evaluation has specialized into high-stakes domains such as finance (Gan et al., 2024) and medicine (Chen et al., 2024c). For video, some benchmarks (Wang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021; 2023; Fang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024) now focus on the critical challenge of long-context temporal understanding (Liu et al., 2025c), revealing key limitations in current models."

            "content": "We presented OmniVideoBench, large-scale benchmark for evaluating audio-visual collaborative reasoning in MLLMs, with diverse videos, carefully verified QA pairs, and explicit reasoning annotations. Experiments show that both openand closed-source models still struggle with modality complementarity, long-form temporal reasoning, and music understanding, underscoring large gap from human-level performance. We hope this benchmark will drive future research toward more robust and generalizable multimodal reasoning systems."

            "title": "B Detailed Principles of Video Collection",
            "content": "To ensure an objective and reliable evaluation of MLLMs, the videos included in the benchmark must satisfy multiple requirements, ensuring diversity in both type and duration. The content should provide rich information across audio and visual modalities, while maintaining complementarity between the two. In other words, the benchmark avoids cases where the visual content can be fully inferred from the audio alone, or where the audio is redundant given the visual stream. Furthermore, since many existing video training datasets overlap with the sources of our benchmarkfor example, clips from Friendsevaluation may otherwise reduce to simple answer memorization. To mitigate this unfairness, we additionally consider the publication year of videos when constructing the dataset. The detailed principles for video collection are as follows: Video publication date. Given that most existing training datasets are constructed from YouTube videos, similar to ours, or contain overlapping content such as identical TV shows, we restrict our selection to videos published after June 2024. We use the most recent videos possible to mitigate unfairness and potential overestimation issues arising from the model having already been exposed to similar content during training. Rich dynamic visual information. The distinguishing feature of videos compared to images lies in their rich dynamic visual information. prerequisite for evaluating models ability to understand visual information in videos is that the videos themselves contain sufficient dynamic content to be captured and analyzed. Consequently, videos lacking diverse dynamic visual information are excluded, such as those consisting of only several static scenes or perspectives throughout, or those that remain largely static with minimal motion confined to small corner of the frame. Effective audio information. In some videos, the audio is completely unrelated to the visual content, such as when only an independent background track is added. We consider such audio to be invalid. To fairly evaluate the models capability in audio-visual collaborative reasoning, the audiowhether speech, environmental sound, or musicmust align with the visual content. Absence of subtitle. We excluded videos with embedded subtitles, as such practices convey most of the audio information visually, enabling models to cheat through vision alone. Likewise, videos containing large text overlays were regarded as undesirable, since these overlays often 16 directly reveal information about characters speech, mental states, or ongoing events, thereby undermining the assessment of the models genuine understanding and reasoning abilities. Video resolution. To ensure video quality, we require minimum resolution of 480p, and the visual content must be free from issues such as distortion or blurriness that would hinder comprehension."
