            "content": "Emerging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] can perform high-level reasoning and scene interpretation [8, 9]. Recent robotic manipulation systems that integrate VLMs demonstrate enhanced capabilities in semantic and long horizon task reasoning [10, 11, 12]. Yet, the key challenge persists: the image-text corpora used for VLM pre-training high-quality lack fine-grained spatial information, which are prerequisites for robots to identify long-tail objects, complex scenes, reason about spatial relationships, and plan physical interactions. To address this challenge, some research [13, 14, 15] relies on data generation through simulation [16, 17, 18]. However, such data has inherent limitations due to the sim-to-real gap, because simulator cannot accurately model visual properties such as noise, clutter, and lighting variations and physical properties such as contact dynamics, and interactions. Therefore, strong performance in simulation often fails to translate reliably to the physical world. Meanwhile, deriving spatial knowledge from real-world (in-the-wild) data typically requires extensive and costly human labeling [19, 20]. In contrast, teleoperated robot trajectories that are used to train visuomotor policies [21], such as VisionLanguage-Action(VLA) [10, 22] or diffusion policies [23], typically include precise, structured proprioceptive and kinematic informationjoint angles, end-effector poses, gripper states, and Preprint. Figure 1: Robo2VLM-1 dataset overview. The middle colorbar traces typical manipulation episodefrom pre-grasp through immobilization, contact, detach, and into post-grasp. Surrounding panels give example questions for each VQA category. Dashed arrows connect every category to the phase(s) in which its questions are sampled. Icons beneath each panel list the key sensing modalities (RGB, stereo depth, wrist/side cameras, gripper state, end-effector pose, language instructions) needed to derive ground-truth answers. forcetorque readingsthat implicitly encode 3D spatial information. We hypothesize that visual and textual data extracted from robot trajectories can improve VLMs spatial reasoning capabilities. We present Robo2VLM, multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs from real-world robot data. Given human-teleoperated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM segments the trajectory into distinct manipulation phases, selects representative frames from each phase, and generates questions whose answers are supported by synchronized proprioceptive and kinematic ground truth. We apply Robo2VLM to 176k diverse, real-world trajectories from the Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset [24], producing over 3 million VQA samples. Inspired by data optimization paradigms such as domain reweighting in natural language processing [25] and robot policy learning [26], we curate Robo2VLM-1, large-scale, in-the-wild VQA dataset with 684,710 questions covering 463 distinct scenes, 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks, and 149 manipulation skills. We evaluate 14 model configurations with state-of-the-art open source models (LLaVA, Llama and Qwen) and with different parameter sizes and prompting techniques. The results indicate that some VLMs can achieve near human performance in questions related to object reachability and interaction understanding. Evaluation also suggests significant gap to human performance, especially in complex reasoning of fine-grained spatial relationship and interactions. Finetuning LLaVA [4] with Robo2VLM-1 improves most of the spatial and interaction capabilities with increasing training dataset size, with maximum 50% accuracy gain in state reasoning and task understanding. This paper makes the following contributions: (1) Robo2VLM, VQA data generation framework from real robot trajectories. (2) Robo2VLM-1, an open VQA dataset with 684,710 questions covering diverse and realistic evaluation scenarios for manipulation. (3) Extensive evaluation data on state-ofthe-art and fine-tuned VLMs."

Crucially for grounding VLMs, robotics datasets from Open-X-Embodiment contains rich sensory-modal including RGB video, proprioceptive [31, 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44], depth data [31, 28, 32, 33, 35], and force-torque [37, 39, 40, 41], that reflect the dynamics of interaction. These information presents an opportunity to bridge robotics data with VLMs. VQA Benchmarks for Robotics and Embodied AI VQA offers powerful paradigm for evaluating the visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs [45, 46, 47]. Recently, VQA benchmarks have been developed for robotic tasks such as visual navigation in long-horizon planning [48, 49]. Simulationbased approaches [13, 14, 15] (often utilizing environments like [16, 17, 18]) generate large-scale VQA dataset, but face the persistent sim-to-real domain gap, where the result may not hold in reality due to factors like noise, clutter, and lighting variations. Real-world data benchmark, such as RoboVQA [19] (human-verified Q/A), improve generalization to real world setting but often involve significant manual annotation effort. These methods typically do not fully automate VQA generation by exploiting the rich spectrum of non-visual modalities (e.g., force, torque, proprioception), limiting their ability to support questions grounded in concepts such as grasp stability or multi-view spatial alignment. In contrast, Robo2VLM reduces the need for manual annotation and enables interaction and physical properties reasoning that are underexplored in previous VQA benchmarks, such as gripper states, grasping stability, task goal, and spatial information focus on the robot and target objects."

            "content": "Embodied Scene Understanding Given task description in nature language and all images from different camera views, we first parse the language instruction using an off-the-shelf LLM such as Qwen 2.5 [2] to obtain {target object}, scene, task, and skill description. For the spatial understanding in manipulation, we need to know the relative direction and displacement between target object and gripper. From the proprioceptive data, we obtain the target object interaction point ground-truth from the robot trajectory data frames. Manipulation Phase Segmentation To segment robotic manipulation trajectories into semantically meaningful phases, we define temporal phase classification function based on the sequence of endeffector poses, gripper aperture signals, and force-torque measurements: pEE , f1:T . To align different types of gripper aperture, sGripper is normalized to [0, 1], where 0 indicates fully open and 1 indicates fully closed. Let st [0, 1] denote the normalized aperture at time t, and st = st st1 its temporal derivative. st 0 denotes small change within tolerance margin ϵ, typically set to filter out noise. Let ft be the force magnitude (if available). We introduce three threshold parameters: τg (grasp threshold), τc (closure threshold), and τf (force threshold for contact detection). Manipulation processes can be represented as sequence of discrete phases, including approaching, stabilizing, contacting, releasing, and resetting or transitioning to subsequent actions. We denote the phase varible as Φ = {Φapp, Φstab, Φcont, Φrel, Φreset, Φtrans}. Each timestep is assigned label ϕt Φ according to the following temporal logic rules: 1:T , sGripper 1:T ϕt = Φapp Φstab Φcont Φrel Φreset Φtrans if st < τg st < ϵ if ϕt1 = Φapp st < τg st ϵ if ϕt1 = Φstab st τc st ϵ (ft > τf force unavailable) if ϕt1 = Φcont st τc st > ϵ if ϕt1 = Φrel st < τg st > ϵ otherwise The inclusion of force magnitude ensures that passive closure without external contact is not misclassified as active interaction. This multimodal phase labeling strategy captures both kinematic intent and physical contact, enabling robust segmentation of diverse manipulation behaviors. To enforce temporally coherent yet flexible phase progression, we define partial order over the manipulation phases: Φapp Φstab Φcont Φrel Φreset Φapp This structure enforces unidirectional transitions along the phase chain, while allowing both phase skipping (e.g., directly from Φapp to Φcont) and looping from the terminal phase Φreset back to the 4 Table 1: Categorization of visual reasoning questions for robotic manipulation, with manipulation phase (colorcoded) and data modality context.

These prototypes are organized into three reasoning categories. Spatial Reasoning focuses on the robots understanding of object geometry, reachability, and spatial layout across viewpoints. Questions such as Is the object reachable? or Whats the relative direction between the gripper and the object? are grounded in the early approach stages. These rely on RGB, depth, stereo, and 3D gripper pose data, which together enable accurate localization and spatial inference across frames or views. and stabilize Goal-conditioned Reasoning probes the agents high-level understanding of tasks, including goal inference, future action prediction, and overall task success. Questions such as Is the task failed?, What will the robot do next?, and What is the robots current action phase? span multiple manipulation phases from approach . These require temporal context, pose estimation, and sometimes motion history, leveraging the multi-step evolution of the scene. through reset Interaction Reasoning focuses on physical interaction dynamics, such as grasp stability or the robots current actuator state. These occur during stabilize phases, and depend on RGB, tactile, or gripper aperture signals.

We design the incorrect answers as part of the visual question prototypes. For example, in the scene understanding, we require the sampled points to be significantly different in depth from other points and from the depth sensor to account for sensor inaccuracy. In action understanding, the correct action arrow differs significantly from the distractor arrows by having large angular separation in the projected 2D image. To detect guessing by hallucination, we randomly replace some correct answers with \"None of Above\" option. 5 Figure 3: Distribution and key statistics of Robo2VLM-1 dataset.

The observation aligns the official technical report of Qwen2.5[2] that the mathematical and problem-solving capabilities of Qwen2.5-VL-32B are further enhanced through reinforcement learning. LLaMA models display different trend while the 11B model outperforms the 90B version in zero-shot setting, the larger model benefits more under CoT prompting, suggesting that scaling may unlock latent capabilities only when paired with explicit reasoning support. Effectiveness of CoT Prompting: CoT prompting generally enhances performance for both Qwen and LLaMA models. For example, Qwen 2.5 VL-7B improves from 30.63% to 34.82%, and LLaMA 3.2-90B increases from 28.60% to 30.45%. The most substantial gains are observed in Qwen 2.5 VL-32B, which improves from 37.68% to 41.30%. Results suggest that CoT benefits Task StateSuccess(from 55.08% to 60.43%), and Interaction Phase (from 63.80% to 71.35%). However, in the Spatial Relationship category, for example, Qwen 32Bs accuracy drops from 21.85% to 18.82%, indicating that verbose reasoning chains may introduce noise in tasks requiring precise spatial localization."

            "content": "We perform model finetuning experiment using Robo2VLM-1-train and evaluate on Robo2VLM-1test. We increase the training data samples from 10k to 50k in finetuning. As depicted in Figure 4, increasing the fine-tuning data generally leads to notable performance enhancements across most VQA categories. Significant gains are observed in Object State understanding, where accuracy improved from 29.34% to 80.24%. Task State-success also sees substantial rise from 47.65% to 68.03%. Other categories demonstrating clear positive trends with more data. However, in some categories such as Spatial Relationship and Task StateGoal, fine-tuning with limited data (e.g., 10k) underperforms the no-finetuning baseline. This may be because the model has not yet seen enough task-specific examples to begin generalizing, or because the question formats in Robo2VLM-1 differ from those seen during pretraining, requiring adaptation time. In some categories, finetuning with Robo2VLM-1 does not improve the performance due to the reasoning capability limitation of the base model. This is also reflected in the fact that LLaVA shows performance degradation in CoT prompting in Table 3. The interaction phase question requires the model to predict the next frame, 8 demanding complex reasoning and making it particularly challenging problem. This suggests that for complex tasks, the base model language performance is important for further improvement with Robo2VLM-1."

            "title": "5.3 Comparison with Human Performance",
            "content": "We conducted human evaluation covering all 11 categories defined in Table 3. For each category, human evaluator was asked to randomly answer questions from Robo2VLM-1-test. We use the average success rate as reference for comparison with three modelsLLaVA 1.6-7B, LLaVA 1.6-7B-Finetuned, and Qwen 2.5 VL32BCoT on the same set of categories as shown in Figure 5. Qwen 2.5 VL-32BCoT achieves near human accuracy, with 90.5% in Object State compared to 96.7% for humans, and 71.35% in Interaction Phase versus the human score of 80.0%. In more complex spatial reasoning tasks such as Spatial Relationship, where human achieves 60.0% accuracy, the best model (LLaVa 1.6-7B, finetuned) reaches only 19.42%. This may suggest that even if observing from multiple views, monocular image may lack the full depth information needed to accurately determine the spatial relationship. Furthermore, finetuning enhances model performance. LLaVA 1.6-7B finetuned on the Robo2VLM-1 training dataset shows consistent improvements across multiple categories, particularly in Task State, Object State, and Trajectory Understanding, compared to its non-finetuned LLaVA 1.6-7B. These findings demonstrate the potential Robo2VLM1 in studying and narrowing the gap between model and human performance in spatial and task reasoning.

            "title": "6 Conclusion and Discussion",
            "content": "In this paper, we introduce Robo2VLM, framework that generates VQA grounded in robot sensory modalities. We apply Robo2VLM to 176k real robot trajectories from Open X-Embodiment, and curate Robo2VLM-1, comprehensive dataset of 684,710 questions covering 463 distinct scenes, 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks, and 149 manipulation skills. Evaluation of state-of-the-art opensource VLMs suggests that some VLMs, such as Qwen2.5 VL 32B with CoT prompting, can achieve near human performance in questions related to object reachability and interaction understanding, while there is significant gap to human in reasoning fine-grained spatial relationship and interactions. Evaluation also suggests that finetuning Robo2VLM-1 dataset improves in spatial and interaction reasoning. Future work will focus on generalizing Robo2VLM to wider range of robot embodiments and generating an even more diverse dataset. We also plan to explore the deployment of models trained on Robo2VLM-1 to real-world robotic tasks. Limitation We acknowledge that Robo2VLM is data generation framework that relies on the quality of input tele-operated trajectories. If the original trajectory is wrongly calibrated, it compromises the quality of generated VQA data. Or if the original trajectory misses embodiment sensory modalities, such as NYU VINN [38] (0.2% of the 176k trajectories), it limits the amount of questions that Robo2VLM can generate."
