            "content": "V IDEO object segmentation (VOS) [1], [2], [3], [4] aims to segment specified target objects throughout the entire video. It is one of the most fundamental and challenging computer vision tasks, playing crucial role in various practical applications involving video analysis and understanding, e.g., autonomous vehicle, augmented reality, and video editing. There are different settings for VOS, for example, semi-supervised VOS [5], [6] that gives the first-frame mask, bounding box, or points of the target object, unsupervised VOS [7], [8] that automatically finds primary or salient objects, and interactive VOS [9], [10] that relies on the users interactions of the target object. VOS has been extensively studied in the past using traditional techniques [11], [12], [13] or deep learning methods [14], [15]. The deep-learningbased methods have greatly improved the VOS performance and surpassed the traditional techniques by large margin. Current state-of-the-art VOS methods [14], [15], [16] have achieved very high performance on two of the most commonlyused VOS datasets DAVIS [2], [3] and YouTube-VOS [4]. For example, XMem [16] achieves 92.0% & on DAVIS 2016 [2], 87.7% & on DAVIS 2017 [3], and 86.1% on YouTubeVOS [4]. With such high performance, it seems that the video Henghui Ding, Kaining Ying, and Yu-Gang Jiang are with Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

Xudong Jiang is with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Philip H.S. Torr is with University of Oxford, United Kingdom. Henghui Ding and Kaining Ying are co-first authors. object segmentation has been well resolved. However, do we really perceive objects in realistic scenarios? To answer this question, we introduced the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) dataset in [1], which revisits VOS under more realistic and complex scenes where traditional datasets fall short. In contrast to DAVIS [2], [3] and YouTubeVOS [4], where the target objects are typically salient and isolated, MOSEv1 focuses on challenging cases such as frequent object disappearance and reappearance, small or inconspicuous objects, heavy occlusions, and crowded environments. These real-world conditions significantly affect segmentation performance, with XMem only achieving 57.6% & on MOSEv1. Following its release in 2023, MOSEv1 has quickly attracted attention from the research community. We successfully organized several competitions based on this dataset, including PVUW [17], [18] and LSVOS [19], which have greatly promoted research in this field. series of strong VOS methods such as SAM2 [15] have pushed the performance from initial baselines to 76.4% & , highlighting both the difficulty and the value of the dataset while demonstrating substantial progress in handling complex scenes. In this work, building on the success and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, more challenging dataset that further pushes the boundaries of VOS in real-world environments. MOSEv2 significantly increases the complexity across multiple dimensions. Core challenges from MOSEv1, such as disappearancereappearance dynamics, small or occluded objects, and crowded scenes, are preserved but made more frequent, more challenging, and more realistic. Beyond that, MOSEv2 introduces range of new challenges rarely covered in previous datasets, including adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged ob5 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 0 3 6 5 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r MOSE DATASET PAGE: MOSE.VIDEO 2 Fig. 1: Example videos from the proposed MOSEv2 dataset. The selected target objects are masked in orange. The target object in case ① is enlarged for better visualization. The most notable features of MOSEv2 include both challenges inherited from MOSEv1 [1] such as disappearance-reappearance of objects (①-⑩), small/inconspicuous objects (①,③,⑥), heavy occlusions, and crowded scenarios (①,②), as well as newly introduced complexities including adverse weather conditions (⑥), low-light environments (⑤-⑦), multi-shots (⑧), camouflaged objects (⑤), non-physical objects like shadows (④), and knowledge dependency (⑨,⑩). The goal of MOSEv2 dataset is to provide platform that promotes the development of more comprehensive and robust video object segmentation algorithms. jects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), knowledgedependent scenarios, etc. These additions aim to bridge the gap between current VOS benchmarks and the diverse, unconstrained nature of real-world scenes. With these multifaceted complexities, the introduced MOSEv2 serves as next-generation benchmark to assess and drive progress in complex video object segmentation under realistic, dynamic, and highly unconstrained environments. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and 10,074 annotated object instances spanning 200 diverse categories, resulting in over 701,976 high-quality segmentation masks. Representative examples are shown in Fig. 1, illustrating the intensified and newly introduced challenges. common pattern is object disappearance and reappearance, as seen in the 3rd example where vehicle repeatedly disappears and reappears under overpasses, requiring robust temporal association. Challenges like small or inconspicuous objects, crowded scenes, and severe occlusions are also more prominent. For example, in the 1st example, tiny person moves through dense crowd, frequently occluded by others. Examples 4-10 highlight some new challenges in MOSEv2. Adverse weather (e.g., fog in the 6th), low-light conditions (e.g., underwater in the MOSE DATASET PAGE: MOSE.VIDEO 3 5th, nighttime in the 7th), and multi-shot sequences (e.g., 8th) introduce appearance instability, motion ambiguity, and temporal discontinuities. These demand strong generalization and longrange association. In addition, MOSEv2 includes novel object categories that are difficult for existing methods. For example, camouflaged objects (5th) blend into backgrounds, while nonphysical targets like shadows (4th) lack stable visual cues and change shape based on external factors. Besides, MOSEv2 further introduces knowledge-dependent scenarios (e.g., 9th and 10th examples) that require higher-level reasoning. For example, the 9th example requires optical character recognition to differentiate similar-looking blocks, while the 10th tests understanding of physics-based causality, as the target must be inferred from surrounding motion despite being invisible. These diverse and fine-grained challenges make MOSEv2 an ideal benchmark for evaluating and advancing the VOS robustness in open-world complex scenes. We believe MOSEv2 will drive meaningful progress in advancing video understanding toward real-world deployment. To thoroughly analyze the proposed MOSEv2 dataset, we retrain and benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under different settings. Experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of real-world videos in MOSEv2 significantly degrades the performance of current state-of-the-art VOS methods. For example, the & score of SAM2 [15] reaches 90.7% on DAVIS 2017 [3] and 76.4% on MOSEv1 [1], but notably drops to 50.9% on MOSEv2. Similarly, Cutie [14] achieves 87.9% on DAVIS 2017 and 69.9% on MOSEv1, but markedly declines to 43.9% on MOSEv2. These consistent performance drops highlight the significant challenges posed by the more realistic and complex scenarios in MOSEv2. Beyond VOS, MOSEv2 is applicable to wide range of video perception tasks that require fine-grained understanding in complex scenes. In particular, we evaluate its applicability for video object tracking (VOT) by benchmarking 9 state-of-the-art VOT methods [15], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27] on MOSEv2. While these methods perform well on standard VOT benchmarks such as LaSOT [28] and GOT-10k [29], we observe consistent and notable performance drop on MOSEv2, suggesting that MOSEv2 introduces new and significant challenges not only for VOS but also for VOT. This highlights the broader applicability of MOSEv2 as comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness and generalization capabilities of diverse video understanding algorithms under realistic and complex scenes. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: We present MOSEv2 (coMplex video Object SEgmentation), more challenging dataset for video object segmentation in complex scenes. Compared to MOSEv1, MOSEv2 includes not only more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, heavier occlusions, crowding, and smaller targets, but also introduces additional real-world complexities, such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot videos, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), and knowledge-dependent scenarios. We provide detailed comparative analysis between MOSEv2 and existing datasets, highlighting its unique challenges and greater complexity that better represents real-world video understanding scenarios. We conduct comprehensive benchmarks of state-of-the-art methods on MOSEv2 across various VOS and VOT task settings, including semi-supervised VOS with mask, box, and point initialization, as well as unsupervised VOS, interactive VOS, and video object tracking. We perform in-depth analysis of model performance and failure cases on MOSEv2, highlighting the key challenges posed by MOSEv2 and outlining potential directions for advancing robust video understanding in the wild."

            "title": "2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Video Object Segmentation",
            "content": "Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specific object throughout video. Based on how the target object is specified, VOS can be categorized into four main settings: 1) semisupervised VOS (also known as semi-automatic VOS [30] or oneshot VOS), 2) unsupervised VOS (also called automatic VOS or zero-shot VOS), 3) interactive VOS, and 4) referring VOS. Semi-supervised VOS. Semi-supervised VOS [5] aims to segment the target object throughout video, given its mask in the first frame. Most existing works can be categorized into propagation-based methods [4], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44] and matching-based methods [14], [16], [37], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55]. Propagation-based methods leverage the predicted mask from the previous frame to guide the segmentation of the current frame, thereby propagating object cues in frameby-frame manner. Matching-based methods, on the other hand, first encode the target object into an embedding space and then perform per-pixel classification by comparing the similarity between each pixels feature and the stored object embedding. Since obtaining pixel-level annotations is often expensive and timeconsuming, some methods employ bounding box as the first-frame reference [56], [57], [58]. For example, SiamMask [56] integrates mask prediction branch into fully convolutional Siamese object tracker to generate binary segmentation masks. Recently, SAM2 [15] adopts promptable visual segmentation (PVS), which allows the model to accept prompts in the form of positive/negative clicks, bounding boxes, or masks on any frame of video. This flexible interaction mechanism significantly improves the models adaptability and generalization across diverse scenarios. Following SAM2, several efficient extensions [25], [26], [27], [59] have been proposed to improve its performance. For example, SAM2Long [27] addresses error accumulation by exploring multiple segmentation pathways via constrained tree search. DAM4SAM [26] introduces distractor-aware memory and an introspection-based update strategy to mitigate ambiguity from visual distractors. To better handle dynamic scenes, recent works [25], [59] incorporate motion modeling into promptable segmentation. SAMURAI [25] integrates Kalman filtering [60] for adaptive memory selection, while MoSAM [59] enhances robustness through motion-aware sparse and dense prompts combined with spatiotemporal memory mechanisms. These SAM2 variant methods achieved impressive performance on the previous VOS datasets [1], [2], [3], [4], [15], [61], [62]. Interactive VOS. This task aims at segmenting the target object in video indicated by users interaction (e.g., clicks or scribbles) [9], [10], [37], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], it is special form of semi-supervised VOS. Existing methods mainly follow paradigm of interaction-propagation way. Besides the feature encoder that extracts pixel features, there are other two modules placed on the feature encoder to achieve interactive video object segmentation, i.e., interactive segmentation module that corrects prediction based MOSE DATASET PAGE: MOSE.VIDEO 4 on users interaction and mask propagation module that propagates user-corrected masks to other frames. SAM2 [15] has also demonstrated strong capabilities in this task, offering superior performance with flexible interaction mechanisms, significantly enhancing both segmentation quality and user experience. Referring VOS. Referring video object segmentation [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73] is an emerging setting that aims to segment the target object in video given text expression. Early methods can be broadly classified as bottom-up methods and topdown methods. Bottom-up methods [70], [74], [75] perform firstframe segmentation followed by mask propagation or per-frame segmentation with post-hoc association. Top-down methods [76], [77] first generate candidate tracklets and then select the one best aligned with the expression. The introduction of motion-centric datasets in MeViS [68] and MeViSv2 [69] has drawn increased attention to the importance of temporal dynamics for accurate language grounding. Subsequent works [78] highlight that temporal modeling is essential for accurate language grounding. Recent works [79], [80] also leverage multimodal large language models [81], [82] to handle expressions requiring complex reasoning, which enables human-like understanding and generalization ability across diverse language descriptions. With the latest datasets such as MeViSv2 [69] and OmniAVS [83] supporting expressions across multiple modalities, omnimodal referring VOS is expected to gain increasing attention in future research [84]. Unsupervised VOS. This setting requires no manual clues but aims to automatically segment the primary objects in video [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94]. However, it typically focuses on objects from set of pre-defined categories. Early methods relied heavily on post-processing techniques [85]. Then end-to-end training methods become the mainstream, which can be categorized into local content encoding and contextual content encoding paradigms. Local content encoding methods [7], [8], [91], [93], [95], [96], [97] often employ two-stream architectures to separately process optical flow and RGB information. Contextual content encoding methods [98], [99], [100] aim to capture long-range dependencies and global context. Recent methods have adapted propagation frameworks for this task, DEVA [101] proposes decoupled framework combining image-level segmentation with class-agnostic temporal propagation, eliminating the need for taskspecific video training data. EntitySAM [102] extends SAM2 for zero-shot video entity segmentation by automatically discovering and tracking all entities without explicit prompts."

            "content": "Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS). Driven by the success in image semantic segmentation [112], [113], [114] and large-scale video semantic segmentation datasets [115], [116], [117], video semantic segmentation has drawn lots of attention and achieved significant achievements. Compared to image domain, temporal consistency and model efficiency are the new efforts in the video domain. For example, Sun et al. [118], [119] propose Coarse-toFine Feature Mining to capture both static context and motional context. Syed Hesham et al. [120] propose state space modelbased [121] architecture for efficient temporal feature sharing. Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS). Kim et al. [122] introduce panoptic segmentation to the video domain to simultaneously segment and track both the foreground instance objects and background stuff. They also build Cityscapes-VPS dataset with 500 videos. Then, Miao et al. [123] build larger VPS dataset called VIPSeg with 3,536 videos. Existing methods [124], [125] mainly add temporal refinement or cross-frame association modules upon image panoptic segmentation models [126] to enhance temporal conformity and instance tracking performance. Li et al. [127] propose OMG-Seg, unified transformer-based model that supports video panoptic segmentation along with over ten other segmentation tasks via task-specific queries and outputs. Video Object Tracking (VOT). Different from VOS that focuses on pixel-level mask segmentation, VOT [128] aims to locate target object with bounding boxes in subsequent frames given its initial bounding box annotation. VOT has seen significant progress in recent years, with methods designed to handle challenging scenarios such as scale variations, occlusions, distractors, and complex backgrounds. The dominant approaches can be broadly categorized into Siamese-based methods [129], [130], [131] that learn discriminative feature embeddings through twin networks, and transformer-based methods [132], [133], [134], [135], [136] that leverage self-attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies for robust tracking. These methods have achieved impressive performance on existing VOT benchmarks like VOT [137], LaSOT [28], and GOT-10k [29]. The proposed MOSEv2 dataset also supports VOT task while introducing more complex real-world scenarios like dense crowds, occlusions, and frequent disappearance-reappearance that pose significant challenges to existing tracking methods."

            "title": "3.1 Video Collection and Annotation",
            "content": "Video Collection. The videos in MOSEv2 dataset are obtained from two sources. The first source is inherited from MOSEv1 [1] with 2,149 videos. The second source consists of newly selfcaptured videos from real-world scenarios and copyright-free videos from the internet that have not appeared in any existing dataset. MOSE is specifically designed for video object segmentation in complex scenes. To ensure the complexity and diversity of the collected videos, we follow set of strict selection rules: R1. Each video must contain several objects, while videos with only single object are excluded. Specifically, videos with crowded objects of similar appearance are highly valued. R2. Occlusions should be present in the video. Videos that do not have any occlusions throughout the frames are discarded. We encourage occlusions caused by other moving objects. R3. Great emphasis should be placed on scenarios where objects disappear and then reappear due to occlusions or out-of-view. R4. The target objects should encompass diverse range of scales (e.g., small-scale vs. large-scale) and visibility conditions (e.g., conspicuous, partially visible). R5. The video must exhibit clear motion, either from object movement or camera motion. Videos with static objects and stationary camera should be discarded. Besides the points mentioned above, we further emphasize the following rules in the design of MOSEv2: R6. Target object categories should be diversified, including novel classes not present in MOSEv1, such as camouflaged objects, shadows, and reflections. R7. Longer videos are preferred when they encompass more challenging patterns, such as long-term occlusions, complex motion dynamics, and repeated object disappearance and reappearance, rather than merely for their duration. R8. wide range of challenging environments are given priority during collection, such as low-light scenes, cluttered scenes, and varying weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, snow). R9. Multi-shot videos are encouraged, where objects undergo significant spatial or appearance changes across shots. R10. Videos requiring specific knowledge, such as optical character recognition, spatial reasoning, physical principles, and multi-view understanding are deliberately included. Video Annotation. Having all videos for MOSEv2 been collected, our research team looks through them and figure out set of targets-of-interest for each of the videos. Then we slightly clip the start and the end of videos, to reduce the number of less motional or simple frames in the video. Next we annotate the first-frame mask of the target objects, as VOS input. Following this, the videos are sent to the annotation team along with the first-frame masks for annotation of the subsequent video frames. Using the given first-frame mask as reference, the annotation team is required to identify the target object in the given firstframe mask, then track and annotate the segmentation mask of the target object in all frames following the first frame. The process of annotating videos has been made easier with the help of an interactive annotation tool that we developed. The annotation tool automatically loads videos and all target objects. Annotators use the tool to load and preview videos and first-frame masks, annotate and visualize the segmentation masks in the subsequent frames, and save them. The annotation tool also has built-in interactive object segmentation network SAM2 [15], to assist annotations in producing high-quality masks. To ensure the annotation quality under complex scenes, the annotators are required to clearly track and precisely segment the object. For frames in which the target object is disappeared or is fully occluded, annotators also need to confirm that the output masks of such frames shall be blank. It is requirement that all of our videos be annotated every five frames at the very least. For the purpose of testing the frame-rate robustness of the models, some videos are annotated every frame. After annotation, the videos are reviewed by our verification team to ensure high-quality video mask annotations."

MOSEv2 significantly surpasses its predecessor MOSEv1 regarding object disappearance and reappearance phenomena. The Disapp. Rate raise from 41.5% to 61.8%, while the Reapp. Rate more than doubles from 23.9% to 50.3%. This makes MOSEv2 the most challenging benchmark for evaluating disappearance-reappearance scenarios, surpassing all existing datasets. For example, its Disapp. Rate exceeds those of VOS datasets such as SA-V (58.7%), as well as VOT datasets like DiDi (40.0%). Similarly, its 50.3% Reapp. Rate outperforms LVOSv1 (46.7%) and SA-V (27.7%). Crowding. To assess crowding complexity, we compute the Distractors metric, which quantifies the average number of visually similar objects per target in the first frame using the state-of-theart object counting method T-Rex2 [161]. MOSEv2 significantly increases the distractor count to 13.6 per object, more than twice the 6.5 distractors in MOSEv1. In addition, MOSEv2 outperforms other benchmarks such as SA-V (6.2) and LVOSv2 (4.6). Notably, it even surpasses DiDi [26] (10.6), which is specifically designed to emphasize distractors in video object tracking, establishing MOSEv2 as the most challenging benchmark for evaluating segmentation robustness in densely crowded scenes. Occlusion. We compare the occlusion levels of MOSEv2 against other datasets in TABLE 2. While MOSEv2 achieves the highest mBOR score [111] of 28.3, this metric offers only coarse estimation of occlusion [1]. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), an object may be heavily occluded while still yielding BOR close to zero. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary metrics: Amodal-mask Occlusion Rate (AOR) and MLLM-assisted Occlusion Rate (MLLMOR), shown in Fig. 3 (b) and (c), respectively. AOR measures the ratio between visible and amodal mask areas, where amodal masks are generated by the amodal segmentation model DiffVAS [162]. MLLMOR leverages multimodal large language model (we use QWenVL-2.5-32B [163]) to assess ocTABLE 2: Comparison of the occlusion rate of different datasets."

We compute the final occlusion estimate as the average of all three metrics. As shown in TABLE 2, MOSEv2 achieves mean occlusion rate of 47.0 (mBOR: 28.3, mAOR: 54.8, mMLLMOR: 57.8), substantially exceeding MOSEv1 (36.4) and SA-V (36.1), establishing MOSEv2 as the most challenging benchmark for occlusion robustness evaluation. Mask Size. Fig. 4 compares the distribution of mask sizes (normalized by video resolution) across datasets. MOSEv2 contains substantially higher proportion of small masks (size < 0.01), reaching 50.2%, significantly above DAVIS (25.3%), YouTubeVOS (18.4%), LVOSv2 (34.8%), SA-V (40.7%), and MOSEv1 (39.5%). This high prevalence of small objects poses greater challenges for fine-grained perception and accurate segmentation.

Fig. 7: (Left) Distribution of instance sequences attributes. (Right) Attribute correlations in MOSEv2. Video Length. Fig. 5 presents the video length distribution in MOSEv2. Compared to only 11 videos exceeding 300 frames (around 1 minute) in MOSEv1, MOSEv2 introduces 183 such long videos, with the longest reaching 7,825 frames (around 26 minutes). The average video length increases from 60.6 to 93.2 frames, enabling more comprehensive evaluations of long-term temporal consistency and tracking robustness. While LVOSv2 [62] includes 362 videos over 300 frames with an average length of 590.9 frames, our 183 long videos average 598.4 frames and extend up to 7,825 frames, far beyond LVOSv2s maximum of 2,280. Importantly, video length alone does not imply difficulty. In MOSEv2, long videos are not included merely for their duration, but intentionally designed to include richer dynamics and more complex scenarios, such as object disappearance, occlusion, scene transitions, and multi-shot clips. For example, LVOSv2s reappearance rate is only 32.5%, substantially lower than our 50.3%, highlighting the increased complexity in MOSEv2. Complex Environments. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of challenging environmental conditions in MOSEv2. Compared to MOSEv1, we significantly expand the coverage of adverse scenarios. For example, rainy videos increased from 20 to 159, and underwater scenes from 29 to 280. MOSEv2 also introduces new conditions not present in MOSEv1, including 142 heavy rain, 73 snow, 60 fog, and 50 disaster scenarios (e.g., earthquake, flood). In total, MOSEv2 provides 443 cloudy, 159 rainy, 142 heavy rain, 73 snowy, 60 foggy, 280 underwater, 255 nighttime (vs. 75 in MOSEv1), and 50 disaster videos. This substantial expansion establishes MOSEv2 as more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating model robustness under diverse complex environments. Attribute Analysis. Following DAVIS [3], we define 15 instance sequence attributes of MOSEv2 in TABLE 3. As shown in Fig. 7 (left), MOSEv2 substantially expands the coverage of challenging scenarios compared to MOSEv1. For example, videos with occlusion (OCC) increase from 2,100 to 4,931, disappearancereappearance (DR) from 1,243 to 5,076, complex environments (CE) from 330 to 1,462, and long duration (LD) from 23 to 224. In addition, MOSEv2 introduces new attributes such as novel categories (NC, 609 instances), multi-shot sequences (MS, 277), and knowledge dependency (KD, 256). As visualized in Fig. 7 (right), we provide chord diagram showing the coTABLE 3: Definitions of sequences attributes in MOSEv2.

For small objects (e.g., chopstick with only 955 pixels), yields exaggerated scores due to fixed resolution-based thresholds, while offers more reliable measure by accounting for object scale. which represents how closely the contours of predicted masks resemble the contours of ground-truth masks. Then, the average region similarity 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 and contour accuracy 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 over all objects are calculated as the final results. For brevity, we use and to 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 and represent 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛, respectively. The overall performance is measured by & = ( + )2. Revisiting the Score. We observe that the standard score has limitations when evaluating small objects, which is particularly problematic for the proposed MOSEv2 dataset containing large number of small targets. Previous works [1], [2] adopt fixed boundary threshold 𝑤 = 0.008 𝐷 for images of the same resolution, regardless of object size, where 𝐷 is the length of image diagonal. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive boundary threshold: 𝑤 = min(0.008 𝐷, 𝛼 𝐴), (3) where 𝐴 is the objects area in pixels and 𝛼 is scaling factor. Based on analysis of boundary ratios in the DAVIS dataset, we set 𝛼 = 0.1 to maintain comparable boundary widths for averagesized objects while providing appropriate thresholds for smaller ones. We denote this modified, adaptive-threshold-based metric as , which offers fairer assessment of boundary accuracy across objects of varying sizes. As illustrated in Fig. 8, we analyze the boundary evaluation for both small and large objects in the same image. The predicted mask and ground truth for small object (e.g., chopstick, only 955 pixels) do not overlap. However, the widely used fixed threshold leads to excessive boundary dilation, resulting in an inflated score of 0.91, while the improved correctly assigns score of 0. For large object (e.g., person with maintains consistency with the previous evaluation. 38k pixels), Disappearance and Reappearance Metrics. Given the very frequent occurrence of object disappearance and reappearance in MOSEv2, we compute dedicated region similarity and contour accuracy scores: 𝑑 for disappearance clips where the target object is absent, and 𝑟 for reappearance clips where the target 𝑟, object reappears. We report the averaged scores & 𝑑 and & 𝑟 to represent overall performance in these respective scenarios. As shown in Fig. 9, we first compute these metrics per disappearance or reappearance clip, average them to obtain sequence-level scores. These metrics are designed to address limitations of standard and scores, which are computed over all frames in video and can be biased by the proportion of empty-target frames. For example, if video contains many disappearance frames, models that always predict empty masks may appear to perform well, even 𝑑, Fig. 9: Illustration of & , & 𝑟 computation. The slashed boxes denote frames with empty masks. Predicted masks are assumed to perfectly match the ground truth. 𝑑, and & if they fail to recover the target later. Conversely, in videos with few disappearance frames, models that consistently predict masks can achieve higher scores, as the penalty for incorrect predictions on empty-target frames becomes negligible. By isolating evaluation to the relevant clips, & 𝑑 and & 𝑟 offer clearer insights. Models that fail to suppress predictions during disappearances will score poorly on & 𝑑, while those unable to re-identify the object after its return will be penalized under & 𝑟. Only models that correctly handle both disappearance and reappearance can perform well on both metrics. Notably, for & 𝑟, we exclude the initial continuous presence of the target, where the reference information is strongest, and focus only on reappearance after disappearance, which better reflects the models ability to recover the target under ambiguity."

            "content": "Semi-supervised (or semi-automatic, one-shot) VOS offers the targets mask, bounding box, or points on the first frame as reference for segmenting the entire video. Mask-initialization. This is the most common and actively studied setting in VOS. As shown in TABLE 4, we benchmark two groups of mask-initialization semi-supervised VOS methods on our MOSEv2 dataset. The first group consists of traditional VOS methods, typically using ResNet-50 as their backbone. The second group comprises SAM2-based variants, including models of both SAM2-B+ and SAM2-L scales. Existing methods exhibit substantially lower performance on MOSEv2 compared to previous benchmarks such as DAVIS17 and YouTube-VOS19. For example, SAM2-B+ [15] achieves only 47.1% & on MOSEv2, which is notably lower than its performance of 74.7% & on MOSEv1, 83.1% & on LVOSv2, and 90.2% & on DAVIS17. Among traditional methods, Cutie [14] achieves the best performance with 42.8% & , only 3.2% behind SAM2-B+, benefiting from its effective instance-level modeling. However, its strong overall performance mainly comes from high & 𝑑 scores (64.5%) in handling disappearance, while struggling with reappearance as evidenced by much lower & 𝑟 score (18.3%), lagging SAM2-B+ by 4.9 points. Taking close look at the detailed metrics, we observe that all methods face significant challenges in reappearance scenarios, as indicated by the low & 𝑟 scores (ranging from 7.8% to 34.9%). This underscores the difficulty of re-identifying objects after they disappear and reappear in complex scenes. The adaptive boundary metric consistently shows lower scores than across all methods, demonstrating that the proposed adaptive boundary threshold provides more rigorous evaluation criterion that better reflects the quality of boundary predictions for objects of varying sizes. SAM2-based methods [15] demonstrate superior performance, even the zero-shot versions of SAM2 models outperform most finetuned traditional methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models on challenging video segmentation tasks. Moreover, all SAM2-based variants demonstrate enhanced performance on MOSEv2 compared to the base SAM2 model. These methods are specifically designed to address complex scenarios: SAMURAI [25] incorporates Kalman filtering for motion modeling to handle occlusions; DAM4SAM [26] introduces robust memory mechanisms to mitigate the influence of distractors in crowded scenes, and SAM2Long [27] employs memory tree to mitigate error accumulation in long videos with disappearance and reappearance. While these designs are tailored for specific challenges, such as occlusions and long-term tracking, these issues become significantly more severe in MOSEv2, and the existing methods still fall short in addressing them effectively. Furthermore, MOSEv2 presents new challenges, such as adverse environments, multi-shot transitions, and knowledge-dependent scenarios, which are not explicitly considered by current designs, leading to further performance degradation. For example, SAM2Long-L, which achieves the best overall performance among all methods, only reaches 51.5% & , indicating substantial room for improvement in addressing complex real-world scenarios. Notably, most SAM2 variants show decreased & 𝑑 but improved & 𝑟 scores, reflecting tendency towards more aggressive re-identification. Among these methods, SAMURAI achieves the highest & 𝑟 score but sacrifices the most in terms of & 𝑑, while SAM2Long strikes better balance and delivers the highest overall performance. The frequent disappearancereappearance patterns and diverse complex scenarios in MOSEv2 impose dual demands on both recall and precision. Future models must not only accurately suppress predictions when targets are absent, but also reliably re-identify them upon reappearance. Achieving strong performance thus requires effectively balancing these competing objectives, which remains crucial challenge. In terms of computational efficiency, there exists clear tradeoff between accuracy and speed. Traditional methods such as XMem [16] and STCN [166] offer faster inference speeds (49.8 and 45.1 FPS, respectively) but lower performance. In contrast, SAM2-based methods yield higher-quality results but at the cost of slower inference (e.g., 7.1 FPS for SAM2Long-L) and increased memory usage (6.8 GiB compared to 0.9 GiB for Cutie-B [14]).

We benchmark box-initialization semisupervised VOS methods on MOSEv2 validation set in TABLE 5. Similar to the mask-initialization setting, we evaluate both traditional (UniVS [170] and Cutie+SAM) and SAM2-based methods. The results show that SAM2-based methods significantly outperform traditional ones, with SAM2Long-L [27] achieving the best performance of 51.5% & . However, all methods struggle with reappearance scenarios evaluated by & 𝑟, while showing relatively better performance on disappearance cases, evaluated by & 𝑑. The performance gap between MOSEv2 and other benchmarks like DAVIS17 underscores the increase difficulty of the diverse and complex scenarios in MOSEv2. Point-initialization. As shown in TABLE 6, we benchmark point-initialization semi-supervised VOS methods on MOSEv2, including traditional methods (Cutie+SAM) and SAM2-based variants. The results show that SAM2-based methods significantly outperform traditional ones, with SAM2Long-L achieving the best performance of 48.5% & using only single click. Increasing the number of clicks from 1 to 5 does not consistently improve performance. Some methods even degrade with more clicks. This sensitivity to point initialization suggests that the ambiguity introduced by point prompts, combined with the complex scenes in MOSEv2, makes it challenging for models to maintain consistent segmentation even with additional user input. Compared to DAVIS17, where methods achieve much higher scores, e.g., 86.1% & for SAM2Long-L, the performance gap highlights the challenges posed by MOSEv2 in point-based settings.

To adapt MOSEv2 for VOT evaluation, we convert segmentation masks to bounding boxes by using the minimal enclosing rectangle. As shown in TABLE 10, we benchmark 9 state-of-the-art VOT methods on MOSEv2, including both traditional trackers and SAM2-based variants. Following LaSOT [28], we adopt P, Pnorm, and AUC as evaluation metrics. The results show that all methods undergo significant performance drop on MOSEv2 compared to existing VOT benchmarks. Among traditional trackers with Large scale, SUTrack-L [24] achieves the best performance with 27.8% AUC, while LORAT-L [23] performs the worst with only 25.5% AUC on MOSEv2. Overall, all traditional methods show relatively low performance, with scores ranging from 23.3% to 27.8% AUC. SAM2-based methods generally outperform traditional ones, with SAMURAI-L [25] achieving the highest AUC of 36.1%, followed by DAM4SAM-L (35.6%) and SAM2Long-L (33.1%). However, these results still show substantial gap compared to their performance on other benchmarks. For example, SAMURAI-L achieves 60.9% AUC on MOSEv1 [1], 74.2% on LaSOT [28], and 81.7% on GOT-10k [29], but only 36.1% on MOSEv2. Although SAMURAI lags behind other SAM2 variants like SAM2Long in VOS tasks, it shows superior tracking performance in the VOT setting. This can be attributed to two key factors.

            "content": "To better understand how different methods perform under specific challenges, TABLE 9 presents an attribute-based analysis on the validation set of MOSEv2. We evaluate mask-initialization semisupervised VOS methods across nine representative attributes defined in TABLE 3, including occlusion (OCC), disappearancereappearance (DR), crowding (CRO), diverse visibility (DV), complex environment (CE), novel categories (NC), long duration (LD), multi-shots (MS), and knowledge dependency (KD). The results reveal several key insights about model performance across different challenges. (i) SAM2Long [27] achieves the best overall performance with 42.9% & , consistent with its strong results in previous experiments. This suggests that robustness to MOSEv2s challenging scenarios translates into better general effectiveness. (ii) Fine-tuning significantly improves SAM2s performance, raising its & from 36.8% to 40.7%, which highlights the importance of adaptation to complex video scenarios. (iii) Traditional methods like Cutie [14] and XMem [16] excel in frames where objects are disappearing ( & 𝑑), with Cutie achieving the highest scores across most attributes (up to 81.8% for LD). However, they struggle significantly on reappearance scenarios ( & 𝑟), often failing to re-identify targets. For example, Cutie scores 81.8% & 𝑟 on LD videos, indicating tendency toward false negatives when objects reappear. (iv) comparison with LVOSv2 [62], which specifically focuses on long videos, highlights that the longduration sequences in MOSEv2 involve not only extended frame counts but also greater scene complexity. As shown in TABLE 11, LVOSv2 exhibits small Δ values, i.e., the gap between & 𝑑 and & 𝑟, indicating minimal difficulty in reappearance cases. 𝑑 but only 13.5% & MOSE DATASET PAGE: MOSE.VIDEO 12 In contrast, the LD subset of MOSEv2 shows much larger Δ values (+11.0 to +49.7), indicating severe reappearance difficulty. These challenges arise from frequent occlusions, camera shot transitions, background clutter, ambiguous reappearance cases, etc. For example, SAM2Long achieves 84.3% & on LVOSv2 but only 52.9% on MOSEv2s LD subset, underscoring the substantially more challenging nature of our dataset. (v) In knowledgedependent (KD) scenarios, all methods demonstrate significantly degraded performance, with Cutie [14] achieving only 30.5% & , underscoring the complexity of KD challenges. Traditional methods such as Cutie and XMem outperform SAM2 variants in KD scenarios, likely because they incorporate instance-level memory mechanisms that offer stronger semantic representation. SAM2 [15], is not pretrained on such scenarios and lacks heuristic design for knowledge-intensive tasks. Among SAM2-based methods, SAMURAI [25] performs best in KD scenarios (15.4% & 𝑟), possibly due to its Kalman filter-based motion modeling, which introduces spatial reasoning capabilities helpful for handling knowledge-based challenges. in contrast,"

            "content": "Fig. 10 presents eight challenging cases that reveal key limitations of existing VOS methods. 1) Models struggle with re-identifying objects after disappearance and occlusion. While SAM2Long [27], which maintains multiple segmentation paths, successfully tracks car undergoing simple linear motion (case a), it fails in more complex motion patterns such as person walking around crowd before reappearing (case b), indicating limitations in modeling long-term and nonlinear trajectories. 2) Densely crowded scenes containing small and heavily occluded targets (case c) remain extremely challenging, none of existing models succeed under such complexity. 3) In cases involving camouflaged objects or non-physical targets like shadows (cases and e), Cutie [14] outperforms SAM2 [15] and SAM2Long [27], especially in boundary quality. This advantage may stem from Cuties compact instancelevel memory, which explicitly models foreground objects and enables better separation from background distractions, while SAM2 relies on global image features lacking instance-specific cues. 4) Under adverse environmental conditions such as heavy snow (case f), the combination of low contrast and occlusion causes all models to fail, with Cutie producing inaccurate masks and SAM2 variants completely losing the target. 5) When faced with dramatic changes in viewpoint and object pose across multiple camera shots (case g), all models fail to maintain consistent tracking, as exemplified by the shifting appearance of Coke bottle. 6) In scenarios that require understanding physical object relationships and transformation rules (case h), such as tracking rotating Rubiks cube, the models fail to re-identify the correct block after disappearance, often incorrectly assigning it to adjacent blocks. These observations suggest several key directions for future research, including enhancing instance-level feature representations, improving cross-view and long-term consistency, and incorporating physical and spatial reasoning to better handle complex object dynamics in real-world videos."

            "content": "Robust Re-identification for Disappearance-Reappearance. The significant drop in & 𝑟 scores reveals key challenge in handling object disappearance-reappearance, especially when objects reappear with different viewpoints, deformations, or require specific knowledge for re-identification, e.g., Fig. 1⑩. While improving re-identification is essential for boosting & 𝑟, overly aggressive matching can harm & 𝑑 performance by producing false positives during disappearance periods. Future research should develop more adaptive re-identification strategies that integrate appearance cues, motion modeling, and high-level semantics to robustly handle complex disappearance-reappearance scenarios. Occlusion Handling. MOSEv2 presents frequent and complex occlusion scenarios, especially in crowded environments. Current methods often fail to maintain object representations under partial or full occlusions. Future work should explore occlusionaware architectures, including attention mechanisms sensitive to occluded regions, multi-scale feature fusion, and temporal models that preserve identity continuity through occlusion. Tracking in Crowded and Small-Target Scenarios. Small objects and crowded scenes frequently co-occur in MOSEv2, posing significant challenges for existing methods. Limited input resolutions (e.g., 480p in Cutie, 1024p in SAM2-B+) often result in the loss of fine-grained details, hindering accurate tracking of small targets. Future research should explore efficient strategies for high-resolution processing to better preserve spatial detail, as well as enhanced feature learning tailored to small objects. Promising directions include multi-scale architectures balancing detail and efficiency, attention mechanisms focused on small-object discrimination, and contrastive learning techniques to separate targets from visually similar distractors in crowded contexts. Generalization to Rare Categories. Although VOS methods are generally designed to be class-agnostic, achieving robust generalization to rare or unseen categories remains significant challenge. MOSEv2 includes 200 categories with pronounced long-tail distribution, featuring uncommon targets such as shadows and camouflaged objects. Despite their class-agnostic nature, current methods often fail to segment these rare categories effectively due to insufficient training data and inherent domain gaps. To address this, future research could investigate test-time adaptation techniques that exploit first-frame cues more effectively, or develop more robust instance-level representations that generalize better to uncommon and visually ambiguous objects. Environmental Robustness. MOSEv2 includes diverse adverse environments, such as rain, snow, fog, nighttime, and underwater conditions, which significantly degrade the performance of existing VOS methods. Under such conditions, object appearance becomes unreliable due to low visibility, while temporal consistency is often disrupted by illumination changes and environmental occlusions. Future research should explore adaptive enhancement techniques, such as weather-invariant feature extraction, illumination-robust representations, or synthetic data augmentation for adverse conditions. Incorporating auxiliary signals or learned priors from large-scale adverse-scene datasets, may further improve robustness in these real-world scenarios. Multi-Shot Video Handling. Existing methods heavily rely on appearance matching and position estimation under the assumption of temporal continuity. However, this assumption breaks down in multi-shot videos, where abrupt scene transitions can lead to dramatic changes in object appearance and position. Multi-shot structures are common in real-world content, especially in edited MOSE DATASET PAGE: MOSE.VIDEO 13 Fig. 10: Qualitative results on MOSEv2. We compare Cutie [14], SAM2 [15], and SAM2Long [27] on 8 challenging cases that assess model performance under various complex conditions. These include object disappearance and reappearance (a, b, e, g, h), small/inconspicuous objects (c), heavy occlusions (c, f), crowded scenes (c), adverse weather (f), low-light environments (a, d), multishot sequences (g), camouflaged targets (d), non-physical objects such as shadows (e), and knowledge-dependent scenarios (h). or narrative-driven videos. Future research should explore shotaware tracking strategies that can effectively handle discontinuities while maintaining object identity across discontinuous shots. Knowledge-Dependent Tracking. While existing methods have made notable progress in many VOS scenarios, they still struggle in cases requiring external knowledge such as OCR, spatial reasoning, or common sense understanding, as shown in TABLE 9. These challenges stem from the limited reasoning capabilities of MOSE DATASET PAGE: MOSE.VIDEO 14 current models, which primarily rely on appearance and positional cues. To address this limitation, future work may explore the integration of Multimodal Large Language Models [81], [82] to enhance semantic understanding and high-level reasoning. The key challenge lies in incorporating such models while maintaining computational efficiency and real-time performance. including adverse weather conditions,"
