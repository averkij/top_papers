            "title": "1 Introduction\nSpeech has become an increasingly important interaction modality\nfor information retrieval systems [15, 31]. From voice assistants in\nsmart home devices to in-vehicle infotainment systems [34], users\nare turning to spoken queries as a primary means of accessing\ninformation. Unlike clear text input, spoken queries in real-world\nscenarios are often affected by background noise, environmental\ninterference, and speaker variability. These factors degrade Auto-\nmatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance, and the resulting\ntranscription errors propagate to the retriever, often causing sub-\nstantial drops in retrieval effectiveness.",
            "content": "Although prior studies [18, 27, 28] have noted that ASR errors can negatively affect downstream tasks, existing evaluation practices remain highly fragmented. Speech-related work [21, 25, 37] primarily measures ASR robustness under noise using transcription-level metrics such as word error rate (WER), treating ASR as an isolated component. In contrast, information retrieval (IR) research [3, 29] evaluates models under the assumption that queries are clean and unambiguous text. As result, most IR benchmarks [19, 29] are constructed exclusively with text queries, while speech benchmarks [5, 20, 23] focus primarily on ASR performance rather than downstream retrieval performance. This mismatch makes it hard to compare spoken query retrieval systems under unified, controlled protocol, and it limits our understanding of system robustness under diverse acoustic conditions. Recent efforts have started to incorporate speech into benchmarkdriven evaluation. MSEB [11] has introduced retrieval-related subset with simple voice questions (SVQ) recorded under multiple environments. However, SVQ exhibits several limitations for robustness evaluation. First, its queries are primarily single-hop and fact-oriented, with relatively standardized question forms. Second, the associated corpora largely consist of short passages in general domains (e.g., Wikipedia), limiting contextual and task complexity. Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Li et al. Third, although recordings are collected under several environmental conditions, noise intensity is not explicitly controlled across graded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. To address these limitations, we introduce SQuTR, benchmark for spoken query to text retrieval under controlled acoustic noise. SQuTR provides (i) large-scale spoken-query dataset derived from text-based IR benchmarks and (ii) unified evaluation protocol that measures retrieval performance under multiple acoustic conditions. SQuTR constructs spoken queries from real queries in six widely used English and Chinese retrieval benchmarks: FiQA-2018 (finance) [7], HotpotQA (multi-hop QA) [41], Natural Questions (open-domain QA) [13], MedicalRetrieval (medical) [17], DuRetrieval (general-domain retrieval) [22], and T2Retrieval (passage retrieval) [39]. This design preserves realistic query complexity and broad task diversity beyond simple question templates. We synthesize speech using CosyVoice-3 [8] with 200 diverse speakers. To simulate diverse acoustic environments, we inject real-world environmental noise sampled from over dozen realworld categories, and construct four graded acoustic conditions (Clean, Low Noise, Medium Noise, and High Noise) by controlling the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This design enables controlled and reproducible analysis of retrieval robustness under graded acoustic perturbations. Our experiments systematically evaluate retrieval performance across different acoustic conditions, multiple ASR front-ends, and both lexical and dense retrievers. We observe consistent decline in retrieval effectiveness as acoustic noise increases, and this degradation pattern remains stable across ASR models of varying sizes and architectures. These findings underscore robustness as key challenge for practical spoken query to text retrieval.

            "content": "Recent efforts have started to incorporate speech into benchmarkdriven evaluation. Massive Sound Embedding Benchmark (MSEB) introduces Simple Voice Questions (SVQ), large collection of short spoken queries recorded under multiple environments [11]. While MSEB provides valuable coverage for evaluating general auditory representations, SVQ is built around simplified queries and acoustic conditions defined by recording environments rather than explicitly controlled and graded perturbations. Consequently, it does not provide an IR-aligned, end-to-end robustness benchmark for spoken query to text retrieval under increasing acoustic stress. SQuTR fills this gap by extending established IR benchmarks to spoken queries with preserved corpora and relevance judgments, together with controlled, graded acoustic conditions."

Babble noise from NOISEX-92 [32] is additionally included. These noise sources are applied at predefined signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) levels to construct the Low, Medium, and High Noise conditions. We further summarize the noise-type distribution in Section 3.5 (Figure 2). Additive noise is applied using global RMS-based scaling procedure to achieve the target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Given clean speech 𝑥 [𝑛] and noise signal 𝑑 [𝑛], the noisy signal is constructed as 𝑦 [𝑛] = 𝑥 [𝑛] + 𝛼 𝑑 [𝑛] (1) where the scaling factor 𝛼 is computed based on the root mean square (RMS) energy of the speech and noise signals: 𝛼 = RMS(𝑥) RMS(𝑑) 10 SNRdB 20 (2) RMS energy is computed after trimming leading and trailing silence to ensure that the specified SNR reflects the active speech content.

To assess performance, we utilize standard information retrieval metrics based on existing relevance judgments. We adopt nDCG@10 as the primary metric to evaluate both the presence and ranking position of relevant documents. Complementary metrics include Recall@k, which measures the coverage of relevant documents, and MRR@k, which assesses the capability to retrieve the first relevant result early.

We also observe that spoken-query retrieval underperforms the text upper bound even in clean conditions, and the gap widens with noise. For example, Qwen3-Embedding-8B (Chinese) drops from 0.8033 on Text to 0.7760 on Clean Speech. This gap is consistent with error propagation in cascaded systems (ASR errors affecting downstream retrieval) and the inherent difficulty of aligning speech and text representations in end-to-end models. Finally, SQuTR remains challenging testbed. Even the strongest model, Qwen3-Embedding-8B, does not match text performance under noise (0.7302 at High Noise vs. 0.8033 on Text), and end-to-end models still lag behind strong cascaded baselines, leaving substantial headroom for improving noise-robust spoken query retrieval."

Second, model scaling and direct modality modeling improve robustness. Within the Qwen3 series, increasing model size from 0.6B to 8B reduces variance (𝜎 : 0.094 0.070) while improving mean effectiveness. The end-to-end model Omni-Embed-Nemotron-3B (𝜎 = 0.054) further narrows this gap, suggesting that larger capacity and direct speech-to-embedding mapping mitigate instability."

Since modern ASR models saturate at 20dB (treating it effectively as clean), random variations in error patterns (e.g., hallucinations vs. deletions) can occasionally favor exact keyword matching.

            "content": "To ensure the reproducibility of the SQuTR acoustic environment, we formally define the signal degradation process based on global energy statistics. The distorted signal 𝑦 [𝑛] is modeled as linear superposition of the reverberant speech and additive noise: 𝑦 [𝑛] = (𝑥 ℎ) [𝑛] + 𝛼 𝑑 [𝑛] (3) where 𝑛 is the discrete time index. 𝑥 [𝑛] represents the clean speech synthesized by CosyVoice-3. Prior to processing, all audio components are strictly resampled to unified rate of 24kHz to prevent spectral aliasing. The convolution (𝑥 ℎ) [𝑛] incorporates room acoustics via the Room Impulse Response (RIR) ℎ[𝑛]. We define the target signal 𝑠 [𝑛] = (𝑥 ℎ) [𝑛] as the holistic reverberant speech. To ensure the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) accurately reflects the active speech level, standard leading and trailing silence trimming is applied to 𝑥 [𝑛] before energy calculation. The additive noise sequence 𝑑 [𝑛] is randomly sampled from the DEMAND/NOISEX-92 datasets. The scaling factor 𝛼 is derived from the global Root Mean Square (RMS) amplitude: RMS(𝑠) = (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:116) 1 𝑁 𝑁 1 𝑛=0 𝑠 [𝑛]2, RMS(𝑑) = (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:116) 1 𝑁 𝑁 1 𝑛=0 𝑑 [𝑛]2 (4) where 𝑁 denotes the signal length. Given target SNRdB, the mixing coefficient 𝛼 is solved as: 𝛼 = RMS(𝑠) RMS(𝑑) 10 SNRdB (5) Finally, the mixed signal 𝑦 [𝑛] is globally normalized to fit within the standard PCM dynamic range, utilizing headroom factor 𝛽 = 0.9 to prevent digital clipping. Automated Quality Control Protocol To ensure the semantic integrity of the dataset, we define rigorous filtering function Φ : {0, 1} that maps generated audio sample 𝑥 to binary acceptance decision. The process involves cascade of objective metrics and subjective proxy evaluations. The filtering pipeline, formally described in Algorithm 1 (Figure 4), integrates two distinct verification stages: (1) Objective Consistency Check: We utilize large-scale ASR model (M𝐴𝑆𝑅) to verify if the synthesized speech 𝑎𝑖 aligns with the ground-truth text 𝑡𝑖 . To mitigate minor formatting discrepancies, normalization function () (lowercasing, punctuation removal) is applied before computing the Word Error Rate (WER). (2) Subjective Proxy Evaluation: We employ \"Judge-LLM\" paradigm utilizing two distinct Large Language Models, M𝐺𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖 and M𝐺𝑃𝑇 , as independent evaluators. They score the audio quality 𝑄 [1, 5] based on Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. To ensure full reproducibility, we strictly controlled the computational environment, inference hyperparameters, and model-specific configurations.

Input Preprocessing. Although the SQuTR dataset is mastered at sampling rate of 24kHz to preserve high-frequency acoustic details (as detailed in Appendix A), most pre-trained ASR systems are optimized for 16kHz input. To prevent spectral aliasing and timescale modification artifacts during inference, we applied SQuTR: Robustness Benchmark for Spoken Query to Text Retrieval under Acoustic Noise Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY on-the-fly downsampling to 16kHz for all ASR models using torchaudio (Lanczos resampling kernel). [SYSTEM INSTRUCTION] Model Configurations. We evaluated the following systems: English (Whisper Family): We utilized OpenAIs whisper series: Tiny (39M): openai/whisper-tiny Base (74M): openai/whisper-base Small (244M): openai/whisper-small Medium (769M): openai/whisper-medium Chinese: We adopted Paraformer. Paraformer-Large: funasr/paraformer-large Role: You are an expert Audio Forensic Analyst and Linguistic Quality Specialist. Task: You will be provided with Reference Text and an Audio Clip. Your goal is to evaluate the audios fidelity and quality with extreme rigor. Evaluation Protocol (Step-by-Step): (1) Listen & Transcribe: Mentally transcribe the audio. Compare it strictly against the Reference Text. (2) Check for Fatal Errors: Truncation: Is the start or end of the sentence cut off? Hallucination: Does the audio contain words not in the text? Omission: Are any words skipped? (3) Assess Signal Quality: Detect background static, metallic robotic artifacts, or unnatural pitch shifts. Multilingual Baselines: To assess cross-lingual robustness, Scoring Rubric (Strict): we also included: SenseVoice-Small: FunAudioLLM/SenseVoiceSmall Whisper-Large-v3: openai/whisper-large-v3 GLM-ASR-Nano-2512: zai-org/GLM-ASR-Nano-2512 Fun-ASR-Nano-2512: FunAudioLLM/Fun-ASR-Nano-2512 Qwen3-ASR-1.7B: Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B For all ASR inference, we used deterministic greedy decoding with forced language token to prevent identification errors. B.3 Retrieval Model Configuration We evaluated 15 distinct cascaded retrieval architectures. Modern embedding models often require specific **task instructions** (prefixes) to activate their asymmetric retrieval capabilities. We strictly adhered to the official prompt templates as detailed in Table 9. Table 9: Model-specific query instructions (Prefixes) for all embedding models. Model Family Query Instruction / Prompt Lexical BM25 BGE Series v1.5 BGE-M3 N/A (𝑘1 = 0.9, 𝑏 = 0.4) \"Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages:\" N/A (Dense vector-only mode) Multilingual-E5-Large \"query: \" EmbeddingGemma-300M \"task: search result query: \" All-MiniLM-L6-v2 Stella-EN-400M-v5 Qwen3 Embedding Series N/A \"Instruct: Given web search query, retrieve relevant passages that answer the query. Query:\" \"Given web search query, retrieve relevant passages that answer the query\" Omni-Embed-Nemotron3B N/A B.4 Evaluation Metrics Standard We report the normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at rank 10 (nDCG@10). The implementation strictly follows the NIST trec_eval standard. Relevance Mapping: For datasets with graded relevance (e.g., FiQA), we preserve original grades. For binary datasets (e.g., NQ), relevance is mapped to {0, 1}. Global Ranking: For multi-GPU inference, embeddings were gathered across devices to ensure accurate global ranking statistics. 5.0 (Perfect): Indistinguishable from human recording. 100% text match. Zero noise. 4.0 (Good): Clear and correct. Slight digital \"flavor\" but fully intelligible. 3.0 (Acceptable): Noticeable noise or slight mispronunciation, but meaning is preserved. 2.0 (Bad): Hard to understand. Significant artifacts. Missing 1-2 noncritical words. 1.0 (Critical Failure): Wrong text, severe truncation, or pure noise. Constraint Checklist: Do NOT be lenient. Be critical of minor glitches. If the audio is truncated (incomplete sentence), the max score is 2.0. Output MUST be valid JSON.

The prompt includes explicit failure mode definitions and specific handling for TTS edge cases (e.g., truncation). Robust Evaluation Prompts To ensure the validity and consistency of our \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" pipeline, we developed sophisticated prompt template incorporating Role-Playing, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and Negative Constraints. The prompt explicitly enforces an \"Audio Forensic Analyst\" persona to minimize hallucination. The JSON output schema is strictly defined to ensure parsing reliability.
