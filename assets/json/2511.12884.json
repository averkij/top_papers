            "content": "The hottest new programming language is English. Andrej Karpathy (Founding member of OpenAI) Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software development from editing code by hand to instructing Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents in natural language [26, 33]. This novel approach, termed Agentic Coding, interprets natural language goals, decomposes them into subtasks, and autonomously plans and writes code with minimal human intervention. However, the autonomy of these agents hinges on critical, often overlooked factor: context. For an agent to work for software project, adhere to architectural patterns, and follow team conventions, it requires not only access to source code but also explicit guidance. The effectiveness and safety of this workflow depend not only on model quality but also on how projects communicate their architecture, constraints, and conventions to these agents. To address this, new class of software artifact has emerged: agent context files. These are specialized files (e.g., AGENTS.md) that work like README for agents1 and define how the agent should behave within given software project. These documents specify project-specific knowledge, architectural overviews, build and test commands, coding conventions, and explicit rules for interacting with tools and external services. They define the agents role, describe the system architecture, record build and test commands, and encode coding standards and operational rules. Modern coding tools such as Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot load these files at the start of session and use them as persistent context when planning and executing changes. In practice, the quality of these agent context files largely determines how well an agent can understand repository, follow team practices, and perform non-trivial maintenance tasks. Prior work on LLM-assisted software engineering has focused on model capabilities, interaction patterns, and immediate prompts, for example, code generation [24, 29], automatic program repair [10, 71, 78], and multi-agent collaboration [76]. Researchers have also begun to study context engineering [24, 57] and prompt management in software repositories [32, 58]. However, the concrete artifacts that teams are already using in the wild to steer coding agents (namely agent context files) remain underexplored. Official tool documentation gives only high-level guidance (e.g., describe architecture and workflows), leaving developers to design these manifests by trial and error. We currently lack basic empirical evidence about what these files look like, how they evolve over time, and what instructions they actually contain. To bridge this gap, we conduct large-scale empirical study of agent context files. Building on our prior work [13] which studied 253 context files for Claude Code, we extend the scope to 2,303 context files from 1,925 repositories across three agentic coding tools: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot. We aim to uncover the structural patterns, maintenance habits, and instructional strategies that developers currently employ. Our study focuses on these research questions (RQs): 𝑅𝑄1: What are the characteristics of agent context files? Understanding readability and structure is essential for creating maintainable agent configurations. Agent context files are generally long and difficult to read, yet follow consistent shallow hierarchy with single top-level heading and most content organized under H2 and H3 sections. 1https://agents.md , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2025. Agent READMEs: An Empirical Study of Context Files for Agentic Coding 3 𝑅𝑄2: How often do developers maintain agent context files? It is unclear whether agent context files behave like static documentation or like evolving configuration in the codebase. Agent context files are actively maintained in short bursts, evolving through incremental additions rather than deletions, behaving as living configuration artifacts rather than static documents. 𝑅𝑄3: What instructions are included in agent context files? Identifying what context developers prioritize reveals the current focus and blind spots of agentic coding in real-world projects. Instructions are heavily skewed toward functional operations (e.g., Build and Run, Implementation Details), while critical non-functional requirements like Security and Performance are rare. 𝑅𝑄4: To what extent can instructions in agent context files be classified automatically? Manual analysis of agent context files content is unscalable, making it critical to understand if this classification can be automated for future monitoring. Automatic classification is highly effective (0.79 F1-score) for concrete functional topics (e.g., Testing and Architecture), but it struggles with abstract or nuanced topics (e.g., Maintenance).

            "content": "The structure and content of agent context files vary significantly across projects, reflecting diverse development needs and practices. Consider two real-world examples that illustrate this diversity. web framework project (shown in Figure 1) contains minimal AGENTS.md file of just 20 lines with 3 sections, providing basic instructions about running commands, code style, and directory structure. In contrast, an agent-tool development project could feature comprehensive 329-line file with 74 distinct sections, covering project overview, architecture, development workflow, security and performance considerations, testing strategy, etc.3 These examples demonstrate that agent context files are not standardized or template documents but rather adaptable configuration mechanisms that developers customize based on project complexity, team size, and domain-specific requirements. Despite their importance, official documentation for agent context files remains limited. For example, the official documents of Claude Code indicate only that agent context files can be used to share instructions for the project, such as project architecture, coding standards, and common 2https://github.com/woraamy/Agent-Context-File-Analysis 3https://github.com/antimetal/system-agent/blob/3552a87720e0e16a9c05681b1e549c9a73921ade/CLAUDE.md , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

This fragmentation and lack of explicit, standardized guidance can delay developers ability to effectively define and leverage the agents behavior, creating substantial barrier to exploiting the full potential of agentic coding and potentially leading to inconsistencies in agent performance and steeper learning curve for integration. Consequently, this gap in practical guidance for the creation of agent context files served as primary motivation for our current research. We aim to address this challenge by systematically investigating existing Claude Code files within open-source repositories. Our study is specifically designed to infer common structural patterns, typical instructions, and general practices in how developers configure and maintain these crucial agent context files files."

            "content": "4.1 𝑅𝑄1: What are the characteristics of agent context files? 4.1.1 Motivation. Agent context files serve as the initial instructions an agent reads before execution. Understanding their characteristics (such as size, readability, and organizational structure) in real-world projects is crucial for helping developers write effective agent context files. These attributes, much like in traditional software artifacts, directly impact usability, maintainability, and clarity. For instance, context file size and the amount of context provided can correlate with task performance and computational cost [34]. Readability is also critical: instructions that are hard to read can be misunderstood by agents or incorrectly modified by developers, leading to unintended behavior [46]. For example, higher readability has been associated with better outcomes in issue resolution tasks [14]. Prior work on traditional software documentation shows that developer-focused documents typically employ hierarchical section structures [65]. Empirical studies of project documentation (e.g., README files) also find that early versions tend to be minimal, focusing on basic usage [21]. However, agent context files such as CLAUDE.md are new class of documentation designed specifically for coding agents. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has systematically analyzed the structural characteristics of agent context files (e.g., how many levels of instructions they contain). We therefore investigate not only their size and readability, but also their organizational patterns."

This yields the depth and distribution of sections within these agent context files. To identify statistically significant differences across coding agents, we perform the MannWhitney test [36] at significance level of 𝛼 = 0.05. We compute Cliffs delta 𝑑 [35] effect size to quantify the difference based on the following thresholds [52]: Effect size = 𝑛𝑒𝑔𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒, 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑙, 𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑢𝑚, 𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒, if 𝑑 0.147 if 0.147 < 𝑑 0.33 if 0.33 < 𝑑 0.474 if 0.474 < 𝑑 1 (1) Findings. Agent context files for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot are substantially 4.1.3 longer than those for OpenAI Codex. As illustrated in Figure 3a, context files for GitHub Copilot (median 535.0 words) and Claude Code (median 485.0 words) are similarly extensive, with no statistically significant difference in length. However, both are significantly longer than OpenAI Codex context files (median 335.5 words), difference confirmed to be statistically significant with small effect size (Cliffs delta 𝑑 = 0.21 and 𝑑 = 0.22, respectively).

Distribution of agent context filess Headers suggests that developers using Claude Code and GitHub Copilot may incur higher computational costs or token penalties. Agent context files are generally difficult to read, with Claude Code the hardest and OpenAI Codex the easiest. Figure 3b shows that Claude Code context files are the most difficult to read, with median FRE score of 16.6. This places them in the very difficult category, typical of dense academic or legal documents (see Table 2). GitHub Copilot context files, while also very difficult (median FRE 26.6) to read, are nonetheless significantly easier to read than Claude Codes with small effect size (𝑑 = 0.24). OpenAI Codex context files are the easiest to read of the group, with median FRE score of 39.6 (difficult), which is significantly easier to read than both Claude Codes (medium effect size) and GitHub Copilots (small effect size). Agent context files follow consistent, shallow hierarchy centered on single top-level heading with most structure at H2 and H3. Figure 4 shows that the structure is almost always single, top-level H1 heading, with median count of 1.0 for all context files (with no statistically significant difference), suggesting developers treat each file as unified document. From this primary heading, the context files branch into moderate number of H2 headings (median 6 to 7) to define major topics. While all context files follow this pattern, GitHub Copilot and Claude Code context files provide significantly more granular detail through greater number of H3 and H4 sub-sections compared to OpenAI Codex. For example, at the H3 level, GitHub Copilot (median 12.0) and Claude Code (median 11.0) are significantly more detailed than OpenAI Codex (median 9.0), with these differences being statistically significant with small effect size (𝑑 = 0.15 and 𝑑 = 0.17, respectively). Deeper levels are uncommon. At the H4 level, Claude Code (median 5.0) is also statistically significantly more granular than GitHub Copilot (median 4.0), though the effect size remains small (𝑑 = 0.17). Despite these differences in granularity, the preference for shallow hierarchy is universal. Deeply nested structures (H5 and beyond) are extremely rare. For example, H5 headers appear in only 6 Claude Code files and H6 headers are non-existent, with no significant difference in their infrequent use. This common structural template: single H1, several H2s, and some H3s or H4s, likely makes the context files easier for developers to quickly parse, modify, and maintain. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

Claude Code and GitHub Copilot context files are significantly longer than OpenAI Codex, with Claude Code being the hardest to read and OpenAI Codex the easiest. Structurally, they follow consistent, shallow hierarchy, typically centered on single H1 heading with content organized primarily under H2 and H3 sub-sections. 4.2 𝑅𝑄2: How often do developers maintain agent context files? 4.2.1 Motivation. Prior empirical studies consistently show that traditional software documentation (e.g., README files) is maintained far less actively than source code [19, 21]. Such documentation is often created early in projects lifecycle and then receives only minor or infrequent updates, often limited to formatting or link corrections [18]. However, prior work has focused on general-purpose documentation written for humans. Agent context files such as CLAUDE.md serve different purpose: they function as operational configurations for AI coding agents and directly influence how these agents behave in the development workflow. It is unclear whether developers treat them like traditional documentation or as live configuration artifacts that evolve alongside the code. This RQ investigates how often developers modify these context files and how intensive that maintenance is over time, to determine whether they exhibit the same maintenance inertia as traditional documentation or follow more active and dynamic evolution."

Figure 5a shows that majority of Claude Code context files (67.4%) are modified in multiple commits, indicating that they are routinely revisited and refined rather than being written once and forgotten. This pattern also holds, though slightly less frequent, for GitHub Copilot (59.7%) and OpenAI Codex (59.2%). The results of Mann-Whitney test show that Claude Code context files receive significantly more commits than both GitHub Copilot (with medium effect size where 𝑑 = 0.35) and OpenAI Codex (with small effect size where 𝑑 = 0.15). In addition, OpenAI Codex context files are updated more often than GitHub Copilot with small effect size (𝑑 = 0.18). Overall, agent context files behave as evolving configuration artifacts and not as static instructions. Maintainers update agent context files in short bursts. Figure 5b shows that the median interval is 70.7 hours (around 3 days) for GitHub Copilot, 24.1 hours (around 1 day) for Claude Code, and 22.0 hours (around 1 day) for OpenAI Codex.

In contrast, comparisons involving the general agents dataset show small effect sizes against both GitHub Copilot (𝑑 = 0.21) and Claude Code (𝑑 = 0.17). Manifest evolution is driven by small, incremental additions, while deletions are minimal. Figure 6 show that deletions are consistently negligible across all context file types, with median values less than 15.0 words. In contrast, additions are more substantial and variable.

Agent context files are are actively maintained and majority (59% to 67%) are modified in multiple commits, with Claude Code files receiving significantly more commits than others. Maintenance typically occurs in short bursts, with updates often performed about day apart, and evolution is driven mainly by small incremental additions rather than large-scale deletions or rewrites. 4.3 𝑅𝑄3: What instructions are included in agent context files? 4.3.1 Motivation. Prior work shows that clear, structured instructions, such as stepwise task descriptions or templated formats, significantly improve LLM-generated outputs [75], with performance fundamentally shaped by the contextual information provided [39]. Despite this, there is little empirical research on agent context files intended to configure and guide AI agents. RQ2 addresses this by identifying prevalent instruction patterns in these manifests, revealing how developers structure context to align AI behavior in practice."

This separation was necessary due to the\nextensive structure and diversity of instructional content in Claude Code, which made simultaneous\nlabel generation and assignment impractical.",
            "content": "In the first phase, we focused on constructing robust and comprehensive label set. We began by extracting all the H1 and H2 titles from the Claude Code files. Subsequently, we prompted three popular large language models (LLMs), Claude Opus 4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT-5, to generate candidate labels. One of the authors then selected the most appropriate label from these suggestions or created new label when none were suitable. The use of LLMs was motivated by findings from prior research [5], which demonstrated that recent LLMs perform comparably to human annotators in manual labeling tasks while significantly reducing effort. To ensure label quality, two authors independently reviewed the initial label set. This process yielded 80 distinct labels. In the final step, three inspectors collaboratively refined the label set by merging semantically similar entries, resulting in consolidated set of 16 core labels. In the second phase, two inspectors assigned the labels generated in the first phase to each Claude Code file, allowing multiple labels per file. Initially, both inspectors independently labeled the content of each file. This process resulted in 2,227 total label assignments across the 332 files, with 438 instances of disagreement (80.3% of agreement rate). To resolve these conflicts, third inspector joined the discussion and collaborated with the initial two to reach consensus on the final labels. This conciliation process results in total of 2,069 labels. All three inspectors involved in the labeling process have programming experience ranging from 4 to 17 years. Findings. The manual classification process identified 16 distinct categories of agent 4.3.3 context files. Table 3 presents the distribution of documentation categories, where percentages indicate the proportion of Claude Code files containing instructions for each category. We identified 16 distinct labels, including two new categories (Maintenance and Debugging) beyond those in our previous work [13]. These additions were necessary to classify cases that did not fit existing categories. When looking into the table, the most prevalent was Build and Run (62.3%), containing command-line instructions, scripts, and procedures for compiling and running code. This was followed by Implementation Details (69.9%) with development guidance (e.g., code style) and Architecture (67.7%) describing high-level system design. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2025. Agent READMEs: An Empirical Study of Context Files for Agentic Coding 11 Table 3. Categories, descriptions, and their prevalence in agent context files (ACFs).

This pattern suggests that manifests are primarily optimized to help agents execute and maintain code efficiently rather than address broader quality attributes or user-facing aspects. Beyond functional factors, we observed notable instances where developers provide contextual information. For example, half of the Claude Code files contain system overview explanations (i.e., System Overview). Additionally, 24.4% of manifests (i.e., AI Integration label) explicitly define the agents role and describe its responsibilities within the project (e.g., reviewers). This indicates that manifests serve not only as technical guides but also as means of establishing an AI agents understanding, responsibilities, and collaborative alignment. Below, we describe each category in detail and introduce representative example. System Overview. These instructions provide general project or system overview and describe key features. We observed these instructions in 59.0% of files. Listing 1 shows an example.5 This example describes the projects identity, mechanism, and functionality. Listing 1. Example Instruction for Project Overview 1 ## Project Overview 2 Brightroom is composable image editor library for iOS, 5https://github.com/FluidGroup/Brightroom/blob/main/CLAUDE.md , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

You specialize in helping with the Craft Code Club website and blog platform, providing guidance on development, content management, SEO optimization, and performance tuning for this software engineering community. Documentation. This instruction type lists supplementary documents, links, or references for additional context. We observed these instructions in 26.8% of files. Listing 3 shows an example.7 This example provides specific documentation requirements: adding inline comments to explain non-obvious code, including JSDoc comments for public APIs, documenting complex types with examples, and providing usage examples in hook file comments. Additionally, Listing 4 demonstrates how to document updates to the Agentic Coding Manifest itself, instructing AI agents to update the file whenever they learn new project information that future tasks might need, noting that keeping guidelines current helps everyone work more effectively.8 Listing 3. Example Instruction for Documentation 1 ### Documentation Requirements 2 - Complex Logic: Add inline comments explaining non-obvious code 3 - Public APIs: Include JSDoc comments for exported functions 4 - Type Definitions: Document complex types with examples 5 - Hook Usage: Provide usage examples in hook file comments Listing 4.

Keeping the guidelines current helps everyone work more effectively. Architecture. This instruction type describes the high-level structure, design principles, or key components of the systems architecture. We observed these instructions in 67.7% of files. Listing 5 shows an example.9 This example provides architectural structure, defining the project as pnpm workspace with several packages under src/. It details the roles of packages like core (shared 6https://github.com/craft-code-club/blog-c3/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md 7https://github.com/skip-mev/skip-go/blob/main/AGENTS.md 8https://github.com/zoonk/zoonk/blob/main/AGENTS.md 9https://github.com/puemos/hls-downloader/blob/master/AGENTS.md , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2025. Agent READMEs: An Empirical Study of Context Files for Agentic Coding 13 business logic in TypeScript), background (initializes the extension store and wires services), popup (React UI), and design-system (UI component library). It mandates that business logic should reside in src/core and be implemented as use-cases orchestrated through epics, and UI components should come from src/design-system/src. Listing 5. Example Instruction for Architecture 4 1 ## Architecture 2 - The project is pnpm workspace with several packages under `src/`: - `core` - shared business logic implemented in TypeScript. Source files live in `src/ core/src` and compile to `src/core/lib`. - `background` - initializes the extension store and wires services such as `IndexedDBFS `, `FetchLoader` and `M3u8Parser`. - `popup` - React user interface for interacting with playlists and downloads. - `design-system` - UI component library consumed by the popup. - `assets` - extension manifest and icons. 5 6 7 8 - Business logic should reside in `src/core`. Implement new features as 9 10 11 12 - UI components should come from `src/design-system/src` to keep styling 13 `use-cases` under `src/core/src/use-cases` and orchestrate them through epics in `src/core/src/controllers`. Background scripts should only coordinate these functions. consistent across the extension. Implementation Details. This instruction type provides specific details for implementing code or system components, including coding style guidelines. We observed these instructions in 69.9% of files. Listing 6 shows an example.10 This example provides code style guidelines, such as keeping code simple, explicit, typed, test-driven, and ready for automation. It also specifies constraints like using only ASCII characters in source files, the format for docstrings, preferring explicit constructs (e.g., no wildcard imports), referencing modules by alias, and using decorators like @beartype.beartype. Furthermore, it details naming conventions for classes (CamelCase), functions/variables (snake_case), constants (UPPER_SNAKE), and file descriptors/paths. Listing 6. Example Instruction for Implementation Details 1 # Code Style 2 3 - Keep code simple, explicit, typed, test-driven, and ready for automation. 4 - Source files are UTF-8 but must contain only ASCII characters. Do not use smart quotes, ellipses, em-dashes, emoji, or other non-ASCII glyphs. 5 - Docstrings are single unwrapped paragraph. Rely on your editor's soft-wrap. 6 - Prefer explicit over implicit constructs. No wildcard imports. 7 ... Build and Run. This instruction type outlines the process for compiling source code and running the application, often including key commands. This was the most prevalent category. We observed these instructions in 62.3% of files. Listing 7 shows an example.11 This example provides specific npm build commands, such as npm run dev (for WXT dev server with live reload), npm run dev:firefox (for Firefox MV2 dev session), npm run build (for production build), and npm run build:firefox (for building and packaging for Firefox). Listing 7. Example Instruction for Build and Run 1 ## Build Commands 10https://github.com/samuelstevens/biobench/blob/main/AGENTS.md 11https://github.com/Pedal-Intelligence/saypi-userscript/blob/main/CLAUDE.md , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

Testing. This instruction type details the procedures and commands for executing automated tests. We observed these instructions in 75.0% of files. Listing 8 shows an example.12 This example provides guidelines for writing tests using DOM and user interactions rather than internal implementation details, commands for running different test suites with their execution times, and warnings about environment-specific failures and testing constraints. Listing 8. Example Instruction for Testing 1 ### Testing 2 3 ### Writing Tests in `@compass/web` 4 5 - Write tests the way user would use the application by using the DOM and user interactions with `@testing-library/user-event` rather than internal implementation details of React components. 6 - Do NOT use `data-` attributes or CSS selectors to locate elements. Use semantic locators and roles instead. 7 8 #### Running Tests 9 10 - **Core tests**: `yarn test:core` - Takes 2 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Always tests pass. 11 - **Web tests**: `yarn test:web` - Takes 15 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. All tests pass 12 - **Full test suite**: `yarn test` - Takes 18 seconds but FAILS in restricted environments due to MongoDB binary download from fastdl.mongodb.org - Use individual package tests instead: `yarn test:core` and `yarn test:web` 13 14 - **DO NOT** attempt to test login functionality without proper backend setup 15 - **ALWAYS** run `yarn test:core` and `yarn test:web` and `yarn test:backend` after making changes Configuration and Environments. This instruction type provides instructions for configuring the system and setting up the development or production environment. We observed these instructions in 38.0% of files. Listing 9 shows an example.13 This example provides commands for environment setup, including setting up git configuration (cp example.gitconfig .git/config), creating and activating virtual environment (uv venv and source .venv/bin/activate), and installing development dependencies (uv pip install -e .[dev]). Listing 9. Example Instruction for Configuration and Environments 1 ## Development Commands 2 ### Environment Setup 3 ```bash 4 # Set up git configuration (recommended for development) 5 cp example.gitconfig .git/config 6 git config user.name \"Your Name\" 7 git config user.email \"your.email@example.com\" 12https://github.com/SwitchbackTech/compass/blob/main/AGENTS.md 13https://github.com/basher83/ProxmoxMCP/blob/main/CLAUDE.md , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

This instruction type covers procedures for software deployment, release, and operations, such as CI/CD pipelines. We observed these instructions in 18.1% of files. Listing 10 shows an example.14 This example provides information on CI Parity, detailing the CI pipeline defined in .github/workflows/ci.yml and listing various checks included, such as cargo check, cargo test, cargo clippy -D warnings, and Typos check. Listing 10. Example Instruction for DevOps 1 ## CI Parity 2 The CI pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and includes: 3 4 5 6 7 8 - `cargo check` for all targets - `cargo test` on core crates - `cargo fmt -- --check` - `cargo clippy -D warnings` - `cargo doc` - Typos check (`crate-ci/typos`) Development Process. This kind of instruction defines the development workflow, including guidelines for version control systems like Git. We observed these instructions in 63.3% of files. Listing 11 outlines an example of these kinds of instructions.15 In this example, the project provides Commit & Pull Request Guidelines, specifying that commits must use the imperative mood and prefer Conventional Commits (e.g., feat:, fix:), requiring developers to run quality checks (just fmt, just mypy, just test) before pushing, and outlining requirements for PRs (summary, linked issues, screenshots, migration notes, and passing CI). Listing 11. Example Instruction for Development Process 1 ## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines 2 - Commits: imperative mood; prefer Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`) with clear scope. 3 - Before pushing: run `just fmt`, `just mypy`, and `just test`; ensure Django checks pass. 4 - PRs: include summary, linked issues, screenshots for UI changes, and migration notes when applicable. CI must be green. Project Management. This kind of instruction relates to the planning, organization, and management of the project. We observed these instructions in 5.4% of files. Listing 12 outlines an example of these kinds of instructions.16 In this example, the project provides guidance on the Backlog & Future Improvements stored in the backlog/ directory, detailing its purpose (storage for enhancement plans), the required format (Markdown files with structured plans and mandatory 14https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs/blob/master/AGENTS.md#ci-parity 15https://github.com/eduzen/website/blob/main/AGENTS.md 16https://github.com/reinier/dotfiles/blob/main/CLAUDE.md , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2025. 16 Chatlatanagulchai et al. YAML front matter), and instructs users to reference backlog items to understand context and priorities. Listing 12. Example Instruction for Project Management 1 ## Backlog & Future Improvements 2 The `backlog/` directory contains planned improvements and refactoring tasks: 3 - Purpose: Organized storage for enhancement plans, technical debt items, and future feature ideas 4 - Format: Markdown files with structured plans including problem statements, proposed solutions, and implementation strategies 5 - Front Matter: All backlog items MUST include YAML front matter with `status` (todoin progressdone), `date_created`, and `date_modified` fields 6 - Template: Use `backlog/_template.md` as starting point for new backlog items to ensure consistent structure and required front matter 7 - Usage: When suggesting improvements or picking up development work, reference backlog items to understand context and priorities 8 - Current Items: 9 - `timer-api-refactor.md` - Plan to refactor the monolithic timer-api.lua into modular components - `directory-watcher-system.md` - Plan for automated file organization system COMPLETED 11 12 When working on this repository, check the backlog directory for relevant planned improvements that could be implemented alongside current tasks. Maintenance. This kind of instruction provides guidelines for system maintenance, including strategies for improving readability, detecting and resolving bugs. We observed these instructions in 43.7% of files. Listing 13 outlines an example of these kinds of instructions.17 In this example, the project provides Core Development Principles focused on maintaining stable public interfaces, specifically advising agents to always attempt to preserve function signatures, argument positions, and names for exported methods, and listing essential checks required before making changes to public APIs. Listing 13. Example Instruction for Maintenance 1 ## Core Development Principles 2 3 ### 1. Maintain Stable Public Interfaces CRITICAL 4 5 **Always attempt to preserve function signatures, argument positions, and names for exported/public methods.** pass # Changed from `user_id` 6 7 **Bad - Breaking Change:** 8 9 ```python 10 def get_user(id, verbose=False): 11 12 ``` 13 14 **Good - Stable Interface:** 15 16 ```python 17 def get_user(user_id: str, verbose: bool = False) -> User: \"\"\"Retrieve user by ID with optional verbose output.\"\"\" 18 pass 19 20 ``` 17https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/CLAUDE.md , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2025. Agent READMEs: An Empirical Study of Context Files for Agentic Coding 17 21 22 **Before making ANY changes to public APIs:** 23 24 - Check if the function/class is exported in `__init__.py` 25 - Look for existing usage patterns in tests and examples 26 - Use keyword-only arguments for new parameters: `*, new_param: str = \"default\"` 27 - Mark experimental features clearly with docstring warnings (using MkDocs Material admonitions, like `!!! warning`) 28 29 *Ask yourself:* \"Would this change break someone's code if they used it last week?\" Performance. This kind of instruction focuses on system performance, quality assurance, and potential optimizations. We observed these instructions in 14.5% of files. Listing 14 outlines an example of these kinds of instructions.18 In this example, the project provides performance guidelines for React 19, explaining when automatic compiler optimizations are sufficient versus when manual optimization is needed, and listing specific considerations for maintaining optimal performance. Listing 14. Example Instruction for Performance optimizations - Heavy computational functions inside components - Complex object/array transformations - Expensive child component renders with stable props - Event handlers passed to many children 1 ## Performance Guidelines 2 3 ### React 19 Optimizations 4 - **Automatic optimizations**: React 19 compiler handles most memo/callback 5 6 - **When to still optimize manually**: 7 8 9 10 11 12 ### Performance Considerations 13 - Avoid inline object/array creation in render 14 - Avoid function components defined inside component or other unstable 15 16 - Use stable references for callbacks passed as props 17 - Look for unstable props or children 18 - Debounce/throttle expensive operations functions Security. This kind of instruction addresses security considerations, vulnerabilities, or best practices for the system. This was one of the least prevalent categories, observed in only 14.5% of files. Listing 15 outlines an example of these kinds of instructions.19 In this example, the project provides details on the Security Architecture and Permission System. It highlights core principles like Workspace Isolation and Default Protection for preventing unauthorized access, and defines different Service Visibility Levels with their access permissions. Listing 15. Example Instruction for Security 1 ## Security Architecture and Permission System 2 3 ### Core Security Principles 4 18https://github.com/hedoluna/fft/blob/main/CLAUDE.md 19https://github.com/amun-ai/hypha/blob/main/CLAUDE.md?plain=1 , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2025. 18 Chatlatanagulchai et al. 5 Hypha implements multi-layered security model with workspace isolation as the foundation. All services have default protection through workspace visibility settings, with additional fine-grained permission controls available for sensitive operations. 6 7 ### Default Protection: Workspace Isolation 8 9 By default, all services are `protected`, meaning they are only accessible to clients within the same workspace. This provides automatic protection against unauthorized crossworkspace access without requiring explicit permission checks in every method. \"config\": { }, # Service methods... \"require_context\": True, \"visibility\": \"protected\", 10 11 ```python 12 # Services created with default protected visibility 13 interface = { 14 15 16 17 18 19 } 20 ``` 21 22 ### Service Visibility Levels 23 24 1. `protected` (DEFAULT) - Only accessible by clients in the same workspace 25 2. `public` - Accessible by all authenticated users across workspaces 26 3. `unlisted` - Same as public, accessible for all users, but not discoverable # Default: only accessible within workspace UI/UX. This kind of instruction contains guidelines or details concerning the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). This was the least prevalent category overall, observed in only 8.7% of files. Listing 16 outlines an example of these kinds of instructions.20 In this example, the project provides User Experience Standards, mandating an invisible, Netflix-like user experience where data loading and processing occur automatically in the background. The key principles include automatic data handling, subtle notifications, progressive loading, and eliminating the need for manual user intervention. Listing 16. Example Instruction for UI/UX 1 ## User Experience Standards 2 This project follows an **invisible, Netflix-like user experience** where data loading and processing happens automatically in the background. Key principles: 3 1. Database-first: Always query cached data before API calls 4 2. Auto-detection: Automatically detect and fix data quality issues 5 3. Subtle notifications: Keep users informed without interrupting workflow 6 4. Progressive enhancement: Core functionality works immediately, enhanced features load in background 7 5. No manual intervention: Users never need to click \"Load Data\" or understand technical details Debugging. This kind of instruction is one of the new categories added during the analysis because many cases could not be categorized into existing labels. We observed these instructions in 24.4% of files. Listing 17 outlines an example of these kinds of instructions.21 In this example, the project provides Debugging Tips, specifically commands like using DEBUG=1 for verbose output, 20https://github.com/bdougie/contributor.info/blob/main/CLAUDE.md 21https://github.com/probelabs/probe/blob/main/CLAUDE.md , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

Agent READMEs: An Empirical Study of Context Files for Agentic Coding 21 context for an AI agent become unmaintainable and opaque to human collaborators. This creates paradox where mechanism designed to align agents increases the cognitive load on developers. Future work should formalize context debt by identifying specific context file smells (e.g., ambiguous directives, conflicting role definitions) and by developing metrics beyond standard readability scores to assess the maintainability of agent instructions. Model the co-evolution of agent context files and code to automate maintenance. Contrary to the write-once nature of traditional READMEs [21], our findings in Section 4.2 show that agent context files are actively maintained, with 67.4% of Claude Code files undergoing multiple modifications. These updates often occur in short bursts and involve incremental additions rather than deletions. This active evolution indicates tight coupling between context files and the underlying codebase. When code is refactored, related instructions in the context file (e.g., Build and Run commands) risk becoming outdated. Researchers should study this co-evolutionary relationship to develop CI-integrated tools that automatically detect divergences. For example, researchers can design linter for agent context files which could verify that the commands listed in the Build and Run section (62.3% prevalence) match the actual scripts in package.json or Makefile, which would reduce the manual effort required for synchronization. Investigate the blind spots of agentic coding and build related benchmarks. Our content analysis (Section 4.3) highlights critical gap: while functional categories like Build and Run and Implementation Details dominate, non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as Security (14.5%) and Performance (14.5%) are notably rare. This suggests that agents are currently conditioned to prioritize functionality over quality attributes. If benchmarks (e.g., SWE-bench [28]) do not penalize agents for generating insecure or inefficient code, this blind spot will persist. The research community should design new benchmarks or evaluation frameworks that explicitly test an agents adherence to NFRs defined in agent context files. Tasks should require agents to pass unit tests and comply with security constraints and architectural patterns specified in the context file."

The scarcity of instructions related to Security and Performance (Section 4.3) serves as warning. Unlike human senior developers who may implicitly understand secure coding practices, AI agents rely heavily on explicit context. If security guidelines are absent from the context file, agents may produce functional yet vulnerable code (e.g., SQL injection risks). Developers should proactively structure their agent context files to include mandatory sections for NFRs. Directives such as All database interactions must use parameterized queries or Do not commit secrets should be codified within the context file to act as continuous guardrails during generation. Implement versioning and governance for agent context files evolution.

Our structural analysis in\nSection 4.1 shows that agent context files follow a consistent, shallow hierarchy based on H1\nand H2 headers. Tool builders can use this pattern to lower the barrier to entry for developers.\nInstead of presenting an empty text editor, IDEs and agent interfaces should provide templated\nscaffolds pre-populated with the common categories identified in Section 4.3 (e.g., Build and\nRun, Implementation Details, Testing). These templates should also include placeholders for\nfrequently neglected NFR categories (Security, Performance), which would encourage more\ncomprehensive documentation.",
            "content": "Optimize context retrieval using semantic categorization. The categorization of instructions (Table 3 in Section 4.3) indicates that agent context files contain distinct clusters of information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for coding agents should move beyond naive text chunking and use this semantic structure. When an agent is tasked with fixing bug, for example, retrieval should prioritize sections labeled Debugging (24.4%) and Testing, while deprioritizing unrelated sections like DevOps. By parsing the hierarchy of context file, agent builders can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the context supplied to the LLM, which should lead to more accurate and relevant code generation."

            "title": "6.1 AI agents in software engineering\nAI in software development is shifting from single-turn code completion to agentic software en-\ngineering [26]. In this paradigm, agents understand high-level goals, produce plans, and execute\nmulti-step tasks with minimal human intervention [10, 11, 55, 67]. These agents combine an LLM-\nbased reasoning core with memory, planning modules, and tool use, such as interacting with IDEs,\nrunning tests, and invoking external services [17, 38]. This reframes LLMs from autocomplete\nengines into components within larger systems that must be configured, orchestrated, and main-\ntained [29, 72]. Architectures are converging on perception, memory, and action patterns, where\nagents ingest context, ground decisions in persistent memory, and act through tool APIs [67].",
            "content": "Research has expanded from simple code generation to agents that can interactively clarify ambiguous requirements [15, 41, 70], refactor code [8, 27], and assess code quality [74]. Collaboration mechanisms further boost effectiveness. For example, multi-agent pair programming splits strategic planning and tactical coding across coordinated roles, such as Navigator and Driver agents [76], and scalable human-in-the-loop frameworks that keep developers in control of plans and reviews while letting agents draft and iterate code [44, 63]. Existing studies primarily focus on the agents internal architecture and collaborative behavior, that is, how the agents reason and coordinate, rather than how they are configured from the outside. 22https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-yourrepository/about-code-owners , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2025. Agent READMEs: An Empirical Study of Context Files for Agentic Coding 23 Automatic program repair (APR) has been an early beneficiary of this paradigm. Base LLMs already rival or surpass traditional APR pipelines on several benchmarks [16, 22, 71], while agentized repair further improves reliability by iterating between code changes, test execution, and analysis [10]. Related work integrates specification extraction and formal feedback into the loop so that agents can better infer intent and refine patches [15, 41, 54]. Beyond repair and generation, agents have been proposed for autonomous testing [17] and code quality support, such as detecting smells and providing maintainability guidance [74]. With greater integration comes new failure modes. Empirical studies report integration defects and security risks across agent, vector store, connector, and execution layers [56]. For example, model context protocol (MCP) helps agents to integrate tools but introduces security risks [25]. At the same time, evaluating agents remains costly and variable. Comprehensive test-based assessments are expensive, while LLM-as-a-judge evaluations can be inconsistent. Real-world utilization depends on collaboration patterns and process fit [44, 62, 63]. These observations highlight the need for reliable artifacts and practices that communicate project-specific constraints to agents and keep behavior aligned over time. Our work targets this missing layer: persistent configuration and context artifacts that steer agent behavior in real-world projects. Prior work optimizes models, tools, and workflows, and studies the agents internal architecture and coordination. In contrast, we study the documents that operationalize those workflows from the outside, namely agent context files such as CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and copilot-instructions.md files. While augmented language model designs advocate external tools, memory, and retrieval to ground decisions [38], the community lacks systematic understanding of how open-source projects encode roles, constraints, build and test routines, and conventions for agents at scale. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis of these manifests, quantifying their structure, maintenance, and instruction taxonomies, and complementing existing work with evidence about the project-level artifacts."

Over 90% of READMEs\nmention basic information such as project name, description, and usage instructions [47].

            "content": "Researchers have reported documentation issues found in software projects [4], but evaluating documentation quality remains challenging. Automatic metrics adapted from machine translation and summarization, such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, are widely used to assess generated comments and summaries [23, 37, 49]. However, several studies show that improvements in these metrics often fail to align with human-perceived usefulness, with only moderate correlations and even ranking inversions relative to practitioner judgments [30, 53, 59]. Beyond static quality, research also examines how documentation evolves. Studies on codecomment co-evolution show frequent inconsistencies [68], and techniques have been developed to detect outdated or contradictory statements in API documentation and narratives [64, 79]. Dynamic and hybrid approaches leverage runtime values or execution traces to generate or validate documentation, showing benefits for specific method categories [60, 61]. Recent datasets explicitly target code-documentation alignment during maintenance, underscoring that synchronization remains persistent challenge [43]. , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: November 2025. 24 Chatlatanagulchai et al. Documentation concerns also surface in code review. Large-scale analyses show that reviewers routinely discuss, request, and amend documentation, making review key gatekeeper for documentation quality [50]. Automated assistance increasingly participates in this process: review bots influence project throughput and communication patterns [69], and specialized frameworks detect and repair defects in API directives, including parameters and exceptions, with high precision [79]. Prior work has primarily investigated documentation written by developers for developers, focusing on its quality, evolution, and automation. In contrast, we study agent-facing, persistent configuration artifacts (agent context files) that encode project context, roles, and operating rules for coding agents. To our knowledge, such manifests have not been examined at scale in the documentation literature cited above."

            "title": "6.3 Context engineering\nA growing body of work investigates context engineering, which extends beyond traditional prompt\nengineering to optimize how developers provide information to AI coding agents. While prompt\nengineering typically optimizes transient, task-level interactions, context engineering concerns\npersistent artifacts such as configuration files, documentation, and contextual instructions that\ncontinuously shape agent behavior across sessions and projects. Researchers are empirically exam-\nining how different instruction strategies affect agent performance on diverse software engineering\ntasks, including code generation [57], automated program repair [71, 73], and repository-level code\ncompletion [58].",
            "content": "This research can be broadly divided into two complementary areas: (a) the study of immediate, task-specific prompts, and (b) the study of persistent, project-level context. Much of the existing literature focuses on optimizing the immediate instructions that developers provide for specific, in-the-moment tasks. These include reasoning-oriented techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) for multi-step tasks [45], interactive methods involving reflection and dialogue [40, 77], and analyses of recurring patterns in developers conversational prompts [31]. Other studies examine knowledgeenriched prompts that embed domain-specific data, such as UML model constraints [1] or exception handling patterns [51], to produce more robust and reliable outputs. Complementing this, other work highlights that primary failure mode for AI assistants is fundamental lack of contextual awareness [6, 66], problem that cannot be solved by single prompt alone. This challenge has driven the development of mechanisms that provide agents with persistent, repository-level context [24, 58]. These context-rich approaches integrate repositorylevel information such as imports, module hierarchies, or architectural metadata to improve code completion and adaptation [20, 58]. Studies consistently show that such fine-grained, knowledgedriven context yields substantial improvements in code quality, correctness, and reliability over simple zero-shot prompts [1, 42, 57]. As providing this context becomes core development activity, managing these instructions as long-lived artifacts has emerged as new software engineering challenge [32]. While prior studies have explored the effects of providing repository-level context [20, 58] or the content of conversational prompts [31], the artifacts that developers create to manage this persistent context remain unexamined. This paper presents the first empirical study of agent manifests (e.g., CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) as key artifacts of context engineering, analyzing their structure, content, and maintenance patterns to understand how developers curate the persistent instructions that guide agentic coding in practice."

The\nprimary motivation for this research was the significant lack of accessible documentation for\ncreating these manifest files, which has historically forced developers into inefficient trial-and-error\napproaches when configuring their agents. Our investigation systematically analyzed 2,303 context\nfiles collected from 1,925 open-source repositories to provide an empirical foundation for best\npractices.",
            "content": "Our findings regarding the characteristics of agent context files reveal that these files are generally long and difficult to read. Additionally, such files for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot are substantially longer than those for OpenAI Codex, suggesting developers provide much larger volume of natural language instruction to these agents. Critically, the readability of these files is poor; the documents are complex, with many categorized as very difficult category typically associated with dense academic or legal documents. Structurally, manifests are consistently organized with shallow hierarchy, anchored by single H1 heading and using H2 and H3 subsections to define major topics, pattern that likely aids developers in quickly parsing and maintaining the documents. Furthermore, unlike conventional software documentation often characterized as write-once, agent context files are actively maintained, behaving as evolving configuration artifacts.

Publication date: November 2025. 26 Chatlatanagulchai et al. commits, with maintenance occurring in short, rapid bursts. This evolution is driven by small, incremental content additions, while content deletions are negligible. The analysis of instructional content demonstrated that developers primarily focus on actionoriented, functional guidance necessary for execution and maintenance. The most prevalent instructions address practical operations, including Build and Run (62.3%), Implementation Details (69.9%), and Architecture (67.7%). However, the study identified critical omissions: instructions addressing non-functional requirements (NFRs), such as Security (14.5%), Performance (14.5%), and UI/UX (8.7%), were notably infrequent. This suggests that agents are extensively guided on how to build the code functionally, but not necessarily on how to build it well concerning quality attributes.
