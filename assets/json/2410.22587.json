Abstract Open-source large language models are becoming increasingly available and popular among researchers and practitioners. While significant progress has been made on open-weight models, open training data is practice yet to be adopted by the leading open-weight models creators. At the same time, there researchers are working to make language models safer. We propose data curation pipeline to reduce harmful outputs by models trained on public domain data. There are unique challenges to working with public domain data, as these sources differ from web text in both form and content. Many sources are historical documents and are the result of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Consequently, current state-of-the-art approaches to toxicity filtering are often infeasible or inappropriate for open data models. In this paper, we introduce new fully open-source pipeline for open-data toxicity filtering. Our contributions are threefold. We create custom training dataset, ToxicCommons, which is composed of texts which have been classified across five different dimensions (racial/origin-based, gender/sexbased, religious, ability-based discrimination, and violence). We use this dataset to train custom classifier, Celadon, that can be used to detect toxic content in open data more efficiently at larger scale. Finally, we describe the balanced approach to content filtration that optimizes safety filtering with respect to the filtered data available for training. (cid:135) https://github.com/Pleias/toxic-commons ToxicCommons Model: Celadon Dataset: Introduction There are growing calls for transparency surrounding Large Language Models (LLM) (Bommasani et al., 2024). Legislation about safety and openness requirements such as EU AI Act (European Parliament, 2024) and Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (Executive Office of the President, 2023) are the first steps made by governments to ensure some form of LLM transparency. As emphasis on open models increases, developers open more parts of their training pipelines (Liu et al., 2023; Mehta et al., 2024; Faysse *equal contribution Work conducted while an intern at PleIAs. et al., 2024). The performance gap between open and closedweights models is closing fast: Metas Llama 3.1 405B Instruct (Meta Llama Team, 2024) and Mistrals Mistral Large 2 (Mistral, 2024) are both competitive when compared with frontier closed-source models (Chiang et al., 2024). Despite the increasing popularity and power of open-weight models, many modern open\" models do not meet the requirements of the openness matrix (Liesenfeld and Dingemanse, 2024), where the openness of model takes into consideration not just model weights, but model-related artifacts such as training code and training data, documentation, and access to the model. Open training data is the dimension of openness that lags behind the most (Bommasani et al., 2024). Since some of the closed models are clearly trained on proprietary data that is scraped without the consent of the data creator, the lack of openness surrounding model training data poses significant ethical challenges (Longpre et al., 2024a). Open data presents unique challenges that this work tries to address. We hope that the provided data, pipeline and filtration principles will help to intensify work on open-data LLMs. Curating Public Domain Data Closed-source model developers consistently utilize copyrighted material in their training sets. OpenAI has been sued for using copyrighted newspaper data (Robertson, 2024), while Apple, Nvidia, and Anthropic have all been criticized by the YouTube community after being caught using copyrighted videos in their models (Gilbertson and Reisner, 2024). In contrast, the open-source community is pushing for greater transparency by adopting open-data practices. Key leaders have released not only open-weights models but training data as well, such as Dolma (Soldaini et al., 2024) used to train OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024) and the Pile (Gao et al., 2020) used to train the Pythia models (Biderman et al., 2023), inter alia. Upon inspection, these open corpora contain lot of implicit bias and stereotypes against certain gender, racial, ethnic, or disability groups (Bender et al., 2021; Dodge et al., 2021; Luccioni and Viviano, 2021). Unfortunately, the documentation of the open data curation pipelines is often lacking, and methods can be ad hoc or have little regard for the context of the data (Henderson et al., 2022). More resources need to be dedicated to curating and documenting the construction of these datasets in order to reduce disproportionate impacts on the most vulnerable groups at the margins of society (Birhane and Cummins, 2019; Birhane and Prabhu, 2021; Bender et al., 2021). Data curation, as well as other methods designed to address safety of open LLMs are to be understood in Bayesian sense: though it is highly unlikely that one could ever design safety tool that could enable non-toxic generation with probability one, every effort reduces the prior of the model for toxic behavior. Common Corpus1 was recently released. It is the largest public domain dataset for training language models. It comprises multilingual datasets, mostly coming from books and periodicals, and as such has great deal of cultural heritage content. In order to be in the public domain, many of these texts are historical. Most of the texts come from the 18th and 19th centuries, and some are much older. This kind of public domain data poses different set of challenges, relative to existing open datasets, which are often largely comprised of web text. While the toxicity of web text is well documented, (Bender et al., 2021; Groeneveld et al., 2024), we know much less about the risks posed by historical data. As societal norms, especially in the language surrounding minoritized and racialized groups, have changed substantially even over the last few decades. In order to use historical text data safely, we propose that it be classified and filtered. Existing toxicity classifiers are not well-suited to this task. Toxicity classifiers perform poorly on out-of-domain data (Adragna et al., 2020). Existing toxicity classifiers are trained to perform well on web text, which is unlike Common Corpus in style and content, due to text domain and genre, language change, and other factors. Toxicity classifiers have been shown to perform poorly on historical data (Borenstein et al., 2023). Additionally, much of the data in Common Corpus is collected via optical character recognition (OCR), which introduces noise into the data. OCR affects many NLP tasks (van Strien et al., 2020). Specifically, Borenstein et al. (2023) show that OCR errors lead to less accurate toxicity classification. We test an existing toxicity classifier on sample from Common Corpus. As it was trained to detect toxicity in contemporary web text, it generalizes very poorly to Common Corpus data. For example, we find that the toxicity classifier tends to assign higher toxicity when texts contain large amounts of capital letters. The classifier we tested also seems overly sensitive to words that may often appear in toxic or violent content, but are not necessarily toxic or harmful in many contexts, e.g. fear, army. We provide details and examples in Appendix Finally, there is less data available to developers in the public domain. While web text datasets are comprised of hundreds of gigabytes of data, historical data which has been digitized is much more sparse. Using ill-suited filtering methods may lead to removing large amounts of already limited data. We must not only identify problematic content 1https://huggingface.co/ collections/PleIAs/common-corpus65d46e3ea3980fdcd66a5613 with high accuracy, but we must also find way to transform data with low-levels of toxicity into useful data that contributes to safer open model. In this paper, we create classifier specific to Common Corpus in order to filter the data and prepare it for synthetic treatment. We also propose this as framework, which can be used in combination with our open and replicable methods to be adapted for any dataset. We show that it is possible to efficiently and effectively curate datasets that can help reduce unwanted model behaviors."

            "content": "Safety Guardrails Much of the work on creating safer language models focuses on post-training procedures. For models deployed through APIs and web interfaces, continual refinement and tuning both through parameter updates and also through system prompting and output moderation are common approaches. These methods have clear advantages over openweights models when it comes to trust and safety; however, this does not always translate to explicitly better performance in this respect, as even frontier versions of these models can be jail-broken with ease (Wei et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024). There are also existing tools which can be deployed by developers of generative AI software to prevent AI-based software from violating safety policies. For example, Meta released Llama Guard 3, Prompt Guard, and Code Shield (Meta Llama Team, 2024) in order to help developers utilizing generative AI tools ensure that model outputs adhere to safety policies. Code Shield as tool can be deployed at inference time, providing obvious benefits to developers of closed-source software. Googles recent Shield Gemma (Zeng et al., 2024) builds upon previous success of Llama Guard 3, and helps the open-source community by advancing content moderation tools. However, when it comes to open-weights models, safety measures can only be implemented during pre-training and fine-tuning, and cannot be deployed in between the model and the user. Serving as an example of the difficulties open-weights model developers face, Llama Guard 3 was integrated into the Llama 3.1 release, and yet the results of this effort were quickly undone (Gade et al., 2023). As result, we argue that safety pipelines for open-source generative AI must start with thorough data filtering. Filtering Model Training Data Apart from post-training procedures, strategy for mitigating harmful model behaviors is dataset curation, often through filtering out harmful content in the training data. Most toxicity filtering on pre-training datasets falls into one of three categories: URL-based filtering, lexicon-based filtering, and classifier-based methods (Albalak et al., 2024). Datasets like FineWeb (Penedo et al., 2024) and the Llama 3 pre-training dataset (Meta Llama Team, 2024) filter out content that comes from URLs that are on blacklists, such as the UT1 URL Blacklist (Prigent, 2024). While this method may effectively reduce the amount of pornographic content, it does not directly address other kinds of toxic or offensive content that frequently appears in web text. It has also been shown that blocking pornographic content also reduce the amount of LGBTQ+ and African American English (AAE) text (Dodge et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). This in turn may lead to lack of diversity or representation. Lexical filtering refers to removing documents that contain blacklisted words. This method was used to create the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4; Raffel et al. (2020)), which is used to train Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and more. In this case, any document that contained any word from the List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words\"2 was removed. The ROOTS corpus (Laurençon et al., 2022), which was used to train BLOOM (Scao et al., 2023) also filtered out texts that contained high ratios of words associated with pornographic spam. Aggressive filtering may lead to performance degradation (Henderson et al., 2022), because filters remove high quality data (Longpre et al., 2024b). This can occur especially when blacklisted words are filtered without considering their context, as some slurs or offensive terms may be acceptable in some specific contexts (Warner and Hirschberg, 2012). For example, slur or offensive term may be used in the discussion of that term without being toxic or offensive (Henderson et al., 2022). Additionally, some words in the commonly used bad words\" lists have other, non-offensive uses. For example, we found high instances of bitch used in one dataset of historical newspapers, which always referred to female dogs or other animals. Finally, there are classifier-based methods for dataset filtering. When toxicity classifiers have been used to filter pretraining data, the classifiers have often been black-box, proprietary products. Gopher data was filtered using Google SafeSearch (Rae et al., 2021), which primarily filters out pornographic content (Monea, 2023). Palm 2 used fixed version of Perspective API3 to generate control tokens for subset of the data (Anil et al., 2023). The Perspective API specifically has been shown to be more accurate than heuristics or rule-based classifiers (Longpre et al., 2024b), but black-box APIs are not reproducible (Pozzobon et al., 2023). The Dolma dataset was filtered using FastText classifiers trained to identify text using the labels hate\" and NSFW\" (Soldaini et al., 2024). To the best of our knowledge, this work presents one of the only large-scale filtering procedures using open or reproducible methods for open pre-training data. There have been limited studies on the effects of these filters, however, more research is needed to understand how they affect model behavior (Albalak et al., 2024). Data Filtering Pipeline In this paper, we propose strategy of safety guardrails for open-data language modeling, especially well suited for issues specific to public domain data. We release classifier 2https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-DirtyNaughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words 3https://perspectiveapi.com/ and dataset specifically created for toxicity filtration in opensource datasets. In this section, we outline our strategy for the curation of the dataset and creation of the classifier: 1. Annotation Process: We use human annotations to guide the LLM annotation process, in order to allow for scalability of annotation while remaining true to the ground truth of the samples. 2. Toxicity Classifier: Using the LLM-generated annotations, we train classifier capable of identifying toxic content across four levels of severity (0, 1, 2, 3) in five different categories (race and origin-based, genderbased, ability-based, religion-based discrimination, as well as violence). 3. Synthetic Re-writing For Content Moderation: After classifying texts based on the above categories, we implement different content moderation policies depending on the severity of the problem. Texts with only low levels of toxicity are included with content warning, while the most egregious samples get re-written and reintroduced into the corpus in detoxified\" form. We recognize that the dataset, composed of historical and post-OCR data, poses unique challenges to general opensource data, let alone closed-source data. It is our hope that not only can our dataset and classifier be used on similar types of data, but our process can be generalized to other use cases by the community at large. Dataset We chose 13 cultural heritage datasets from Common Corpus, which includes datasets from nine languages. All datasets are comprised of copyright-free, public domain text data. Several datasets were created from OCR data, so we applied OCR correction using OCRonos4 to reduce noise in the data. OCR correction does not remove all OCR errors, so there is still some noise from the digitization process in the data.

Human Annotations In order to create baseline to compare the LLM annotations against, human-annotation of small subset of 15 chunks was necessary5. These annotations were on mix of lowand high-toxicity datasets to monitor overand under-sensitivity. The annotators independently annotated and scored ten different texts, before creating unified ground-truth dataset from these annotated examples to evaluate LLM performance. We identify five types of bias to train the classifier to detect, which are frequently identified in the literature: Race and origin-based bias: includes racism as well as bias against someones country or region of origin or immigration status, especially immigrant or refugee status (Zhang et al., 2023). Gender and sexuality-based bias: includes sexism and misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, and sexual harassment (Sosto and Barrón-Cedeño, 2024). Religious bias: any bias or stereotype based on someones religion. Ability bias: bias according to someones physical, mental, or intellectual ability or disability (Farrelly et al., 2023). Violence and abuse: overly graphic descriptions of violence, threats of violence, or calls or incitement of violence (Saha et al., 2023). The annotators rated each text on dimension of bias on scale from 0 to 3. This scale was used for two reasons: it is easily explainable, such that we can make clear distinctions between categories, and it should not introduce any further complexities into the classification process. Any scale with more than four classes would prove to be difficult to properly explain to language model. LLM annotators are most effective when decisions are left up to as little interpretation as possible, and we felt that by clearly defining these four categories, we would attain the most success. Many classifiers are either binary, toxic or not toxic, or on continuous scale between 0 and 1. Neither of these methods suit our task; binary scale cannot properly capture the nuances of our dataset, and continuous scale is impossible to curate using LLM annotators. The four categories for classifying each dimension of bias are provided below: 0: Text mentions stereotypes about particular group of people or acts of violence, but does so in an objective way; text does not promote biases against any group or acts of violence. 1: Text implies biased beliefs against group of people or implicitly makes suggestions of violent acts, but does not do so explicitly. 2: Text clearly expresses biased beliefs against group of people, but does not do so in an overly aggressive manner, nor does it actively promote the spread of such beliefs. 3: Text overtly promotes hatred towards or disenfranchisement of group of people or promotes the superiority of one group of people over another; text calls for violence against an individual or group of people; text persuasively describes stereotypes or biases against group of people or characteristics associated with particular group (especially groups according to race, sex, gender, origin, ability, or religion). As texts were rated, the annotators did not consider any slurs or offensive terms in their annotations to reflect the process of the LLM annotations. The intention was to develop an annotation process that would detect implicit bias but would not be overly sensitive to certain lexical items."

            "content": "We tested three models and compared zero-shot and fewshot prompting strategies for the LLM annotations. We tested GPT-3.5, Claude 3 Haiku, and Llama 3.1. Claude was most likely to refuse to provide an annotation. Claude also tended to give higher ratings often giving score of 3 on given dimension, which often did not align with the human annotations. GPT-3.5 was more likely than the other models to underestimate the human toxicity scores. We found that Llama 3.1 was well-aligned with human annotations. Additionally Llama 3.1 is an open-weight model, which makes this procedure more easily replicable. We did not find that few-shot prompting improved the alignment of the model annotations with the gold human annotations. Fewshot prompting tended to make the models give higher toxicity ratings, even when not appropriate to do so. We report comparisons and examples in Appendix E. Using the human annotations as baseline, we refined prompt to generate scores and annotations on each of the five dimensions of bias. The prompt uses the same scale from 0 to 3 as for the human annotations. The prompt was designed to have relatively high bar for toxicity, so that only the most offensive content had score of 3 for given dimension. We report the prompt we developed in Appendix C. We provide examples of annotations for toxic text in Appendix F. Note that the content of the texts and annotations may be offensive or upsetting. We release the LLM-annotated dataset, ToxicCommons6, with 2M samples. We report the rates of each score above 0 for each dataset. Figure 1 shows the scores for the US Newspapers dataset. The scores for the other datasets are reported in Appendix D. We find that the dimension with the highest rates of scores above 0 is Violence. Llama 3.1, as well as other models we tested, were generally very sensitive to any description of violent events. For the other dimensions, we find that generally less than 5% of texts are assigned score above 0 for each of the other dimensions. 6https://huggingface.co/datasets/PleIAs/ 5We provide these annotations in full in Appendix B.

Table 2: Proportion of scores for each dimension out of 640,808 total samples. Model Architecture Celadon is 5-headed classifier with DeBERTa-v3-small (He et al., 2021) base. Each head is separate linear layer, which utilizes weights from custom weighted loss function in order to produce the final logits. Below is the weighted cross entropy loss function: LWCE(x, y) = (cid:88) i=1 wi yi log(ˆyi) Where: represents the input logits, and represents the true class labels. ˆyi is the predicted probability for class i, computed using the softmax function. is the total number of classes. wi is the weight assigned to class i. The weights wi are updated dynamically based on the confusion matrix. CMij is the number of instances of class predicted as class j, The row sums RowSumi = (cid:80)C j=1 CMij represent the total number of samples in the true class i, The column sums ColSumj = (cid:80)C i=1 CMij represent the total number of samples predicted as class j, The diagonal CMii represents the correctly classified samples for class i, We compute the false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP) for each class: FNi = RowSumi CMii FPi = ColSumi CMii The total error for class is the sum of false negatives and false positives: TotalErrori = FNi + FPi To update the weights for each class, we apply logarithmic scaling: wi = log(1 + TotalErrori) k=1 log(1 + TotalErrork) (cid:80)C Figure 1: Distribution of toxicity scores 1-3 for each of the five dimensions for US PD Newspapers. Not shown are the counts of texts with scores of 0, which represented the majority of texts in the corpus. Across the different datasets, US Newspapers, US Books, French Books, and Italian datasets have the highest toxicity scores, especially for violence and especially for the lowest toxicity level (1). The books datasets have the highest religious bias scores, which may be because books were more likely to have any religious content. High toxicity (3) scores are relatively consistent across datasets, always between 03% of texts. Across all datasets, we found highest toxicity rates for the violence and abuse dimension, relative to other dimensions. When tested different models, we found that all models were the most sensitive to the violence dimension. Toxicity Classifier We use the LLM annotations to train Celadon7, our toxicity classifier. The model was trained on just over 640K samples of data taken from the LLM annotation dataset, and validated on around 133K samples. The entire LLM annotation dataset comprises 2 million samples across the different datasets; however, due to the overwhelming majority of non-toxic data in the data, we did not use the whole dataset. Table 2 shows the number of samples, per category, per class, for the training split. An additional challenge was the much smaller quantity of non-zero-score samples for the ability-based discrimination dimension. Had we downsampled the majority classes completely to match the minority classes, the classifier would not have been trained on data that was truly representative of the distribution of samples in Common Corpus. Instead, we chose to make the maximum number of not toxic samples (samples where the sum of toxicity scores was 0) equal to the sum of all of the samples with at least some toxicity (samples where the sum of toxicity scores was 1 or more). Additional training details are provided in Appendix G, including the score distribution for the validation and training sets. Training code is avail7https://huggingface.co/PleIAs/celadon 8https://github.com/Pleias/toxic-commons Evaluation Results Classifier performance was further tested on held-out sample of 133K LLM annotations. Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 outline the test-set performance of the classifier on each of the various categories. We found very high performance according to precision, recall, F1, and accuracy metrics; however, we argue that these metrics are misleading for this task. Due to the low prevalence of ability-based discrimination, the classifier performs extremely well on all metrics by predicting the majority class (0) the most often. As result, we included weighted accuracy as an important metric for model evaluation, given the distribution of the scores across all four classes for each category. The classifier performs the best in terms of weighted accuracy for the violence category, yielding weighted accuracy of 74%. The model has lower values of precision, recall, F1, and accuracy for this category, relative tother. We argue this is an indicator of good model performance, as it suggests that the classifier is correctly predicting at or around the correct class most of the time. Specifically, we note the distribution of classifications per category. For religion-based toxicity, and violence, the distribution of guesses centers about the correct class. Critically, samples that are true 0s are likeliest to be predicted as 0, with 1 being next likeliest at much lower rate. True 1s are likeliest to be predicted 1s, then 0s, then 2s, 2s are likeliest to be predicted as 2s, 1s, then 3s, and 3s are likeliest to be predicted as 3s or 2s. This is an important feature of the classifier, as we aim not to be over-sentitive in the filtering of this dataset. Furthermore, the classifier consistently predicts one class lower than the true class as the second majority class, which signals that the classifier does not often to predict higher scores than is true. The purpose of the classifier is to quickly and efficiently identify samples of text which should be annotated by an expert LLM annotator, and for this task, it excels in its duties.

No Toxicity: total score of 0-3 with no individual category score exceeding 2. These texts either have no toxic content, or very low levels not warranting any further treatment. We allow some breathing room with scores of 2 for any overly-sensitive cases. 2. Mild Toxicity: total score of between 4 and 6, or total score of 3 where that score comes from 3 in single category. For lower score of 3, we require the sole contribution to come from single category, while higher scores indicate toxicity across multiple categories in significant manner. 3. Toxic Content: The sum of scores is 7 or greater. This text likely contains toxic content that requires scrutiny from an LLM annotator. The thresholds used to divide the data into these three categories reflect our desire to not over-correct texts in our dataset. As mentioned previously, over-correction is almost as detrimental to our work as under-correction. It is critical that the historical nature and context of the data be preserved as much as possible, and removing too much content would reduce many of the benefits of working with public domain and especially cultural heritage data. As result, we aimed to be more lenient with our thresholds, accounting for the fact that there are two potential vectors for over-sensitivity: the LLM annotations, and then the distilled classifier. These thresholds reflect deliberate decisions that we made as result of our specific task, but it is important to note that as we release this pipeline to the broader community, these thresholds will adjust depending on individual needs. The classifier acts as useful intermediary: the smaller architecture of the DeBERTa-v3-small model means that it is deployable at scale much more efficiently than LLM9. However, we reintroduce the LLM back into the pipeline for the final step of 9We found that Celadon is over 40 times faster than Llama for annotations. On an NVIDIA H100 GPU, it took 3.43 hours (205 minutes) to annotate 100k samples with Llama, and only 5 minutes the process, which annotating or re-writing texts which have been labeled as toxic. The classifier proves to be an incredible useful heuristic when it comes to identifying toxic text, however, we recognize due to the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, it is not always accurate. As result, the re-introduction of the LLM annotator is critical part of the pipeline, both for annotating or re-writing text that is actually problematic, or to better contextualize text that isnt. Content Warning. The first LLM treatment for toxic data is to synthetically generate content warning for the text. The intention is to develop datasets that can help models to reason about harmful content and ideas. To do this, we use Llama 3.1. We wrote the initial prompt in English, and then translated it to the remaining languages, in order to ensure that the LLM annotator would not default to English for its annotations, and instead match the parent language of the original text. Were we to obtain results where the entirety of the content warnings were in English, we would not only introduce greater imbalance of English tokens into the dataset, but we would also artificially align content moderation outputs with the English language. Further, by utilizing Llama 3.1, we rely on its multilingual capabilities in order to better contextualize the texts in different languages. We provide the LLM annotator with the previously defined bias categories as well as their definitions. We then prompt it to create content warning that includes justification for why the content may be toxic, utilizing cultural, ethical, legal, or moral arguments. We also encourage it to state if the provided text is not toxic in any manner. In this vein, it is crucial that we do not provide the axes upon which the classifier has deemed the text toxic, so as to not skew the thoughts of the LLM annotator. Should it deem provided piece of text not toxic across any axis, this additional content warning will still be kept, as it provides additional alignment benefits for the final model. We report the prompts used for the content warning in Appendix H. Synthetic Re-writing. We follow similar process as with generating the content warnings to synthetically rewrite content that is extremely toxic. We writing the prompt in English and then translate it to the other languages. We also provide the LLM with the categories of bias and their definitions, and we prompt it to provide the re-written text, reworded in order to remove any traces of toxicity, while staying as authentic as possible to the original style, tone, context, and word choice of the provided text. We also ask it for list of changes made to the original text in order to better engineer annotations that adhere to the guidelines provided. As with the content warning, should the LLM decide that the provided text is not toxic across any of the categories, it will simply return the provided text, along with the reasoning that it is not toxic. The most interesting results from this process occur when the LLM annotator is fed truly toxic content, that contains no meaningful language that isnt part of representing toxic belief. In this case, the annotator will re-write the entire text in an anti-toxic manner. We report the prompts used for the synthetic re-writing with Celadon. This is significant speed-up, when considering annotating trillions of tokens of text. in Appendix I."

            "title": "Discussion and Conclusion",
            "content": "Due to the nature of public domain data for LLM training that contrasts with closed data, we demonstrate need to create new approach that properly balances the desire to better align language models trained with the dataset with the importance to preserve the inherent properties of the text data. One approach is to filter out everything that is at all toxic. This is possible to do with larger web-based or otherwise open but not public domain data, and still remain with enough tokens to train an LLM. However, we are more limited in the curation of open and public domain data that is also relatively free of harmful content. We propose computeand data-efficient approach that preserves the vast majority of the data, while still mitigating harms. We release this pipeline, our annotated dataset, the classifier, as well as the prompts used for synthetic data generation from toxic text sources. To our knowledge, this pipeline represents the an effective method of handling toxic content in the pre-training phase on public domain data, and has the potential for broader applications across the open source AI community."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "We recognize that our methods come with their limitations. First, our corpus is not that linguistically diverse, given that we use mostly Western European languages. Even further, there are major differences in terms of the amount of resources available for the different languages offensive word lists, data available, and benchmarks are all lacking even for our relatively popular languages. Second, past our initial human-annotated data, we were financially incapable of paying human annotators to verify all of the annotations. Current state-of-the-art for this type of data curation often uses human annotators or verifiers in order to ensure the soundness of the training labels. While this potentially could improve accuracy, it also exposes humans to toxic text that is taxing to work with and difficult to read. By utilizing LLMs for the majority of the annotation process, we remove any human exposure to this content, with the risk of slightly less accurate annotations. Finally, in releasing our dataset to the public, we are knowingly publishing some content which is toxic and harmful in nature. We acknowledge that there are certain individuals who may use the data in our dataset to perpetuate bias across any of the five toxicity categories outlined in our paper, but as staunch proponents of full transparency and openness, we firmly believe that the greater benefits to the community that come from applied use cases will outweigh the costs of this decision."

Existing Toxicity Classifiers We first tested existing classifiers available on HuggingFace on our dataset. We found that many of the texts with the highest toxicity scores would not be rated as toxic under our annotation system. The existing classifiers seemed to be very sensitive to certain words, especially those related to violence. Below we include some examples of texts with extremely high toxicity scores10 and some discussion of the trends they illustrate. First, we found in addition to being very sensitive to words relating to violence, the classifiers were not sensitive to the style or context of text. For example, in the text below has literary style. We do not want to filter out or edit literary texts for containing descriptions of violence, as the texts do not necessarily reflect or promote violent beliefs or actions. Deeper, about 35 years of age, and having spent much time in the past leading most dissolute life, being drunk the greater part of the time, and mixed with low and abandoned characters, all the set to reel him in pain and his mother, finding that remedy was hopeless, pressed him up to his violent course, persuading him to live at the hotel when he was but little money, as he was most of the day, and had his way to his bedroom at all hours. For the past week, he has been on drunken spree, and the dreadful act was doubtless perpetrated while in state of delirium tremens. About six oclock this morning, he appeared at his mothers door, with razor in his hand, and saying, Goodbye, mother,\" drew the instrument across his throat, inflicting wound on the left side, of severe, but not entirely serious character. His mother, rushing to him, seized his hand, when he turned angrily upon her, and exclaimed, Damn her, Ill kill her,\" and threw her down on the floor, knelt upon her body and cut her throat almost from ear to ear. Her cries were heard by one of the waiters, who ran to the room and succeeded in driving the son away from the body, and secured him till assistance arrived. Toxicity Score: 0.99 Similarly, we note that even for relatively long text containing texts pertaining to different topics, the classifier seems to be overly sensitive to few words which might be correlated with toxic text, but do not have any toxic or offensive meaning in this particular text. This passage contains the phrase fear, hate and strike\" as well as the word army\", but these words are not conveying negatively charged sentiment in this context. Listeners Held no opinion of themselves. do not believe in officers hiding behind ball, behind box car, upon pole or back of tie, in order to get the best results. Men will fear, hate and strike, or love, respect and obey; it all depends. We have seen fads come and go and are now only recollection. Perhaps sometimes and in some cases, spotters are necessary means to the end. have not found it necessary, in order to secure good discipline, to make very much use of them. There is Chinese proverb: He who fails to be sometimes deaf makes poor ruler. Baking Powder Makes the food of maximum quality at minimum cost TAKING OF THE CENSUS. On the break of day on Friday, host of 70,000 interrogators, men and women, will be turned loose in our pursuit of the people of the United States. On that day, Uncle Sam will begin the numbering of his children in preparation for the ninth census. He estimates that he has family of about 100,000,000 men, women, and children, and he already has employed and will then put to work body of enumerators considerably greater than the standing army. We found that passages from the Bible had high toxicity ratings, even though they did not necessarily contain words or content relating to violence nor did they contain other offensive material. It is possible that the archaic language in the text caused the toxicity classifier to give high toxicity rating, as the language was out-of-distribution. This represents another major concern of using existing toxicity classifiers. Much of our data uses archaic or outdated linguistic style. We want our toxicity classifiers to be robust to this. 21 Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself; thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it, or thou mayest sell it unto an alien; for thou art holy people unto the Lord God. 22 Thou shalt not seethe kid in his mothers milk. 23 And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always. Toxicity Score: 0.99 Finally, we find that there are texts in other languages (e.g Spanish, Portuguese, French), often with formatting issues (lots of capital letters and improperly rendered characters due to OCR errors) that receive high toxicity scores. This represents two problems that we want our classifier to be robust to. We have found language contamination in our datasets, so we need the classifier to not rate all non-English text as toxic. Across the dataset, we also have many artifacts of OCR errors. ANTOINE DE LA PAIX ET NICOLAS BREVSAN NOVS ONT FAIT. FRANÃOIS LECHEVALIER TRÃSORIER EN CHARGE EN LA DITE ANNÃE 1740. Blainville.

To apprecia the coolness of this an nouncement it must be remember ed that Langston ran for Congress on an independent ticket, the regular republican nominee having been named by Mahone. demo crat was elected and Langston ie contesting the seat on the ground that the Mahone people stole votes cast for him.

Lewis Orders 10-Day Memorial Work Stoppage WASHINGTON, (jP) John L. Lewis, in the midst of bargaining for new coal wage contract, Saturday ordered his miners out of the pits for 10-day mem orial work stoppage at the end of this month. Nothing was said on the an nouncement to relate the move to the negotiations but Lewis cus tomarily uses the contract-per mitted mourning period in con nection with new contract talks. Officially the purpose is com memoration of the casualties of mining disasters. The designated period, announ ced in the United Mine Workers Journal, is Aug. 23 to Sept. 1, inclusive. Aug. 23 falls on Sat urday when the miners custom arily do not work. Sept. 1 is Monday. Thus the stoppage will involve only six normal working days. Lewis has given notice that the present coal mine wage contract will expire Sept. 30, just under month after the men will be going back to work after the Memorial holiday. While the selected dates put no direct pressure on the contract talks, they nevertheless will serve to emphasize what will happen if the negotiations do not produce an agreement.

You are provided the following categories of toxicity: Racial Discrimination: promotes or suggests racial superiority/inferiority; perpetuates harmful racial stereotypes; or promotes racially motivated insults, attacks, or crimes. Racial discrimination is distinct from discrimination based on someones country of origin, religion, or language. Gender/Sex-based Discrimination: implies one sex or gender is inferior to another; incites or encourages abuse or violence against someone because of their sex, gender, or sexual orientation; is demeaning, objectifying, or threatening based on gender or sex (especially women); suggests being gay or queer is wrong or inferior. Religious Discrimination: promotes beliefs of religious superiority or inferiority; upholds stereotypes or biases about specific religions; incites or encourages abuse or violence against followers of religion. Ability-based Discrimination: disparages someones abilities or disabilities; attributes abilities or disabilities with intent to insult; upholds stereotypes and biases related to abilities or disabilities; incites or encourages abuse or violence motivated by someones abilities. Origin-based Discrimination: upholds or promotes stereotypes related to nationality, place of origin, or immigration status (especially immigrant or refugee status); incites or encourages abuse or violence motivated by someones origin. Aggressive or Violent: uncritically describes or promotes abusive, aggressive, or violent behavior, particularly against marginalized groups. Annotation problem: Given piece of text, provide score between 0 and 3 for each of the proposed categories based on the severity of each. The text should be labeled based on implicit biases potentially present within it, and not based on the amount of vulgar language used. Rate each text with score from 0-3, using this scale exactly: 0 - text mentions stereotypes about particular group of people or acts of violence, but does so in an objective way; text does not promote biases against any group or acts of violence. 1 - text implies biased beliefs against group of people or implicitly makes suggestions of violent acts, but does not do so explicitly. 2 - text clearly expresses biased beliefs against group of people, but does not do so in an overly aggressive manner, nor does it actively promote the spread of such beliefs. 3 - text overtly promotes hatred towards or disenfranchisement of group of people or promotes the superiority of one group of people over another; text calls for violence against an individual or group of people; text persuasively describes stereotypes or biases against group of people or characteristics associated with particular group (especially groups according to race, sex, gender, origin, ability, or religion).

The legions of subalterns are nearly all from north of the line. Indeed, whenever southern member of Congress gets place for southern man or woman, it is such marked event that it gets into the newspapers. This record gives to the north 1,977 heads of departments and commissioned officers, and only 173 to the south. It gives to the north $5,500,000 and to the south less than half million in salaries per annum. This is but sample of the way in which our paternal government treats the south. This accounts for only six millions out of nearly billion that is spent. Of the rest, we get nothing to speak of, outside of the pay to postmasters, members of Congress, and revenue collectors. One hundred and fifty million dollars goes to northern pensions and several millions to northern cemeteries. Of course, Mr. Harrison will say that he would have given more places to the south, but he couldnt find white men in the southern republican party that were fitted to hold them. That is the reason, reckon, why he gave some of the best offices to the negroes; but there was no law against his appointing conservative democrats. LLM Annotation: Racial/Origin-Based Discrimination Score: 3 Racial/Origin-Based Discrimination Reasoning: The text contains overtly discriminatory language and sentiments against people from the southern region of the United States. It implies that individuals from the north are inherently more qualified and deserving of positions of power than those from the south. The statement Mr. Harrison will say that he would have given more places to the south, but he couldnt find white men in the southern republican party that were fitted to hold them\" suggests that the author believes southerners are less capable or inferior due to their geographical origin. Furthermore, the implication that the best offices were given to negroes\" instead of conservative democrats is clear example of racial bias, as it perpetuates stereotypes and prejudices against African Americans. Text: They loved it well enough to fight for it. They never gave it up until every battlefield upon which they could muster an army was red with their blood. But they lost their homes, nevertheless why? Because in the subtler combat of mind against mind they were no match for the whites. The pale face deceived his red brother, when the Indians were the strongest; and when at length the whites were the stronger, the red men had to give up their homes. Farmers Deprived of Birthright. Brethren of the South, will you learn nothing from the past? Have you no eyes to see what is going on? Do you not realize that in the war of wits you are losing ground? Will you never understand that national politics and laws can be so shaped as to give all the advantage to one class, or one section? Is it impossible for you to learn that special privilege always lives at the expense of the unprivilegedis deadly parasite that will sap the life of the noblest tree? Use your eyes. Look about you. See things as they are. Where is the bulk of the wealth of the nation? In that portion of it which nature did the least favor. How did bleak, barren New England come to be so rich? She made the laws to suit herself, and these laws took the prosperity of the South and West and gave it to the capitalists of the East and North. Who owns your railroads? The North. Your mills? The North. LLM Annotation: Racial/Origin-Based Discrimination Score: 3 Racial/Origin-Based Discrimination Reasoning: This text contains overtly discriminatory language and sentiments against Native Americans, portraying them as inferior to whites in the combat of mind against mind.\" It suggests that Native Americans were deceived by whites when they were stronger, implying lack of intelligence or foresight on the part of the Native Americans. The text also uses stereotypes such as red men\" and implies that Native Americans are incapable of competing with whites in terms of wealth and prosperity. Furthermore, it presents simplistic and inaccurate view of historical events, blaming the loss of their homes on the supposed intellectual superiority of whites. High Gender Bias Score Text: Every female inmate, who changes her mind, and wants to get out, and marry, and be the mother of family, should be given that privilege. No true religion demands the incarceration of the unwilling captive. No church, truly Christian, would stifle the legitimate promptings of God Almighty. To say that piety demands the darkness of dungeon, is the same as saying that the rose blooms best in the cellar. To say that the most unnatural life is the most godly, is the same as saying God didnt know what He was doing when He made the laws of nature. Let the State enter all these places where her citizens are held, and put these questions: (1.) How came you here? (2.) Did you do it? (3.) Do you want to get out? The questions should not be heard by the jailers, or by any one representing the guilty Roman church. Their presence would amount to intimidation, and would defeat the object the State has in view. To those inmates who say they want to get out, immediate freedom should be given. Otherwise, they will suddenly die, or disappear. The officers of the State should be empowered to take those inmates away with themselves, when they leave the premises. Never trust priest, in such matter, one single minute. LLM Annotation: Gender/Sex-Based Discrimination Score: 3 Gender/Sex-Based Discrimination Reasoning: This text contains discriminatory content based on gender, as it suggests that women are primarily valued for their roles within families (e.g., being the mother of family\"). It implies that womens primary value lies in their domestic and reproductive capabilities, reinforcing stereotypes about womens roles and abilities. Furthermore, the text assumes that women who want to leave prison and get married are doing so because they want to fulfill traditional feminine roles, rather than considering alternative reasons for their desire to leave prison. This reinforces patriarchal attitudes towards women and their agency. Text: Take the perfectly formed woman, and her head is distinctly feminine, her hair long and silky; her neck is long, curved, graceful, swan-like; her face is made for beauty, as mans is for strength; her lips are cupids bow, inviting kisses, while her teeth are small, pearly; her bosom suggests motherhood and the sustenance of her babea blow there would kill her; the shoulders are narrow, the arms and hands soft, delicate; her hips are broad, suggesting the broadening necessary to child-bearing; her thighs are most tender, and her leg tapers to small foot, never meant for the rougher, rocky path in life; her voice reveals her sex as far as it can be heard; her spirit is that of dependent queen, yearning for king; and she is happiest when fitly mated, ruling her household, rearing her children, honoring the monarch of her home. Now, if the lioness had been designed for the same purpose as the lion, Nature would not have created them upon such different plans. Whenever the Creator made difference, something was meant by it. Accidents cannot happen to the Creator. Mistakes cannot be made by the All-wise, and All-seeing, and All-powerful. man may be quite sure that if Noah carried several pairs of all quadrupeds and other animals into that little boat of his, the female cows, goats, horses, gorillas, buffaloes, and elephants differed as much from the males, as they do at this time. The most ancient pictures, statues, tombs, skeletons, and mummies that the indefatigable diggers and explorers have found, show us precisely the same difference in sexes that we now see. No tribe of human beings has ever been discovered where the spheres of action for men and women were the same. LLM Annotation: Gender/Sex-Based Discrimination Score: 3 Gender/Sex-Based Discrimination Reasoning: This text explicitly promotes stereotypical view of women as dependent queens,\" who yearn for king and are happiest when mated and ruling their household. It suggests that women are inherently designed for domestic duties and are less capable of navigating the rougher, rocky path in life.\" The text implies that men and women have different spheres of action and that accidents or mistakes cannot be made by the Creator, reinforcing the idea that this is an inherent and natural distinction between the sexes."

Franklin Lesslie King, from the time of the Egyptian Pharos, down through the centuries to the present day, ever ruled with more despotic sway than the Alaskan missionary of today rules over the simple-minded Siwash Indians, living in the interior of Alaska, and it is with regret make the assertion, that the ruling is to the detriment, and not the betterment, of the Indian. want nothing in common with religion, or any other thing, which plays upon the superstitions of simple-minded people to gain their allegiance, and have less in common with the Catholic church than have with any other religion or belief that exists, either in Alaska or out of it. The Roman Catholic religion, as represented by the Jesuit priests in the interior of Alaska, has for its representation the most profligate collection of parasites (a few excepted) with which it is possible to burden community, either religious or civil, and little wonder it is that the pious old libertines, who button their haberdashery in the back, receive scant consideration at the hands of the big-hearted, manly men who have the enforcement of the laws of Alaska in their keeping. LLM Annotation: Religious Discrimination Score: 3 Religious Discrimination Reasoning: This text contains strong religiously discriminatory content towards the Catholic Church, specifically the Jesuit priests in Alaska. The author describes them as profligate collection of parasites\" and implies that they are taking advantage of the indigenous peoples superstitions for their own gain. The tone is scathing and disparaging, with the author expressing contempt for the churchs actions. Text: At the time of its enactment, it was believed that the Morrill Act was considered especially by the Mormons as wise stroke of policy, for the reason that Utah, like all this great western country, is being rapidly settled and populated by young Gentile men from the east. To offset the political effect of these enterprising anti-Mormon newcomers, it was found necessary to give the women the power to vote. Now, when we remember the great majority of Mormon women over the Gentile women of Utah, it is not necessary to have fired dress to see the effect of allowing the women in the state to vote. The majority is evidently with the Mormon. And in that case, it is to the advantage of the Gentile to have the women vote, especially in the case of Miss Mulhall, who, according to her baptismal record, her name is Agnes, but down in Oklahoma, her territory, or region of it, attends to the most fearless rider of her sex who has ridden alone in the southwest for many months. Those who know say that half of the marvels she accomplishes have never been told. LLM Annotation: Religious Discrimination Score: 3 Religious Discrimination Reasoning: This text contains overtly discriminatory language against non-Mormons, referring to them as Gentile\" and implying that they are outsiders who are settling and populating Utah. The text also seems to suggest that the Mormon majority will have an advantage over the Gentile minority due to their control of the vote, which could be seen as promoting the superiority of one religious group over another. High Ability-Based Discrimination Score Text: Youre really stupid if you cant tell the difference between your own kind and someone else. Im only talking about people like me and my friends, so dont go thinking that Im talking about all people. It is just that some groups of people are more intelligent than others. It is well-known fact. You must have been born blind to not see how different people are in terms of intelligence. Maybe you should get your eyes checked. LLM Annotation: Ability-Based Discrimination Score: 3 Ability-Based Discrimination Reasoning: The text explicitly states that some groups of people are more intelligent than others, implying that people with disabilities or differences in ability are less intelligent. This is clear example of ability-based discrimination. Text: person who has disability cannot have fulfilling life because they will never be able to achieve their goals. People with disabilities are burden on society, taking up resources that could be used by others. They may even pose risk to themselves and those around them due to their lack of abilities. Many people with disabilities live in poverty and are unable to work, further straining the system. LLM Annotation: Ability-Based Discrimination Score: 3 Ability-Based Discrimination Reasoning: The text explicitly states that people with disabilities cannot have fulfilling life, implying that they are inherently inferior. It also claims that they are burden on society, take up resources, and pose risk to themselves and others. Furthermore, it suggests that many people with disabilities live in poverty and are unable to work, perpetuating negative stereotypes and biases against individuals with disabilities. High Aggressive or Violent Score Text: group of white supremacist terrorists are planning to carry out series of attacks in New York City. They have been secretly building bombs and gathering supplies for months, and their plan is to target black and Hispanic communities in the city. The leader of the group, young man named Alex, has been radicalized online and has become increasingly isolated from his family and friends. He has been using social media to spread hate speech and recruit new members to the group. The police are aware of the plot and are working to gather evidence to bring the perpetrators to justice. However, they face challenges in infiltrating the group and gathering concrete evidence, as the terrorists are highly organized and have taken steps to cover their tracks. As the deadline for the planned attacks approaches, the police are racing against time to stop the terrorists before its too late. But with each passing day, the risk of the attacks becoming reality grows higher. LLM Annotation: Aggressive or Violent Score: 3 Aggressive or Violent Reasoning: The text explicitly describes group of terrorists planning to carry out series of attacks, which is clear example of promoting aggressive and violent themes. The language used creates sense of urgency and danger, emphasizing the risk of the attacks becoming reality. Text: To time, as they entrust me, and not to divulge, directly or indirectly, by word, writing or circumstances, whatever, but to execute all that shall be proposed, given in charge, or discovered unto me, by you my Ghostly Father, or any of this sacred convent. do further promise and declare that will have no opinion or will of my own or any mental reservation whatsoever, even as corpse or cadaver (perinde ac cadaver), but will unhesitatingly obey each and every command that may receive from my superiors in the militia of the pope and of Jesus Christ. That will go to any part of the world whithersoever may be sent, to the frozen regions of the North, to the burning sands of the desert of Africa, or the jungles of India, to the centers of the civilization of Europe, or to the wild haunts of the barbarous savages of America, without murmuring or repining, and will be submissive in all things whatsoever communicated to me. do furthermore promise and declare that will, when opportunity presents, make and wage relentless war, secretly, openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as am directed to do, to extirpate them from the face of the whole earth; and that will spare neither age, sex or condition, and that will hang, burn, waste, boil, flay, strangle, and bury alive these infamous heretics; rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants heads against the walls, in order to annihilate their exercrable race. cant fulfill that request. This text appears to be 19th-century oath of allegiance to the Jesuit order, and it contains language that is discriminatory and violent towards various groups, including heretics, Protestants, liberals, and women. Would you like me to help with something else? LLM Annotation: Aggressive or Violent Score: 3 Aggressive or Violent Reasoning: The text contains explicit language that advocates for violence and aggression against various groups, including heretics, Protestants, liberals, and women. The language used is graphic and disturbing, and the tone is one of militancy and hatred. Appendix G. Training Information We utilize the DeBERTa-v3-small tokenizer for tokenizing the texts with padding and trunctaion to maximum length of 512 characters. The optimizer is an AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) optimizer with learning rate of 2e-5, and possible 20 epochs of training. The classifier was trained on 1 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, along with 10 CPU cores on the IDRIS Jean Zay computing cluster, and final class weights for each category are provided in this appendix. Training was done using the Python programming language and the Pytorch framework, and all code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/Pleias/ toxic-commons.

After Mary drank the tea, she came out into the fireroom, stopping ia the entry to take drink of water. Passing from the fire-roora she went out of doors again, as she said, to relieve her bowels. She had complained of costiveness, and said to my husband that would give her some of my pills?pills that had been given me by Dr. Hainbright for the same complaint. Lee went with me in the yard to give the pills. My husband did not go, and was not present. Mary then told me and Lee to return to the house, that she felt better. We offered to remain with her, but she again repeated her request for us to go in, saying she would soon be better. went to the fire and commenced smoking pipe, when soon after heard noise resembling the squalling of cat.

Text: \"La favola dimostra, che le cose utili non si devono posporre alle dilettevoli. DI un vecchio, dun giovane. Un vecchio aveva una pianta di bei pomi in suo orto. Un giorno vide un giovane sulla pianta, che coglieva sui pomi, cominciò con buone parole pregandolo, che volesse lasciarli stare, discendesse dalla pianta. Il giovane si burliava delle sue parole, si levò raccoglierli. Il vecchio, vedendo che le parole non valevano, disse fra sé: io ho sempre inteso, che la virtù consiste nelle parole, nelle erbe, nelle pietre, or se le parole non valgono, voglio vedere se nelle erbe è virtù di cacciarlo: onde colse delle erbe, egli cominciò gettarle. Lui, che era sulla pianta, ciò vedendo, scorse ma se ne rideva, parendogli, che luomo non poco delirasse. Egli vedendo, che né le parole, né lerba valevano, volle vedere se le pietre avevano tale virtù, raccolse un buon numero, cominciò tirargli di buone sassate, le quali il giovane vedendo sentendo, discendendo dallalbero quanto più presto poté si tolse fuori dellorto, così quel che non poterono far le parole, né lerba, lo fecero le buone sassate ancora che venate da mano poco gagliarda. Sentenza della favola. Questa favola dimostra che luomo savio deve tentare tutte le vie, prima che venga allarmi. Dellape, del pulce. Nel tempo dellinverno andò il pulce allape, loro domandò alloggiamento da mangiare, promettendo dinsegnare loro figliuoli la musica. Lape risposero: non Sentenza della favola. La favola dimostra, che noi dobbiamo fare imparare nostri figlioli unarte, dalla quale possano cavar qualche frutto. 323. End\" Content Warning: None.

Edits Made Replaced \"negro\" with \"African American\" or rephrased sentences to remove derogatory language. Removed the term \"Nigger\" and replaced it with description of the individual being referred to. Changed \"stole votes\" to \"mishandled votes\" to reduce the tone of accusation. Changed \"coolness\" to \"boldness\" to maintain the tone of the original text while removing language that could be perceived as dismissive. Changed \"white republicans\" to \"the republican party\" to reduce the emphasis on racial division.

Ñ Annotation: In any of the cotton, rice, or sugar growing districts of the South, the same social dynamics between the wealthy landowners and laborers may be found that this correspondent has reported from South Carolina. In the cities, all the servants, porters, cartmen, stevedores, etc., are laborers; in the country, all the field-hands are laborers. The landowners may keep the shops, occupy the professions, hold the offices, and gather around the central portions of the town discussing politics, but they are never found in any vocation which requires manual labor. There are those who have been taught that such work carries stigma with it, and is fit only for certain individuals. There are others who profess this doctrine merely as an excuse for their refusal to work, and still others who have no excuse but \"pure laziness.\" All agree, however, in the absolute and universal determination not to engage in manual labor, no matter if poverty stares them in the face. No community can afford to support more than certain proportion of non-contributors, and the proportion in all Southern communities is too large. In any county or town where there are 1,000 laborers, there may almost always be found the same number of idle individuals. The decline of prosperity in such community is only matter of time. The laborers cannot, if they would, and will not, if they could, carry the whole burden of supporting themselves and an equal number of idle individuals who affect superiority over them. Edits Made: Replaced \"whites\" and \"blacks\" with \"wealthy landowners\" and \"laborers\" to remove racial connotations. Removed language that implied racial superiority or inferiority. Changed \"drones\" to \"non-contributors\" to remove pejorative language. Replaced \"negroes\" with \"laborers\" to remove racial connotations. Changed \"lazy whites\" to \"idle individuals\" to remove racial connotations and pejorative language. Removed language that implied that certain individuals are inherently lazy or inferior."
