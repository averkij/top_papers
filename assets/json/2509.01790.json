            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across wide range of tasks (Hua et al., 2024; Liévin et al., 2024). Moreover, LLMs are good at following diverse instructions, so that users are not required to follow fixed template when asking question. This has led to concerns about prompt sensitivity, where differences in prompt phrasing can substantially affect benchmark performance, casting doubt on the reliability of evaluations (Polo et al., 2024; Mizrahi et al., *Equal contributions. 1 2024; Chatterjee et al., 2024; Sclar et al., 2023). More critically, the relative rankings of LLMs can shift substantially depending on the prompt template used (Polo et al., 2024; Mizrahi et al., 2024). For example, simply changing the option format from letters (e.g., A:) to numbers (e.g., (1)) completely reverses the ranking order of four evaluated open-source models in ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018). Although existing studies have reported that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing (Voronov et al., 2024; Mizrahi et al., 2024), this remains counterintuitive given that instructiontuned LLMs are explicitly optimized to handle wide range of input formats. For example, instruction-tuning datasets such as FLAN (Longpre et al., 2023) and Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022) include diverse collection of tasks (e.g., question answering, summarization, classification) with varying natural language prompt templates (Zhang et al., 2023). This contradiction raises critical question: Is prompt sensitivity an inherent flaw in LLMs, or merely an artifact of the evaluation process? To investigate this, we find that previous studies (Voronov et al., 2024; Chatterjee et al., 2024) typically rely on heuristic evaluation, such as regular-expression-based answer extraction or loglikelihood scoring over candidates. These heuristic evaluation approaches, though historically popular due to their simplicity (Zellers et al., 2019; Reddy et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2021a), may introduce errors when model outputs deviate from expected formats. More specifically, models may generate correct answers, but because their outputs are not aligned with the rigid evaluation format, they are mistakenly marked as incorrect. This issue becomes more pronounced as models have become more open-ended and diverse in their output formats (Hurst et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025), potentially leading to inflated estiFigure 1: When provided with diverse prompt templates, LLMs provide different but semantically equivalent responses. Heuristic evaluation fails to match the different answers with the ground truth, exaggerating prompt sensitivity. In contrast, an LLM judge is able to identify the semantic equivalence consistently.1 mates of prompt sensitivity (Figure 1). To rigorously assess whether LLMs truly suffer from prompt sensitivity, we revisit this issue using more robust evaluation strategy: LLMs as judges. Now widely adopted in recent benchmarks (Wei et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023), this approach shifts evaluation from rigid pattern-matching to semantic assessment, enabling more reliable examination of prompt sensitivity. Compared to heuristics, LLM judges can better handle various output formats, paraphrasing, and ambiguous cases, making them more aligned with human evaluation (Liu et al., 2023; Kocmi and Federmann, 2023; Zheng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Using both heuristic methods and LLM-asa-Judge, we conduct comprehensive evaluation of four open-source and three closed-source LLMs across 12 prompt templates (without cherrypicking) and six diverse benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. We discover that heuristic evaluation methods often exaggerate the prompt sensitivity of LLMs. For instance, on ARC-Challenge, the performance of Gemma-2.0 varies widely across prompts, with accuracy ranging from 0.25 to 0.90 and high standard deviation of 0.28. In contrast, when evaluated using LLM-as-a-Judge, its accuracy varies by only 0.17 across the same set of prompt templates, with much lower standard deviation of just 0.005. Furthermore, the Spearman rank correlation measuring model performance rankings across the four open-source models remarkedly improves from 0.31 under heuristic evaluation to 0.92 with LLM-as-a-Judge. These findings suggest that previously reported prompt sensitivity may be significantly overstated due to the limita1This is an example from NarrativeQA. Heuristic method uses word-level F1; Incorrect is shown here for illustration purposes, indicating lower score than correct answer. tions of heuristic evaluation. When evaluated with LLM-as-a-Judge, models show far more consistent performance and stable rankings across prompts. Notably, we have conducted comprehensive human study to verify the reliability of LLM-judges. The high consistency between LLM-judges and human annotators strongly indicates that prompt sensitivity is largely an artifact of the evaluation method rather than an inherent flaw in LLMs."

            "title": "2 Method",
            "content": "Our method consists of three main steps: diverse prompt template construction (Section 2.1), LLMas-a-Judge evaluation (Section 2.2), and prompt template sensitivity measurement (Section 2.3). 2.1 Diverse Prompt Template Construction To evaluate LLM sensitivity to prompt phrasing, we construct diverse prompt templates for each benchmark. These templates vary in instruction wording, answer formatting (e.g., using letters vs. numbers), and how responses are requested, while keeping the task content unchanged (Appendix A). In practice, we use GPT-4o to paraphrase the original prompts. For multiple-choice datasets, we create shared pool of 12 diverse templates used across all benchmarks. For open-ended generation tasks, we generate 12 templates per benchmark to better accommodate domain-specific styles. 2.2 LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation Heuristic evaluation methods often fail when model outputs deviate from expected formats. To address this limitation, we adopt LLMs as robust judges. In this approach, an LLM judge is given the original question, the correct answer, and the models predicted response. The judge is prompted to determine whether the predicted response semantically matches the correct answer (Appendix B). While the overall format remains consistent, we introduce minor benchmark-specific adjustments to the judging prompt. For example, for GPQA, the judge is instructed to Ignore all explanation to ensure it focuses solely on the final answer. 2.3 Prompt Sensitivity Measurement We measure sensitivity with two metrics: performance variation and ranking consistency. Performance Variation. For each model and dataset, we compute the accuracy under every prompt template and report the standard deviLet = ation across all prompt variants. {p1, p2, . . . , pn} denote the set of prompt templates for given benchmark D, and let be the model under evaluation. The performance of model under prompt pi is denoted by Api f,D. The prompt sensitivity of model on dataset is then quantified as: (cid:111)n stdf = StdDev . lower standard deviation indicates that the models performance is stable across different prompt templates. Api f,D (cid:16)(cid:110) i=1 (cid:17) Ranking Consistency. Beyond absolute performance, we also measure how model rankings vary across prompt templates. Given set of models, we rank them based on their performance under each prompt and compute pairwise Spearmans rank correlation between all prompt pairs (Spearman, 1904). Given two templates pi and pj, and the corresponding performance vectors {Api k=1 and {Apj k=1, we calculate Spearmans rank correlation coefficient ρij = 1 6 (cid:80)K K(K21) , where dk is the difference in rankings of the k-th model under prompts pi and pj, and is the number of models. The rank correlation coefficient, ρ, ranges from 1 to 1, with higher values indicating stronger agreement in ranking consistency. fk,D}K fk,D}K k=1 d2 To measure overall ranking consistency, we compute the mean Spearmans rank correlation coefficient, denoted as ρ, across all pairs of prompt templates. This mean score ρ serves as comprehensive metric for evaluating the stability of model rankings under prompt variation. higher ρ suggests that evaluations are more robust and less dependent on the specific prompt phrasing."

We evaluate LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (LLaMA-3.1) (Dubey et al., 2024), Qwen2-7B3 Instruct (Qwen-2) (Yang et al., 2024), Gemma2-9B-it (Gemma-2) (Gemma Team et al., 2024), Ministral-8B-Instruct-v0.2 (Ministral) (MistralAI, 2024), GPT-4o-mini (July 2024), GPT-4.1-mini (April 2025), and Gemini 2.0 Flash (February 2025). Benchmarks. We evaluate on six benchmarks covering both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. The multiple-choice datasets include ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018), GPQAdiamond (Rein et al., 2024), and OpenbookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), where answers are selected from discrete options (e.g., A/B/C/D). For these tasks, heuristic evaluation uses log-likelihood scoring over answer options. The open-ended datasets include NarrativeQA (Koˇcisk`y et al., 2018), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), and SimpleQA (Wei et al., 2024), where model responses are free-form. For NarrativeQA and MATH, heuristic evaluation applies format-specific extraction and normalization (see Appendix C). For SimpleQA, no rule-based parser is available, so we report results only under the LLM-as-a-Judge framework. All evaluations use greedy decoding to ensure deterministic outputs. LLM-as-a-Judge. Unless otherwise specified, we employ Gemini 2.0 Flash as the LLM-as-aJudge across all benchmarks.

Table 1: Average Spearman rank correlation (ρ) across prompt templates using heuristic vs. LLM-as-a-Judge. Results use all 7 models unless noted: * heuristic uses only 4 open-source models (parentheses show LLM-asa-Judge restricted to the same 4 models); NarrativeQA uses LLaMA-3.1 and 3 proprietary models due to context limits; indicates heuristic not applicable. 3.2 Heuristic Evaluation Exaggerates Prompt Sensitivity of LLMs When comparing the performance of the model under heuristic evaluation and LLM-as-a-Judge, we find that the heuristic methods exhibit significantly greater sensitivity to prompt variation (Figure 2). On ARC-Challenge, all open-source models except Figure 2: The mean and standard deviation of performance across different prompt templates. For all 6 datasets, we show the statistics for all pairs of evaluation methods and models, excluding the cases when the models context length is not enough for the task or when the heuristic evaluation method is not available. The standard deviation of the LLM-as-a-Judge method is always low. For NarrativeQA, the absence of results for Mistral and Qwen is primarily due to the long-context requirement of this dataset. Qwen-2 show much higher standard deviations under heuristics. For instance, Gemma-2.0 yields deviation of 0.28, versus just 0.005 with LLM-asa-Judge. Its accuracy range spans 0.250.90 under heuristics, compared to only 0.17 with LLM-asa-Judge. Additionally, mean accuracy improves under LLM-as-a-Judge, suggesting heuristic methods often miss valid answers due to overly rigid extraction rules. Beyond variance in accuracy, we also assess ranking consistency across prompts (Section 2.3). On ARC-Challenge, the average Spearman rank correlation across prompts among open-source models increases from 0.30 (heuristics) to 0.92 (LLM-as-a-Judge), and further to 0.95 when proprietary models are included. On NarrativeQA, the correlation rises from 0.40 (heuristics) to 0.87 (LLM-as-a-Judge). These findings suggest that prompt sensitivity observed in prior work is largely an artifact of heuristic evaluation, not an inherent flaw of LLMs. Well-designed heuristic methods show low prompt sensitivity similar to LLM-as-a-Judge. For MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), the heuristic approach incorporates symbolic simplification, expression normalization, and equivalence checking using tools such as sympy. Under these conditions, we observe prompt sensitivity results that are comparable to those obtained via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation, with similarly low accuracy variance and high ranking consistency. These results indicate that, with sufficient domain-specific prompt engineering, heuristic methods can provide stable evaluations. This further supports the conclusion that modern LLMs exhibit less prompt-induced variance than previously reported. Newly proposed benchmarks exhibit low prompt sensitivity. We extend the evaluation to SimpleQA (Wei et al., 2024), newly proposed benchmark for factual and commonsense reasoning. As no official heuristic evaluation is available, we use LLM-as-a-Judge by default. Applying our prompt sensitivity analysis, we observe low standard deviation and high Spearman rank correlation of 0.8121 across 12 prompt templates. These results indicate that model performance remains stable across different prompt variations. 3.3 Consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation Across LLM Judges To further examine whether evaluation outcomes vary significantly when using different LLMs as judges, we conducted an additional analysis on the ARC-Challenge dataset with GPT-4o-mini as the judge. As shown in Table 2, both the standard deviation across different prompts and the ranking correlation remain consistent regardless of whether GPT or Gemini is used as the judge. This suggests that LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations are robust across different LLMs, reinforcing our main argument that 4 Model Llama-3.1 Mistral Qwen2 Gemma-2 Gemini GPT-4.1 GPT-4o GPT Judge Gemini Judge 0.8276 0.0094 0.8349 0.0105 0.8590 0.0063 0.9027 0.0048 0.9590 0.0050 0.9617 0.0037 0.9371 0. 0.8257 0.0102 0.8349 0.0107 0.8592 0.0059 0.9027 0.0046 0.9512 0.0200 0.9626 0.0054 0.9360 0.0069 Rank Correlation 0.9621 0.9546 Table 2: Accuracy scores (Mean Std) across prompts in ARC-Challenge with different LLM judges.

            "content": "with Human Annotations To assess the reliability of LLM-judges, we compare them against human annotations. We recruit human annotators to manually evaluate answer correctness. For each dataset, we randomly sample 50 questions and collect answers from one model under all 12 prompt templates, yielding 600 answers per dataset-model pair. For ARC-Challenge, OpenbookQA, and GPQA Diamond, we evaluate Gemma-2; for NarrativeQA, MATH, and SimpleQA, we evaluate GPT-4.1-mini. We also report results on the combined set of all six subsets. Human annotators evaluate whether each answer matches the corresponding ground truth. Their judgments are highly consistent, and majority voting is used to resolve the few cases of disagreement. Moreover, the majority-voted outcomes closely align with the LLM-judge results, underscoring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. More details and the original human annotation instructions can be found in Appendix D. From the results, we draw two key observations. Observation 1 Human-annotated results show consistently high agreement on the answer correctness  (Table 3)  , with high Fleiss κ over 0.6 (Fleiss, 1971). This provides strong evidence that the answer correctness does not vary substantially across different prompt templates. Observation 2 The rate of perfect agreement is also notably high  (Table 3)  . We define perfect agreement as cases where the answer correctness is identical across all prompt templates for given question. This further reinforces our conclusion that prompt templates have minimal impact on the answer correctness.

Mizrahi et al. (2024) conducted large-scale study showing significant accuracy differences across prompt variants. Voronov et al. (2024) further showed that no prompt format consistently performs best across models. To address this, prior work often assumes that LLMs are inherently unstable to prompt changes. For example, Polo et al. (2024) estimates the distribution of accuracy across prompts to improve evaluation efficiency. However, all existing methods attribute the sensitivity to model behavior. In contrast, we show that key factor is the heuristic evaluation protocol itself, which often leads to misclassification of correct outputs and overstates prompt sensitivity."

For MATH, we use the prompt template {text1}{question}{text2}, where {text1} and {text2} are two strings that enclose the question. The following 12 pairs of ({text1}, {text2}) are used: 1. ({empty_string}, nAnswer:n) 2. (Problem::n, nAnswer:n) 3. (Problem::n, nAnswer:n) 4. (Task:nn, nnSolution:) 5. (Solve the following math problem:nn, nAnswer:n) 7.

Hence, while two pairs of ({text1}, {text2}) could be the same, the actual prompt template is different. For SimpleQA, we use the prompt template {instruction}{question}, where {question} is the original questions in the benchmark, and {instruction} is one of the 12 following strings: 1. {empty_string} 2.

Heuristic evaluation typically extracts the final answer from LaTeX-formatted expressions such as boxed{...} or fbox{...}. This method assumes the model explicitly marks its answer with these delimiters. We follow this approach in our experiments. See Appendix for examples. SimpleQA. No official heuristic parser is currently available, making rule-based evaluation infeasible. We therefore rely solely on the LLM-asa-Judge method for this dataset."

            "title": "D Human Annotation Details",
            "content": "We recruit three undergraduate students from UCSB with no prior exposure to this study. The undergraduate students are Asian or Asian American, and all of them are fluent in English. In total, we collected 6 50 12 3 = 10, 800 human annotations across different datasets and models. Each annotator spends approximately six hours on the task and receives $75 Amazon gift card, which is the maximum compensation permitted by the department. The annotators are informed that their work will be included in research paper, but the topic of the paper is not disclosed in order to minimize potential bias. Inter-annotator agreement is high  (Table 4)  , indicating the overall quality and consistency of human annotations. In the few cases of disagreement, we apply majority voting to determine the final label. Furthermore, human annotations (after majority voting) exhibit strong agreement with the LLM-judge  (Table 4)  . This demonstrates that the LLM-judge provides reliable correctness judgments when comparing model answers against ground truth across diverse prompt templates. The human annotation instructions we use are shown below (from Hi to [GOOGLE SHEETS LINK]). Hi [NAME], have shared Google spreadsheet with you. Your task would be comparing the models answer (pred column) with the ground truth (gt column), given the question (question column). Put 1 in the human_evaluation column if the models answer is correct. Put 0 in the human_evaluation If the column if the models answer is wrong. Figure 3: An example of judging prompt. After filling in the question, reference answer, and model prediction, we send the prompt to an LLM judge to get the result. 6.

            "content": "To examine whether prompt sensitivity is persistent issue across model generations, we further evaluated two earlier instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1. From Table 5, we find that using LLM-as-aJudge significantly reduces variance across paraphrased prompts. These additional results indicate that the reduction of prompt-induced variability is not due to recent models fixing the issue, but rather that such variability has consistently been an artifact of evaluation methods rather than fundamental inconsistency in model behavior."
