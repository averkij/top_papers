Introduction What makes good instruction-based video editor? We argue that three components govern performance: data, architecture, and control. This paper analyzes the design space of these components and distills recipe that works great in practice. The result is lightweight model that reaches state-of-the-art quality while accepting flexible inputs. Training-free video editors adapt pretrained generators but are fragile and slow [10, 26]. Training-based approaches improve stability, yet many target narrow tasks such as ControlNet-style conditioning [1, 20], video inpainting [72], or reenactment [8]. General instruction-based video editors handle wider range of edits [9, 53, 64, 73], yet still lag behind image-based counterparts in visual fidelity and control. We set out to narrow this gap. Figure 2 motivates our design philosophy: modern video models already know how to transform videos. To unlock this emerging capability with minimal adaptation, we conduct comprehensive investigation into data curation, architectural de1 catenation and sequence concatenation. Channel concatenation is faster in practice because it uses fewer tokens, but we show that sequence concatenation consistently yields higher edit quality. The trade-off is efficiency versus separation: channel concatenation keeps context short but entangles source and target signals; sequence concatenation costs more tokens but preserves clean roles for each stream, improving instruction following and local detail. Our final design adds small, zero-init patch-embedding routes for the source video and an edit mask used for spatiotemporal control of the edit extent, reuses the frozen video VAE for all modalities, and fine-tunes only with LoRA [16]. Full finetuning can help when massive, heterogeneous data are available, but it risks catastrophic forgetting and is costly to scale. With < 10M paired videos, LoRA transfers faster, reduces overfitting, and preserves pretrained knowledge while supporting later backbone swaps; its main downside is slight headroom loss when unlimited data and compute are present. We inject the mask by token addition, and concatenate tokens from the source and optional reference image along the sequence. This preserves pretraining benefits, keeps token budgets tight (by not introducing new tokens for the mask), and makes the model easily portable to future backbones. Addition for masks is simple and fast; while it carries less capacity than dedicated mask-token stream, we find it sufficient for precise region and schedule control without context bloat. We use an optional reference frame at training and test time to leverage strong image editors when available. References boost specificity and style adherence when present; randomly dropping the reference during training keeps the model robust when they are absent or noisy. Flexible control. Prior work explores control by skeletons, segmentation, depth, and masks. key signal is still missing: when the edit happens. Users often want an edit to appear gradually (e.g., set the house on fire starting at 1.5s, then let the flames grow gradually). We unify spatial and temporal control with single mask video. Pixels mark where to edit; frames mark when to edit, and how the effect evolves. Alternatives include keyframe prompts or token schedules, which are flexible but harder to author and to align with motion. single mask video is direct, differentiable, and composes well with text and optional references. The cost is requiring mask sequence, which we keep lightweight and editable. Combining these design choices results in unified editor, EasyV2V, which supports flexible input combinations, including video + text, video + mask + text, and video + mask + reference + text (see Fig. 1). Despite its simplicity, our recipe consistently improves edit quality, motion, and instruction following over recently published methods. In summary, our contributions are: Figure 2. pretrained text-to-video model can mimic common editing effects without finetuning. This suggests that much of the how of video editing already lives inside modern backbones. sign, and instruction-control. Data. We see three data strategies. (A) One generalist model renders all edits and is used to self-train an editor [9, 53, 64]. This essentially requires single teacher model that already solves the problem in high quality. (B) Design and train new experts for specific edit types, then synthesize pairs at scale [73]. This yields higher per-task fidelity and better coverage of hard skills, but training and maintaining many specialists is expensive and slows iteration and adaptation to future base models. We propose new strategy: (C) Select existing experts and compose them. We focus on experts with fast inverse (e.g., edgevideo, depthvideo) and compose more complex experts from them. This makes supervision easy to obtain, and experts are readily available as off-the-shelf models. It keeps costs low and diversity high by standing on strong off-the-shelf modules; the drawback is heterogeneous artifacts across experts, which we mitigate through filtering and by favoring experts with reliable inverses. Concretely, we combine offthe-shelf video/image experts for stylization, local edits, insertion/removal, and human animation; we also convert image edit pairs into supervision via two routes: single-frame training and pseudo video-to-video (V2V) pairs created by applying the same smooth camera transforms to source and edited images. Lifting image-to-image (I2I) data increases its limitation is weak moscale and instruction variety; tion supervision, and shared camera trajectories reintroduce temporal structure without changing semantics. We further leverage video continuation: we derive V2V pairs from densely captioned text-to-video (T2V) datasets by sampling input clips outside each captioned interval and target clips within it, while converting the caption into an instruction using an LLM. Continuation data teaches action and transition edits that are scarce in typical V2V corpora, at the cost of more careful caption-to-instruction normalization. We collect and create an extensive set of V2V pairs, the most comprehensive among published works, and conduct detailed study of how editing capability emerges from each training source. Architecture. Using pretrained video backbone, we study two strategies to inject the source video: channel con2 clarified design space for instruction-based video editing and consistent strategy across data, architecture, and control that achieves state-of-the-art results. reusable data engine built from composable experts with trivial inverses, lifted high-quality image edits, and video continuation, with per-expert/per-source ablations. lightweight architecture that minimally modifies pretrained video backbone: zero-init patch-embeddings for source and mask, frozen VAE reuse, and LoRA finetuning, plus optional reference frames. Temporal control as first-class signal, unified with spatial control via single mask video that schedules when edits start and how they evolve. 2. Related work Instruction-based visual editing datasets. With the success of image and video generative models trained on largescale text-to-image and text-to-video datasets, recent work has focused on developing datasets for instruction-based image and video editing. Early approaches attempted to build large-scale paired I2I datasets, though with low success rates, requiring extensive automatic [4, 18] or manual [65] filtering. Later efforts improved success rates by leveraging task-specific models [13, 52, 57, 63, 70], leading to highly capable image editing systems [29, 47]. These models subsequently enabled the generation of higherquality paired I2I datasets [51]. Creating paired V2V datasets is inherently more challenging, as it requires editing multiple frames while maintaining temporal coherence and faithfully applying the intended modification. Early work [9] used LLMs and Prompt-to-Prompt [14] to synthesize video pairs, but results were limited by artifacts from the underlying editing method. Another dataset [17] provided videoobject-mask pairs with corresponding captions but omitted edited videos. The current trend is to generate synthetic datasets using one previous general video editing model [9, 53, 64] or collection of more specialized video editing models [73]. These efforts still lag behind image editing datasets in quality and diversity. We discuss strategies to mitigate this gap and provide extensive analysis comparing the effects of different approaches. Instruction-based visual editing. Building on the success of diffusion models for image [12, 19, 28, 39, 41, 47] and video [5, 25, 45, 48, 58] generation, early visual editing methods used pretrained diffusion models in training-free manner for image editing [7, 14, 21, 27, 30, 33, 49, 62], typically manipulating attention maps and latent spaces, or by noise inversion. These approaches generally produce low-quality outputs, have slow inference, and exhibit low success rates. Subsequent work showed that even relatively low-quality paired datasets can outperform training-free methods [4, 42]. Such models concatenate input image latents with noisy latents along the channel dimension and fine-tune pretrained image generator on synthetic paired I2I data produced by training-free approaches. Another line of research performs concatenation along the sequence dimension, improving quality at the cost of efficiency [6, 23, 55, 69]. Similar directions adopt LLM-style architectures for unified or token-based editing [11, 71]. Instruction-based video editing has been explored far less. Early attempts include training-free video editing pipelines [10, 26]. Some works adapt image generative models [34, 43], while others train on low-quality synthetic video pairs and are limited by training data quality [9, 14, 64, 68]. Additional methods include propagating edits from the first frame to subsequent frames [31] or designing architectures with task-specific conditioning for multiple editing tasks [61]. Another line of work explores task-specific editing, such as ControlNet-style [66] video generation [20] or pose/face conditioned human video synthesis [8]. Two concurrent frameworks recently appeared on arXiv, focusing on patch-wise concatenation [44] and LLM-style architectures [22]. In contrast, our method systematically studies different data sources for training V2V models, identifies those most critical for performance, and enables more controllable video generation through optional reference images and spatiotemporal edit control. 3. Method Overview. We build on modern video generative backbone [48] and introduce lightweight conditioning modules for video editing. pivotal design choice is how to inject the source video condition. While one simple approach is to concatenate the source video latent and the noisy latent along the channel dimension [44], requiring only modification of the initial patch embedding layer, we found this method struggles to learn edits efficiently. We therefore adopt sequence-wise concatenation strategy, appending the source video tokens to the noisy latent token sequence. This approach provides more robust and effective conditioning mechanism, as validated in our ablations (Tab. 3). Concretely, we add separate patch-embedding layers for each control signal (source video and mask) and support an optional reference image at training and inference. After the encoding of inputs and patch-embedding, condition signals are injected either by element-wise addition (for the edit mask) or by sequence concatenation (for source video and optional reference image). To preserve the generative priors of the T2V backbone and ensure stable training, we adopt parameter-efficient finetuning strategy. We freeze the original backbone weights and optimize only the newly introduced patch-embedding layers and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) weights added to the DiTs attention layers. We found this approach essential, as full-model finetuning easily led to training instability and source video inconsisFigure 3. (a) Overview of our video editing architecture. The frozen video VAE encodes control signals. Mask tokens are added to the input video tokens and concatenated with the noisy latent tokens and optional reference image. The DiT is trained using LoRA. (b) Input formats used for different dataset types during training. When object masks are available, the spatiotemporal mask input equals the input mask. Otherwise, the mask indicates transitions from the unedited to the edited video. tency. Input video conditioning. As shown in Fig. 3, we adopt simple yet effective strategy to condition on the input video. Given source video and target video, each of shape RN CHW , we encode them with video VAE into latents Zsrc, Ztgt Rnchw. We use separate patch-embedding layers for Zsrc and Ztgt. After applying edit-mask conditioning (below), their tokens are concatenated along the sequence dimension. We place Zsrc first, followed by Ztgt, so the model can learn in-context video editing behavior that resembles video continuation, which is supported by our dense-caption video data. Edit mask conditioning. The mask video RN CHW is binary indicator of where and when to edit the source video. It can specify (1) pixel-wise regions for inpainting or removal and/or (2) frame-wise intervals to control when an edit occurs and for how long, enabling both spatial and temporal controllability. We process the encoded mask latents Zmsk with dedicated patch-embedding layer and inject them by addition into the source video tokens. This addition-based injection is deliberate choice for computational efficiency. Because the mask is low-frequency signal, its information can be effectively fused without appending it to the DiTs input sequence. At inference time, if no mask video is provided, we default to blank masks, treating the task as canonical, instruction-only video edit. Reference image conditioning. We optionally provide reference image during both training and inference. The reference can be sampled from the target video during training. During inference, it can be produced by an external image-editing model by applying it to frame from the source video or provided by the user. Because referTable 1. Summary of datasets used for training. We collect 4.3M open-sourced and licensed data and curate 3.4M data, resulting in total of 8M high-quality data for training.

When present, the reference is encoded with the video VAE and Patch embeddingref, and its tokens are concatenated at the end of the sequence. This preserves fixed token distance between Zsrc and Ztgt while positioning Zref closer to Ztgt for stronger guidance, leveraging off-the-shelf imageediting priors without sacrificing inference flexibility. 4. Data pipeline 4.1. V2V data We propose data generation framework that utilizes various expert pipelines for generating paired V2V datasets. Our approach yields significantly stronger results than only using single general editing pipeline. Figure 4 shows samples of each of our new datasets. Next, we detail the experts. Human animation. Previous V2V datasets [73] lack expert Figure 4. Overview of our datasets. In each example, the left images are inputs and the right images are outputs. annotations ensuring consistent human poses and facial expressions between input and edited videos. To overcome this, we use Wan Animate [8] to generate paired V2V data where the output video is conditioned on (1) the subjects pose in the input video for pose consistency, (2) cropped facial regions for expression consistency, and (3) reference image produced by an image editing model that modifies the first frame to alter the subject or scene. large language model (LLM) generates diverse edit instructions involving actor swaps, clothing and style changes, and the addition or removal of accessories. Object removal and insertion. We construct paired videos by removing selected objects from original clips. First, we apply an open-set object detection model [67] to the first frame of each video to detect candidate objects and generate corresponding bounding boxes and tags. Next, an LLM refines the tags by removing adjectives (e.g., color, material) and scenery-related labels (e.g., road, sky). For each video, we randomly sample fixed number of objects, with sampling probability proportional to the bounding box area to prioritize salient objects. For each selected object, we use video segmentation model [38] to obtain per-frame segmentation masks. video inpainting model [72] then generates new version of the video with the target object removed. Human annotators review the results and discard videos with noticeable inpainting artifacts. Finally, we provide the input and output videos, along with the object category and input video captions, to vision-language model (VLM) [3] and prompt it to generate detailed instructional caption describing the edit. By replacing the source and target videos and corresponding VLM-based changes to the instruction, this dataset is used for object insertion. Actor transmutation. While the human animate dataset already includes high-quality examples of replacing one humanoid with another, general editing model should also support actor transmutation for other categories such as animals. To achieve this, we leverage zero-shot image editing model [27] and build zero-shot V2V pipeline on top of pretrained video generative model [48]. We use this zeroshot V2V model to extend editing types beyond humanoidto-humanoid, including (1) quadruped-to-quadruped, (2) bipedal-to-bipedal, and (3) avian-to-avian transformations. We observe that the zero-shot editing model [27] performs noticeably better when the input video is also generated by the same video generative model. Consequently, for each video pair, we sample two actors from the same category, along with an action and scene, and generate video of <actor1> performing <action> in <scene> . We then apply our zero-shot V2V pipeline to produce the edited version described as <actor2> performing <action> in <scene> . The lists of actors, actions, and scenes for each category are generated by an LLM. Video stylization. general-purpose V2V model should be capable of applying global style changes to input videos. To create suitable datasets for this task, we extract edge maps from input videos to preserve structure and motion while removing appearance and style information. We then use an image editing model [29] to apply an LLM generated style transfer instruction to the first frame of the input video. This edited reference image, along with the edge video, are used as control signals to generate the stylized output video [1]. The style transfer instructions include art movements and styles, lighting conditions, aesthetics, photographic and cinematic styles, weather conditions, traditional arts and patterns, and color palettes and tones. Controllable video generation. Video generation using control signals such as depth and edge maps has been widely studied [1, 20]. The datasets for training such models consist of video pairs that are simple and inexpensive to obtain, making them suitable as supporting data for training V2V models. These datasets enhance controllable generation capabilities and potentially promote emergent skills through data diversification. We include controllable video generation pairs in our training data, using control signals such as depth, HED edge, Canny edge, optical flow, human poses, noisy videos, and grayscale videos. 5 V2V transition data. To supervise how an edit unfolds over time and enable temporal mask control, we synthesize transition effects on top of paired videos src and tgt. Given an edit onset ti, we form training target = [ src ti:tN ] and derive frame-wise mask that t0:ti activates the edit after ti. We then apply transition operators like linear blending to ensure natural transition effect centered at ti. , tgt 4.2. I2I data High-quality instructional V2V datasets are limited, while image editing benefits from mature models and largescale data. To bridge this gap, we train our instructional V2V editor with I2I edit pairs collected from open-source datasets [18, 51, 52, 70] and additional pairs synthesized from VLM-curated imagecaption corpora. From each caption, an LLM produces diverse instruction-style edit prompts; instruction-following image editors [29, 36] generate the edited images. VLM-based filter retains only successful, high-quality edits, yielding instruction-aligned I2I supervision without manual annotation. I2I V2V via affine transformations. Treating an I2I pair as single-frame video is insufficient because it lacks temporal and motion cues. To address this, we convert each I2I pair into pseudo video pair using shared 2D affine camera trajectory. Specifically, we sample smooth sequences of small rotations, zooms, and translations by interpolating between neutral and randomly drawn target pose, with adjustments to prevent out-of-frame regions. The same trajectory is applied to both the source and target images, producing temporally consistent videos that differ only by the intended edit. This preserves the I2I supervision signal while introducing realistic temporal structure. 4.3. Dense-captioned text-to-video data Existing V2V datasets cover object manipulation, stylization, and animation but lack edits like changing human action. As result, instruction-guided V2V models often fail to modify actions effectively. Dense-captioned textto-video datasets [54], however, provide diverse action descriptions at scale, enabling action-centric supervision. To curate T2V data for video editing, given video and caption localized to temporal window [ti, tj] (e.g., he sits down), we slice to form source clip VtiN :ti (frames preceding the caption) and target clip Vti:ti+N (frames containing the caption), where is the frame count used for training. We discard windows that are too long (tj ti ), too short, or contain scene cuts. The caption is then converted into an imperative instruction using an LLM [56] (e.g., make him sit down). This yields canonical triples for training V2V editors: (source video, target video, instruction). Our approach scales efficiently to large captioned video corpora while emphasizing action edits. Qualitative results (Figure 1) reveal that curated action edits enable EasyV2V to perform accurate and complex human action edits. 5. Implementation details We adopt the pretrained video generation model, Wan-2.2TI2V-5B [48], as our base model for LoRA adaption and Wan-2.2-VAE with spatiotemporal compression ratio of 4 16 16. We perform training and report our results based on spatiotemporal resolution of 81 832 480 following Wan-2.1-FunControl. We also provide high-quality results fine-tuned on 811280704 in the supplement. For LoRA training, we set the rank to 256 and adopt constant learning rate of 1e4 with AdamW [32] optimizer. We conduct our training on 32 NVIDIA H100s for our EasyV2V. All newly introduced parameters are zero-initialized. We perform random reference image dropout and video transition augmentation each with 50% probability. complete list of all training data used is provided in Tab. 1. 6. Experiments 6.1. Benchmarks and metrics We evaluate our method on the latest EditVerseBench [22] which has 20 edit types. We evaluate on categories covered by our training dataexcluding unsupported tasks such as camera-pose changesresulting in 160 videos across 16 edit types. Following the benchmarks protocol, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluation using these metrics: Frame and video text alignment. We measure alignment at both frame and video levels using image-text [37] and video-text [50] encoders by computing cosine similarity between (i) each frame and the target prompt and (ii) joint embedding of uniformly sampled frames and the prompt. Preference score. We report preference-tuned image-text PickScore [24] that correlates with human aesthetic judgments, applied between frames and the target prompt. VLM quality assessment. We use OpenAI GPT-4o [47] to evaluate three sampled frame pairs on prompt following, edit quality, and background consistency (0-3 each), providing justifications and total score of 9. In our analysis, we observe that the VLM score aligns most closely with human qualitative assessment so we designate the VLM score as our primary metric for comparison. 6.2. Baseline comparison We perform comprehensive quantitative comparison against diverse set of baseline methods in Table 2. With our primary VLM score of 7.73/9, without any guidance, we outperform not only the previously best published method but also concurrent work and commercial solution. When reference image is given, we can achieve better visual-text alignment performance. 6 Table 2. Benchmark comparison across methods on EditVerse Benchmark. Higher is better for all metrics ().

We provide qualitative comparison with the baselines in Fig. 5. Since EditVerse [22] has not released its code, we take their gallery videos from their webpage. InsViE1M [53] supports only short horizontal videos and often fails to edit properly, producing severe visual artifacts. Senorita-2M [73] depends on the image editor for the first frame and, even with successfully edited first frames, shows motion mismatch and artifacts after the first frame. Lucy Edit Dev [44] supports limited categories of edit types and frequently exhibits motion mismatches. Compared to these methods, our model achieves higher-quality outputs and better instruction following. For example, in the first row, EditVerse fails to produce heavy fog across the whole video. In the second, the tree branch between her fingers remains. In the third, the output lacks visible pen lines. In the last, EditVerse also removes the background trees. Please refer to our supplement for visualizations. 6.3. Ablation study Architecture. We ablate the architecture choice for input video conditioning and compare full model finetuning with LoRA. We evaluate the VLM score for each protocol trained with 20K and 40K steps in Tab. 3. We show that full model training tends to overfit, while LoRA tuning quickly transforms T2V model into V2V model. And EmbedAdd. refers to adopting our patch embedding addition strategy for both mask video latent and control video latent. Technically, this is similar to channel-wise concatenation of source video latent and noisy target latent except for the bias term. However, our results show that this remains suboptimal compared to sequence-wise concatenation of control latents. We also show that LoRA tuning via patch embedding addition performs worse than sequence concatenation. Using I2I datasets. Since generating V2V editing datasets is much more expensive than creating I2I editing datasets, and because strong I2I models and high-quality opensource datasets already exist, we argue that V2V editing models should also be trained on I2I data. simple approach is to treat image editing samples as single-frame Table 3.

To narrow the domain gap, we apply consistent sequence of affine transformations to the input and edited images to simulate pseudo V2V editing pairs. We perform this ablation study by sampling an equal number of I2I and V2V editing pairs and train different models for different dataset compositions. We test performance on benchmark containing 100 videos from edit types supported by both datasets. As shown in Table 4, adding affine transformations improves downstream V2V editing performance, and jointly training on I2I datasets outperforms training solely on V2V datasets. Using V2V and dense-captioned datasets. To examine the effect of data curated by our pipeline, we train different models on various V2V datasets using the same number of training steps. We then evaluate performance on mini benchmark with 10 videos for each edit type. As shown in Table 5, training on each of our proposed V2V datasets significantly improves performance on certain edit types, which validates the effectiveness of our proposed data pipeline. The only exception is our Human Animate dataset, which is outperformed by our Actor Transmutation dataset according to the VLM score. Although both tasks are similar, the latter includes more diverse subjects. However, the Human Animate dataset remains useful for preserving human identities across edits and maintaining consistent facial expressions. Impact of dataset size and generalization to unseen edits. We split subset of our V2V training data to include three edit types only and ablate on training data size with 7 Figure 5. Qualitative comparison of our video editing results with the baselines. 7. Conclusion We introduced EasyV2V, lightweight, instruction-based video editor that achieves state-of-theperformance. First, we propose robust data engines that curate diverse training data, notably by lifting static image edits into dynamic pseudo-video pairs using shared affine motion, supplemented with video continuation supervision from text2video data. Second, we propose parameter-efficient architecture which effectively conditions on the source video, enabling unified spatiotemporal control from single mask with optional reference images. This combination of novel data strategy and minimal-tuning architecture provides strong and effective recipe for high-quality video editing with extensive controllability. Limitations. While EasyV2V is robust on wide range of edit types, common to other concurrent diffusion-based video models, inference takes around one minute and precludes its use in real-time applications. This framework can be naturally extended to support more advanced control Figure 6. Ablation study on training data size and generalization. 10K, 100K, and 1M samples. As training data size increases, Figure 6 shows performance improves accordingly for both seen and unseen edits. We observe that training with only 10K examples already yields fair performance. Moreover, editing capability on seen tasks consistently enhances performance on unseen edit categories, validating that the inherent edit ability of pretrained T2V model can be unlocked with our efficient tuning. 8 abilities. For example, adding geometric cinematographic camera pose controls is compelling direction to further broaden our creative applications. 9 EasyV2V: High-quality Instruction-based Video Editing Framework"

Performance on image editing During training, we occasionally sampled from imageediting datasets and treated each imageedit pair as singleframe video, rather than exclusively applying affine transformations to synthesize pseudo-videos. As shown in Table I, we evaluated EasyV2V on recent image-editing benchmark [60], interpreting each image as single-frame video with resolution of 1 832 480. Impressively, although EasyV2V was not specifically designed for image editing, it surpassed all baselines on nearly all subtasks and achieved performance comparable to leading closed-source and commercial systems. Notably, EasyV2V outperformed EditVerse by margin of 0.54. The model also demonstrated strong results on both action and hybrid editing tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of our unified data pipeline that jointly leverages image-editing datasets and videocaption datasets featuring human actions. Figure presents representative qualitative results, with additional examples provided in our supplementary materials. B. Model configuration B.1. Mask conditioning We compare our mask-conditioned editing performance with WanVACE [20]. Note that as WanVACE is not an instruction-based editing model, we restrict our comparison to the edit types it supports via edit masks: inpainting, object removal, and object replacement. We evaluate two types of edit masks: pixel-wise spatial masks (indicating the edit region per frame) and frame-wise temporal masks (indicating which frames should be modified). While WanVACE utilizes an additional branch with complex context activation and injection for mask conditioning, we demonstrate that encoding masks using the video VAE is simple yet effective, particularly for temporal control."

This is the default strategy for EasyV2V in the main paper. Video VAE, Zmsk + Ztgt: After encoding the mask video into mask latent Zmsk using the video VAE, we perform token addition to inject the mask condition into the noisy target video latent. Downsample, Zmsk + Zsrc: We apply spatial and temporal average pooling to downsample the mask video from input resolution to latent resolution, then perform token addition to inject the mask condition into the source video latent. Video VAE, Seq Cat(Zsrc, Ztgt, Zmsk): After encoding the mask video into mask latent Zmsk using the video VAE, we perform sequence concatenation for all condition signals, including Zsrc, Ztgt, Zmsk, and Zref. To evaluate spatial mask editing, we adopt the VLM prompt from the EditVerse evaluation protocol. To evaluate temporal mask editing, where the edit occurs after certain timestamp, we modify the VLM prompt to incorporate edit timestamp awareness. Please refer to the last page for our complete VLM prompts. As shown in Table II, EasyV2V achieves the best performance when using token addition to inject the mask condition into the source video latent. Both sequence concatenation and our token addition strategy outperform WanVACE on mask-conditioned video editing. From the qualitative comparison in Figure II, we observe that WanVACE [20] has limited ability to generalize to diverse edit prompts and fails to adhere to both temporal and spatial masks in many cases compared to EasyV2V. B.2. LoRA Rank We employ LoRA [16] to mitigate divergence and study the effect of LoRA rank. We train the model for 20K steps to ablate the impact of LoRA rank on the EditVerse benchmark. We observe that performance improves as we increase the rank. We adopt LoRA rank of 256, as performance begins to saturate between ranks 128 and 256. Table III reports the results for ranks 64, 128, and 256. Although the model with rank 256 performs best on most metrics, the gap between ranks 128 and 256 is marginal, and rank 64 is only slightly inferior. This supports our hypothesis that pre-trained video models serve as strong priors for video editing, and that low-rank update is sufficient for robust performance. B.3. Time and memory profiling We profile the efficiency of EasyV2V on single NVIDIA H100 GPU for training and inference under different strategies: (1) full model fine-tuning with sequence concatenation of source and target latents, (2) full model fine-tuning with token addition of source and target latents, (3) LoRA fine-tuning with sequence concatenation of source and target latents, and (4) LoRA fine-tuning with token addition of source and target latents.

Edit prompts are generated by ChatGPT [47] using 150 prompts created from the following instruction: (cid:44) You are helpful assistant to help with the generation of video editing prompts, to edit videos of people. Below are samples of the prompts we're interested it: (cid:44) (cid:44) (cid:44) # Fantasy & Mythical Creatures - \"Make the person look like an elf\" - \"Make the person look like goblin\" # Professions & Archetypes - \"Make the person look like knight\" - \"Make the person look like samurai\" # Horror & Dark Styles - \"Make the person look like zombie\" - \"Make the person look like vampire\" # Animals & Hybrids - \"Make the person look like lion\" - \"Make the person look like tiger\" # Sci-Fi & Futuristic - \"Make the person look like robot\" - \"Make the person look like cyborg\" - \"In the style of Persian miniature # Stylized & Surreal - \"Make the person look like stained-glass figure\" (cid:44) - \"Make the person look like chalk (cid:44) drawing\" # Accessories - \"Give the person pair of sunglasses\" - \"Give the person hat\" Now, generate several prompts per category (cid:44) mentioned above. Actor transmutation. We adapt FlowEdit [27], originally designed for image editing, on Wan 2.1 14B [48] for video editing. As described in the main paper, our prompt assets include three object categories: bipedals (e.g., clown, pirate, ninja, samurai, humanoid robot), quadrupeds (e.g., dog, cat, lion, cheetah, sheep), and avians (e.g., pigeon, duck, parrot, eagle, owl). We provide five examples per category to ChatGPT to generate extended lists. We also compile lists of scenes (e.g., jungle, mountain, beach, street, bedroom) and actions (e.g., walking, running, jumping, dancing). Video stylization. Similar to the prompts for our human animate dataset, we use ChatGPT to generate prompts for video stylization: You are helpful assistant to help with (cid:44) (cid:44) (cid:44) (cid:44) the generation of video stylization prompts, to edit and stylize in the wild videos.

We end up generating 350 different stylization prompts. Controllable video generation. We curate 15K-sample dataset from in-the-wild videos through manual filtering, then apply range of model-free and model-based video-to-video transformations to build paired dataset for training our video editing model. These transformations include human pose estimation (DWPose), Canny and HED edge detection, RAFT large optical flow, random black rectangle masks (inpainting), random black borders (outpainting), depth prediction with Depth Anything V2, grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, color negation, saturation/contrast/brightness adjustments, pixelation, wave warping, posterization, Gaussian noise, and color overlays. Dense-captioned text-to-video data We apply strict filtering criteria to ensure high-quality training pairs from dense-captioned datasets. First, we require videos to have at least 162 frames after downsampling to 15 fps (enabling 81 frames for both source and target clips). Second, we filter temporal segments based on: (i) start time must allow sufficient preceding frames (ti 81/fpsdownsample), (ii) segment duration must exceed 2 seconds to ensure meaningful actions, and (iii) no scene cuts within the segment interval. For instruction generation, we flatten all temporal segments from multiple videos into batches and process them simultaneously with Qwen-34B [56], discarding segments where the LLM returns empty strings (indicating unsuitable actions for video editing conversion). The LLM prompt instructs the model to convert action descriptions into imperative instructions starting with verbs like make, let, or have, while preserving all key details. Image-to-image data We employ multi-stage pipeline to generate highquality instructional I2I pairs from image captions at scale. Given an image caption, an LLM (Qwen3-4BInstruct [56]) generates up to five diverse edit instructions spanning canonical edit types: add, remove, replace, change global, change local, change color, transform global, transform local, text, and other. Each instruction is then executed using instructionfollowing image editors (Qwen-Image-Edit [36] , or FluxKontext [29]), producing candidate edit pairs. To ensure quality, we apply VLM-based filter with Gemma-327B [46]. 13 For I2I-to-V2V conversion, we generate smooth affine camera trajectories by sampling random target poses with bounded parameters: rotation angles in [15, 15], zoom factors in [0.66, 1.0] (avoiding excessive zoom-out), and translation offsets within 33% of frame dimensions. These parameters are linearly interpolated across frames and constrained via linear programming to ensure the transformed bounding box remains fully within the frame boundaries throughout the trajectory. The same trajectory is applied to both source and target images using perspective transforms, creating temporally coherent pseudo-videos with motion cues (zoom, pan, rotation) while preserving the edit signal. With 50% probability, trajectories are reversed to balance zoom-in and zoom-out motions, providing diverse camera movement patterns that enhance the models robustness to dynamic viewpoints during training. D. Impact of classifier free guidance We perform an ablation study on the impact of classifierfree guidance (CFG) [15] during inference. CFG Implementation. Following the standard CFG formulation, we guide the denoising process by interpolating between conditional and unconditional predictions. Given the predicted noise ϵθ from our diffusion model, the CFGguided prediction is computed as: ˆϵθ = ϵθ() + (ϵθ(c) ϵθ()) (1) where represents the conditioning signal, denotes the unconditional (null) condition, and is the guidance scale. This can be reformulated as: ˆϵθ = (1 s) ϵθ() + ϵθ(c) (2) When = 1.0, the model performs purely conditional generation, while larger values of amplify the influence of the conditioning signal. In our framework, we support two CFG strategies depending on which conditions are used for guidance: Prompt-only CFG and Prompt + Reference CFG. Prompt-only CFG. By default, we apply CFG only to the text prompt while keeping all visual conditions (source video and reference image) shared between conditional and unconditional branches: ˆϵθ = ϵθ(cvis) + (ϵθ(cvis, cprompt) ϵθ(cvis)) (3) where cvis denotes visual conditions (source video and optionally reference image), and cprompt is the edit instruction. This approach maintains consistent visual context while allowing the text prompt to guide the editing direction. Prompt + Reference CFG. Alternatively, we can apply CFG to both the text prompt and reference image: ˆϵθ = ϵθ(csrc) + (ϵθ(csrc, cref, cprompt) ϵθ(csrc)) (4) Table V. Effect of the CFG scale for the edit prompt.

Edit prompt: Transform the entire visual style of the video using hand-drawn watercolor animation effect. where csrc is the source video (always present), cref is the reference image, and cprompt is the text prompt. This strategy applies guidance to both the reference appearance and text instruction simultaneously. Our method is uniquely suitable for this type of guidance because the reference image is an optional input to our model. Experimental results. In Table V, we present results under different CFG scales when using only the edit prompt for CFG. We also provide visualized example in Figure III. As shown, higher CFG scales generally improve text alignment but may reduce temporal consistency and video quality when the scale becomes too large. In Table VI, we show results under different CFG scales when using both the edit prompt and reference image for CFG. For fair comparison, we report inference performance only when reference image is provided. visualized example is shown in Figure IV. The dual-condition CFG provides stronger control over both appearance and semantic alignment but requires careful tuning of the guidance scale to balance faithfulness to conditions and generation quality. We observe that the best performance is achieved when CFG scales are between 3.0 and 5.0. We adopt moderate CFG scale of = 3.0 by default with prompt-only guidance. We believe that further fine-grained CFG hyperparameter tuning could yield even better performance. E. User study We construct custom benchmark comprising 160 horizontal and vertical videos spanning 18 distinct edit types, including actor transmutation, add effect, add object, animation, change action, change background, change color, change material, change object, change weather, complex 14 Table VI.

We conduct user study in which participants select the superior sample between outputs generated by two different methods, evaluating them along three dimensions: Instruction Alignment (adherence to the text prompt), Preservation of Unedited Regions (temporal consistency in unchanged areas), and Video Quality (overall visual fidelity). As shown in Figure V, EasyV2V outperforms all other methods across all three dimensions. F. Additional visualization F.1. Robustness to Reference Image We provide visualization results of EasyV2V based on the choice of reference image. By default, we derive the reference image by applying the image editing model to the first frame of the source video. We also present results using the first, middle, or last frame of the source video as the basis for the reference. As shown in Figure VI, our model is robust to the choice of reference image, indicating that EasyV2V effectively captures the identity of the reference image for video editing. Moreover, EasyV2V can rectify inconsistent zoom-in effects and human pose misalignments introduced by the image editing model. Notably, without an external reference image from the image editing model, EasyV2V achieves even better consistency with the source video; for instance, the background remains well preserved. 15 We curate the Human Animate dataset, which contains human-centric video edits, and the Flow Edit dataset, which focuses on actor transmutation edits. We provide comparisons in Figure VII between model trained exclusively on the Human Animate dataset and one trained on the Flow Edit dataset. The model trained on the Human Animate dataset often achieves superior visual details, preserves poses more effectively, and generalizes better to unseen human-specific pose-to-video tasks. Facial expressions are also better preserved when training on the Human Animate dataset compared to the Flow Edit (actor transmutation) dataset. F.3. Exhibition Gallery and Visualization We present additional video editing examples on our visualization website included in the supplementary material. We strongly encourage readers to view the attached HTML file for comprehensive and diverse video results. Capability for Human Action Editing. Leveraging densely captioned video dataset during training, our model demonstrates strong capability to follow text instructions for modifying human actions. Compared to concurrent works, which often struggle to alter human actions effectively, EasyV2V exhibits unique proficiency in such edits, highlighting the effectiveness of our curated human action data. Natural Edit Transitions. Although we employ simple blending transition strategy during training, EasyV2V exhibits an emergent ability to produce natural transitions. We evaluate this using frame-wise temporal masks where the edit is restricted to the second half of the video. We observe smooth and realistic transitions at the timestamp where the source-to-target edit initiates. High-Resolution Results. We train our model at higher resolution of 811280704 to further validate our method and data pipeline. The total training data is subsampled to approximately 6 million samples due to the computational cost of high-resolution training. Note that 81 1280 704 is the maximum supported resolution of Wan-2.2-TI2V5B [48]. We observe rapid convergence within few training steps, confirming that our architecture design with lowrank tuning efficiently adapts T2V model to V2V tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EasyV2V is the first instructionbased video editing model capable of editing 720P videos with duration of 81 frames. G.
