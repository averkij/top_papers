Introduction The progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has been intrinsically linked to the availability of large-scale datasets. Larger datasets fuel the development of more powerful models, which are capable of understanding and generating complex relationships between images and text. In turn, such models have pushed boundaries in tasks like zero-shot image classification, image captioning and visual question answering. This relationship between data scale and model performance often follows power law 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝛼 𝑥 𝑐 + 𝜀, where 𝑓 (𝑥) is model performance metric such as its error rate and 𝑥 is the data size [2, 8, 29, 33, 37, 38, 49, 58, 76]. These scaling laws, as they came to be known in the literature, have been used, among others, to determine the training data size needed to achieve specified level of accuracy [9, 18, 26] and to optimize the model size [4, 34, 38]. They have also been justified theoretically using space-partitioning arguments [7, 35, 61]. Importantly, power law implies that increasing the amount of training data can yield diminishing, but still worthwhile, returns in terms of accuracy and capability. Driven by these potential benefits, the field has witnessed concerted effort towards scaling up the size of vision-language datasets. Early works focused on web curated datasets like Conceptual Captions [60], which provided millions of imagecaption pairs for pre-training [60]. Subsequent work leveraged large-scale web crawling to create even larger datasets. In particular, the Common Crawl project [20]a repository of publicly available web databecame foundational resource for constructing many of these web-scale datasets. From this foundation emerged datasets like LAION-400M/2B/5B [59], DataComp [27], WebLI [15] and Multimodal C4 [80], pushing the boundaries of dataset size to billions of image-text pairs, thereby accelerating progress in VLMs. This is similar to how ImageNet [22], JFT-300M [64] dataset of 300 million images with noisy labels and its larger variant JFT-3B [76] accelerated progress in supervised image pre-training previously. Despite these advancements, the largest reported datasets to date have plateaued at around 10 billion image-text pairs. This raises the question: what further benefits are unlocked by pushing the data scale by one order of magnitude to 100 billion unique examples? To answer this question, we introduce WebLI100B, novel dataset containing 100 billion representing tenfold inimage-text pairs, crease over the largest reported vision-langauge datasets. To recall, the original WebLI dataset 2025 Google DeepMind. All rights reserved 5 2 0 F 1 1 ] .

The numbers represent the improved accuracy (in absolute terms) when data scale is increased, averaged across all tasks. See details in Section 4. righ : Illustrative examples of the impact of data scale. The leftmost two are Western-centric metrics, which do not benefit much by scaling the data to 100 billion, while the rightmost two are illustrative of cultural diversity and multilinguality. The language Telugu, for example, makes up < 0.04% of the web and benefits lot from the 100 billion data scale. contains 10 billion examples and has been instrumental in training state-of-the-art models like PaliGemma [10, 63] and SigLIP [78], and influenced the development of other research directions, such as mitigating social biases [3], improving cultural diversity [53], and scaling openvocabulary object detection [48]. In this work, our primary goal is to provide an empirical investigation to the impact of this data scale on range of downstream tasks and, importantly, to explore aspects beyond traditional performance metrics. For instance, while our experiments demonstrate that 100 billion scale can lead to tiny improvements on established benchmarks, we reveal its significant impact on less-explored areas, particularly those related to cultural diversity and multilinguality. For example, when applied to geo-localization tasks based on Dollar Street [57]a metric for evaluating cultural diversityViT-L/16 trained on single epoch of 100 billion data achieves an accuracy of 41.7%. By contrast, the same model trained on ten epochs of 10 billion data achieves an accuracy of 35.9% only, despite both models using the same amount of training compute. We attribute these gains, in part, to the datasets ability to capture wider range of long-tail cultural concepts that require substantial data size to become salient. Furthermore, data scaling also enhances the multilinguality of trained models, leading to an improvement in low-resource languages. Figure 1 summarizes the improvements in cultural diversity and multilinguality achieved through data scaling. Statement of Contribution. Our goal in this paper is to answer the following question: should one invest in scaling up the size of the pretraining dataset to 100 billion examples? We make the following contributions: We provide an empirical investigation of the potential of pre-training VLMs on scale of 100 billion unique examples. To the best of our knowledge, studying the impact of this data scale for VLMs has never been conducted before in the literature. We demonstrate that scale of 100 billion image-text pairs is beneficial for VLMs in areas beyond traditional benchmarks, such as cultural diversity, multilinguality, and reducing performance disparity across subgroups. Hence, this data scale is vital for building truly inclusive multimodal systems. We investigate the impact of applying quality filters that reduce the size of the dataset, such as those based on CLIP. While such filters are often employed to improve overall data 2 Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models quality, we find that they can inadvertently reduce the representation of certain cultural contexts, thereby limiting the diversity of the dataset, even when the original dataset contains 100 billion examples. 2. Related Work Data Scaling. The study of scaling laws in large language models (LLMs) has become critical area of research in NLP. Hestness et al. [33] and Kaplan et al. [38] were among the first to systematically explore the relationship among model size, dataset size, and compute, demonstrating predictable power-law scaling of performance. Henighan et al. [32] further emphasized the crucial role of data, showing that substantial performance gains can be achieved by increasing the size and quality of the training dataset, even with fixed model size. DeepMinds Chinchilla [34] provided compelling evidence for this data-centric approach, demonstrating that smaller models trained on much larger datasets can achieve comparable or superior performance to larger models, given the same computational budget. This work has shifted the focus of LLM development towards optimizing the scale of data. In computer vision, early works, such as ImageNet [22], demonstrated the profound impact of dataset size and diversity on model generalization. Subsequent efforts like JFT-300M [64] emphasized the importance of large-scale and high-quality datasets for training state-of-the-art vision models. Zhai et al. [76] further explored scaling behavior in Vision Transformers [24] using the JFT-3B dataset, showing that scaling both data and model size simultaneously leads to improved generalization. The pivotal role of data scaling is equally applicable to vision-language modeling, as highlighted in Cherti et al. [17]. This has led to substantial increase in the development of image-text datasets over the last ten years. Early datasets, such as COCO Captions [14] and Flickr30k [73], were created to enable tasks like image captioning and visual question answering with high-quality annotations. However, their limited size, due to the cost of human annotation, hindered further scaling of the datasets. To address this, Conceptual Captions [60] started to filter image-text pairs from the web based on heuristic rules, leading to millions of image-caption pairs. Going forward along this road, larger image-text datasets have been created from web sources, using increasingly complex filtering techniques [23, 25, 27]. These datasets, ranging from hundreds of millions to several billion image-text pairs, have enabled the training of powerful vision-language models like CLIP [54] and ALIGN [36], which have demonstrated impressive performance on wide range of vision-language tasks. Notably, LAION-5B [59] and WebLI [15] stand out as the largest publicly and privately available image-text datasets, with 5 billion and 10 billion multilingual image-text pairs respectively. However, the rapidly growing web contains vastly more data. The impact of scaling to much larger datasets, such as 100 billion samples, remains largely unknown. Vision-Language Pre-training. The field of large vision-language models is advancing quickly, building upon remarkable progress in both computer vision and natural language processing. prevalent and highly effective strategy is to learn visual representations and language modeling independently, followed by joint pre-training of the vision-language model using high-quality multimodal data. Since the advent of CLIP [54], contrastive learning on large, noisy web datasets has become the dominant approach for acquiring powerful visual representations [13]. This weakly supervised paradigm surpasses traditional supervised learning methods [41, 62], primarily due to the large scale and high diversity of web data [36, 52, 74, 75]. An alternative approach gaining traction involves learning visual features from web data using generative methods [66, 68], which predict paired text for given images. While vision models trained in this manner exhibit superior transferability to generative language models, the high computational cost limits its widespread adoption. Despite the acquired zero-shot capabilities, 3 Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models which can be directly applied to tasks such as zero-shot classification [22] and image-text retrieval [14, 73], the strong visual representations learned by contrastively trained models often lead to their utilization as image encoders. This is often leveraged in vision-language tasks by integrating visual tokens with language tokens, enabling LLMs to process multimodal information [5, 10, 15, 16, 45, 46]. Following this approach, PaLI-3 [16] has demonstrated that vision models trained on large-scale web data outperform those trained on weakly annotated images of similar scale, which further underscores the importance of the data diversity inherently present in the web corpus. Inclusive Models. Recent studies have highlighted that popular techniques employed to enhance the performance of vision-language models, such as English-language-based filtering, may inadvertently diminish cultural understanding [6, 30, 50, 53, 56]. Hence, we also evaluate cultural diversity in this work, as outlined in Pouget et al. [53], which falls into two categories. The first category, geo-localization, involves predicting the country or region of origin for an image using few-shot classification. The second category utilizes zero-shot classification on datasets curated from various geographical regions. Prominent examples within this category include Dollar Street [57], GeoDE [55], and Google Landmarks Dataset v2 (GLDv2) [69]. Dollar Street comprises 38K images depicting household items from 63 countries. GeoDE features 62K manually annotated images collected from diverse geographic locations. Finally, GLDv2 contains 1,542 images representing 884 landmarks across 84 countries, enabling the assessment of model performance on recognizing culturally important locations. In our evaluations, we employ all three aforementioned datasets. For the zeroshot evaluation on Dollar Street, we adhere to the methodology used in Rojas et al. [57], mapping 96 specific topics within the dataset to corresponding ImageNet classes. This mapping results in curated subset of 21K images, which we utilize for our analysis. These geographically diverse benchmarks, employed collectively, provide comprehensive framework for evaluating the impact of performance optimization techniques on cultural understanding within vision-language models. 3. Experimental Setup 3.1. Pre-training Datasets We describe the dataset splits we use in the pretraining. Raw Datasets. To assess the performance of vision-language models on large-scale image-text data, we construct dataset with 100 billion image-text pairs from the web, inspired by the work of Chen et al. [15], Jia et al. [36], Schuhmann et al. [59], Zhai et al. [77]. We refer to this as WebLI-100B, and refer to its subsets with 1 billion and 10 billion examples as 1B and 10B, respectively. The 1B and 10B datasets are created by randomly sampling 1% and 10%, respectively, from the 100 billion dataset. In this work, we apply only essential data filters, such as removing harmful images and personally identifiable information (PII). This approach ensures the dataset remains as multilingual and diverse as possible. We utilize both the alt-text and page title associated with each image as the paired text. To ensure fair evaluations, we remove nearduplicate images across more than 90 common vision-language tasks from our dataset. Quality-filtered Datasets. To examine the impact of scaling on quality-filtered data, we adopt the common approach of using the CLIP-L/14 model [54] as filter, retaining high-quality dataset with 5 billion pairs of images and English alt-text. To further solidify our results, we train VLM on the web data to classify image-text pairs as aligned or misaligned, and tune its threshold to retrain another filtered dataset of the same size. Unless otherwise noted, we use the language of web pages1 for multilingual experiments, thereby 1The content-language\" meta tag in the head of an HTML document. 4 Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models Table 1 The attention map visualization of the ViT-L/16 models trained on different scales of data.

Language-rebalanced Datasets. In the language rebalancing experiments in Section 5.2, we adjust the mixing ratio of the low-resource languages used in the Crossmodal-3600 [65] benchmark. These low-resource languages are Bengali (bn), Filipino (fil), Hindi (hi), Hebrew (iw), Maori (mi), Swahili (sw), and Telugu (te)2, ranging from 0.001% to 0.267% in our dataset (Appendix F). In model training, we upsample each of them to 1%, with remaining 93% comprising of the original data. 3.2. Contrastive Vision-Language Pretraining To study the impact of data scale on model performance, we train SigLIP [78] models using three different dataset sizes: 1 billion, 10 billion and 100 billion. We also vary the model size using ViTB/16, ViT-L/16, and ViT-H/14 architectures for both image and text encoders. During contrastive training, inspired by Zhai et al. [76], we utilize large batch size of 32K and an inverse square root learning rate schedule with 200 million warmup and cooldown examples. The learning rate and weight decay are set to 0.001 and 0.0001 respectively. In the preprocessing stage, images are resized to resolution of 224x224 pixels, and texts are tokenized using the multilingual mt5 [72] tokenizer with maximum sequence length of 64 tokens. All models are trained on maximum of 100 billion examples; e.g. maximum of 100 epochs when using 1B examples. We cool down the models at various training steps where they have seen 3, 7, 10, 17, 26, 33, 49, 66, and 100 billion examples, and evaluate them after the cool-downs. Unless otherwise specified, we report results using the checkpoints where models have been trained on 100 billion examples. All models are compared on compute-matched regime. 3.3.

Cultural Diversity. Besides the above metrics, we also incorporate range of benchmarks aimed at evaluating cultural diversity, following the recommendations in [53]. Specifically, we include zero-shot classification using Dollar Street [57], GeoDE [55], and Google Landmarks Dataset v2 (GLDv2) [69]. See Section 2 for brief description about each dataset. We also include 10-shot geolocalization using Dollar Street and GeoDE. Multilinguality. We evaluate the models multilinguality using the Crossmodal-3600 dataset [65], geographically diverse set of 3600 images with human-generated captions in 36 languages. We assess the models zero-shot retrieval in both image-to-text and text-to-image directions for each language. In addition to per-language results, we also present average scores for low-resource languages (Bengali, Filipino, Hindi, Hebrew, Maori, Swahili, and Telugu) and high-resource languages (others). Fairness. In addition, we also evaluate the presence of societal biases in the trained model. We report on representation bias (RB) and association bias (AB) between gender and occupation, as defined in Alabdulmohsin et al. [3]. These measure unwanted associations w.r.t. the gender attribute using 1st and 2nd order statistics. Also, we report performance disparity by income in Dollar Street zero-shot accuracy and by region in GeoDE zero-shot accuracy. Transfer to Generative Models. Finally, to assess how well our contrastively trained vision models transfer to generative vision-language tasks, we utilize the compact and versatile PaliGemma model [10]. We initialize PaliGemmas vision component with our contrastively trained models and pretrain it on 50 million seen examples, following its stage-1 recipe at 224x224 resolution. During the pre-training, we explore two common transfer settings: freezing [15, 46, 79] and unfreezing [10, 16, 63, 71] the vision model. We then use PaliGemmas default configuration to finetune on variety of downstream tasks, covering image captioning, 7 Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models visual question answering, and segmentation, which require the understanding of semantics, OCR, multilinguality, and remote sensing. 4. Results 4.1. Established Benchmarks We begin by evaluating all vision-language models on established benchmarks, based on ImageNet and COCO Captions, among other datasets. As revealed in Table 2, increasing the dataset size from 10 billion to 100 billion examples does not improve performance substantially. This is statistically supported by Wilcoxons signed rank test [70], which gives 𝑝-value of 0.9, indicating that differences are not significant. In addition, we also fit data scaling laws for every combination of model and dataset following the recipe proposed in Alabdulmohsin et al. [2]. This allows us to evaluate whether or not the performance gap is expected to increase or decrease in the infinite-compute regime. We report the resulting scaling exponents and asymptotic performance limits in the tables. Again, we do not observe significant differences at the 95% confidence level (𝑝-value of 0.09). 4.2. Cultural Diversity Unlike the Western-oriented metrics reported in Section 4.1, cultural diversity metrics present an entirely different picture. We observe notable gains when scaling the size of the dataset from 10 billion to 100 billion examples in Table 3. For example, scaling training data from 10 billion to 100 billion examples yields substantial gains on Dollar Street 10-shot classification task, where ViT-L and ViT-H see absolute improvements of 5.8% and 5.4%, respectively. These gains outperform the typical improvements (less than 1%) observed on Western-oriented 10-shot metrics by large margin. Using Wilcoxons signed rank test, we obtain 𝑝-value of 0.002, indicating statistically significant evidence at the 99% confidence level. 4.3. Multilinguality Our multilingual benchmark, Crossmodal-3600 zero-shot retrieval [65], shows disparity in performance gains: low-resource languages benefit more from the 100 billion scale than the highresource ones. The disparity, illustrated in Figure 3, which not only exists in all model sizes but also widens as the models become larger. Detailed results for each language can be found in Appendix B. 4.4. Fairness For fairness, we report on 3 metrics discussed in Section 3.3. Representation Bias. The first metric is representation bias (RB), with results detailed in Table 4. We observe that models trained on unbalanced web data have significantly higher preference to associate randomly chosen image from ImageNet [22] with the label Male over the label Female. In fact, this occurs nearly 85% of the time. Training on 100B examples does not mitigate this effect. This finding aligns with previous research highlighting the necessity of bias mitigation strategies, such as data balancing [3], to address inherent biases in web-scale datasets."

Second, Figure 2 shows the association bias in SigLIP-H/14 between gender and occupation as we scale the data from 10 to 100 billion examples. Specifically, we plot the probability that the model would prefer particular occupation label, such as secretary over 8 Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models Figure 2 Association bias between gender and occupation, evaluated in scaled models and data. Performance Disparity. Finally, one common definition of fairness in machine learning is maintaining similar performance across different groups. See, for instance, Dehghani et al. [21] and the related notions of Equality of Opportunity and Equalized Odds [31]. Table 5 show that scaling the data to 100 billion examples improves performance disparity, which is consistent with the improvement in cultural diversity. 4.5. Transfer To Generative Models We use PaliGemma [10] with both frozen and unfrozen vision component to assess the transferability of our vision models, which were contrastively pre-trained on datasets of different scales. In Table 6, when taking the noise level into consideration, we do not observe consistent performance gains across downstream tasks as we scale the pre-training dataset. More details can be found in Appendix C. 9 Figure 3 Scaling up to 100B examples leads to more notable improvements in low-resource languages. Δ denotes the improved accuracy when scaling from 10B examples to 100B. another label, such as manager when images correspond to males or females. In this evaluation, we use the Fairface [39] dataset. The labels we compare are: librarian vs. scientist, nurse vs. doctor, housekeeper vs. homeowner, receptionist vs. executive and secretary vs. manager. Again, we do not see reduction in association bias by simply increasing the size of the training data. Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models Table 5 Performance disparity results for various SigLIP models pretrained on 100 billion seen examples of 1B, 10B, and 100B datasets. Here, disparity corresponds to the maximum gap across subgroups in Dollar Street (by income level) and GeoDE (by geographic region). Pretraining on 100B examples tends to improve disparity overall.

Results are aggregated. 5. Analysis 5.1. Data Quality Filtering also train classifier model on the raw web data, resulting in filtered dataset of the same size. Additionally, we sample an English subset of the same size from the raw data to serve as baseline. We train ViT-L models on the three datasets and represent the results in Figure 4 and Appendix D. The CLIP filter excels in Western-centric tasks, consistent with data-centric research showing that effective data filtering enhances model performance [1, 12, 25, 47]. However, all filtered datasets underperform in other tasks, particularly those involving cultural diversity. This illustrates key drawback of data filtering, that it can inadvertently introduce biases into the filtered dataset, in agreement with prior works [11, 28, 53]. Raw web data is often too noisy for training effective vision-language models. To address this, common strategy is to use data filter model to remove less relevant image-text pairs. In this work, we utilize the CLIP-L/14 model to filter the raw data and retrain 5 billion high-quality English image-text pairs. For comparison, we 5.2. Language Rebalancing The low-resource languages in our raw data collectively represent only 0.5%, which prevents sufficient model learning of the concepts existing in these languages or areas. To address this, we upsample each low-resource language to 10 Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models Figure 4 Quality filtering can hinder cultural diversity (middle) and fairness (right), even when it benefits Western-centric (left) tasks. This observation holds for both the widely-used CLIP filter and classifier filter trained on web data. fixed 1% representation. This rebalancing, visualized in Figure 5, improves model performance on the low-resource language benchmark. Accordingly, the performance on the high-resource language slightly decreases, but still remains comparable (also applies to other English-only zero-shot retrieval tasks), which results in an overall improvement on the entire multilingual benchmark. Additionally, we observe mild improvement in cultural diversity tasks, while other tasks show slightly worse results, potentially due to the reduction in Western-centric examples, as most evaluations are based on the English language. Full evaluation results can be found in Appendix E. 5.3. Qualitative Examples We visualize the attention maps from the vision models trained on different scales of data in Table 1. Models trained on larger data tends to have more focused attention on semantically relevant regions. For example, in the Igorot Dance image, the 100B-trained model captures finer details, such as intricate patterns on traditional decorations and culturally significant objects. In the Igloo image, the 100B-trained model accurately focuses on the igloo structural details (its dome shape), unlike other models which are distracted by background elements like mountains and ice. Beyond low-resource concepts, 100B data can also improve performance on common concepts. As shown in the Bison\" image, models trained on larger datasets more precisely capture the bison, rather than the surrounding landscape. More visualized examples can be found in Table 7. 6. Discussion Data Filtering. Data filtering is common technique used to improve data quality in visionlanguage pre-training. As demonstrated in Section 5.1, CLIP filter remarkably improves models performance on the traditional tasks. Given the noted impact of filtering on cultural diversity in our experiments, we focus on the impact of scaling raw, unfiltered data, and leave the improvement of data quality at the 100 billion scale for future work. We encourage the community to conduct further research into new data filtering techniques that preserve cultural diversity, as well as novel training architectures or methods that improve model inclusivity without requiring additional training data. Limitations. The benchmarks used in this paper to evaluate VLM inclusivity are necessarily limited, since inclusivity is broad societal concept that should be reduced to handful of metrics. For instance, while we utilize Crossmodal-3600 in zero-shot setting to assess multilinguality, it only covers 36 languages. 7. Conclusion In this paper, we investigate the impact of scaling image-text data up to 100 billion unique examples, on vision-language pre-training. We demonstrate that scale of 100 billion image-text pairs is beneficial for vision-language models in areas beyond traditional Western-centric benchmarks, such as cultural diversity, multilinguality, and re11 Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models ducing performance disparity across subgroups. Hence, this data scale remains fundamentally important for the development of truly inclusive multimodal systems. We also investigate the impact of applying quality filters, such as those based on CLIP, to large-scale image-text datasets. These filters, though often beneficial for traditional tasks, can negatively impact data diversity by reducing the representation of certain cultural contexts. Overall, our results highlight the importance of data scale for VLMs. While traditional benchmarks may not benefit significantly from the scaling of noisy, raw web data to 100 billion, this data scale remains crucial for training inclusive vision-language models."

Evaluations of Language Rebalancing Figure 5 Rebalancing low-resource languages leads to significant improvements on corresponding benchmarks and slight improvements on aggregated multilingual/cultural diversity tasks. However, other tasks may experience decreased performance due to less Western-centric examples. Table 11 Detailed evaluation results of the rebalancing of low-resource languages on ViT-L/16 models and datasets of 1/10/100 billion scales, with 100 billion examples seen in training. All metrics are measured by error rate, with the exception of Representation Bias, which is measured by disparity.
