            "content": "103 3 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have greatly changed human life. LLMs are seen as the next technological singularity and proved to surpass human performance in many areas [Phan et al., 2025], significantly improving work efficiency. However, the measurement of LLMs accessibility on various real-world professionalism remains an unresolved issue, especially in the long-tailed fields with less attention, such as light industry, agriculture, and various service-related disciplines. Many popular benchmarks, such as MMLU [Hendrycks et al., 2020], GPQA [Rein et al., 2023], and MMLU-pro [Wang et al., 2024b], evaluate LLMs abilities across different fields, while mainly focus on common fields like mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and law, limiting these benchmarks practical significance on many real-world professionalisms. These benchmarks fail to cover the diverse and long-tail knowledge accumulated by humans. Moreover, large language models have achieved very high scores on these benchmarks, making them lose their value as challenging frontiers. To address the gap, we introduce SuperGPQA, comprehensive evaluation at the boundaries of human knowledge covering the evaluation of 285 graduate-level disciplines knowledge and reasoning capacities. SuperGPQA provides at least 50 questions for each graduate-level disciplines to guarantee its accessibility on various real-world professionalism. SuperGPQA is developed by large-scale human-LLM collaboration system, with crowd-sourcing annotators, experts, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs participating in, and then verified by rigorous 3-stage quality inspection process, to guarantee its reliability. Moreover, SuperGPQA is qualified as challenging frontier for SOTA reasoning LLMs, instruct LLMs, and base LLMs, where the best LLMs (e.g., o1 and Deepseek-R1) only achieve score of around 60. For building SuperGPQA, we propose large-scale human-LLM collaboration system and share the valuable lessons learned in the paper. We divide the annotation system of SuperGPQA into three major stages: Source Screening, Transcription, and Quality Inspection. During the source screening stage, expert annotators collect credible resources of different disciplines questions to guarantee the reliability and difficulty of the raw questions. During the transcription stage, crowd-sourcing annotators are asked to revise or translate the raw questions to multiple-choice questions, generate complementary confusion options, and estimate the difficulty and reliability of these questions. Crowd-sourcing annotators estimate the difficulty and reliability of candidate questions based on both expert judgments and the accuracy of LLMs responses during 4 the annotation process. Crowd-sourcing annotators, rigorous real-time plagiarism checks with existing candidate questions, and robust filtering system based on SOTA LLMs are adopted in the transcription stage to reduce the waste of funding and expert manpower. During the quality inspection stage, we adopt rigorous three-stage quality inspection process: We select suspicious candidate questions based on checklist of LLMs responses. Expert annotators review the suspicious candidate questions with unrestricted access to the web and revise these questions. The easy questions are further tailored based on the accuracy of LLMs responses to guarantee the discrimination of SuperGPQA. We share several major insights based on the evaluation results of SuperGPQA: Reasoning capacities matter. The reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o1-202412-17) achieve the best performance in SuperGPQA. Instruction tuning is very helpful. For example, the results (47.40, 40.75) of DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct are better than the results (32.14, 34.33) of DeepSeek-V3-Base and Qwen2.5-72B lot, respectively. More powerful LLMs lead to more balanced results. On different difficulties. the results of simple, middle, and hard splits of DeepSeek-R1 are 63.59, 63.63, and 56.87. In contrast, the results of easy, middle, and hard splits of Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct are 44.82, 37.90, and 19.97. Models are better in newer versions. For example, the results of GPT-4o-2024-1120, GPT-4o-2024-08-06, and GPT-4o-2024-05-13 are 44.40, 41.64, and 39.76, respectively. 2. Data Collection We solicit difficult questions from well-educated experts and crowd-sourcing annotators, where we consider experts as individuals having or pursuing PhD, as in GPQA [Rein et al., 2023], and crowd-sourcing annotators as undergraduates and master students from top-tier Chinese universities, i.e.mainly from Tsinghua University, Peking University, Zhejiang University, Beihang University, and Chinese Academy of Sciences. Figure shows the three major stages of SuperGPQAs data collection pipeline: Source Screening, Transcription, and Quality Inspection, which are separately detailed in subsection 2.1, 5 subsection 2.2, and subsection 2.3. First, experts select credible resources of different disciplines questions. Second, crowd-sourcing annotators revise the raw questions from credible resources to candidate questions. Finally, rigorous human-LLM collaboration quality inspection process is adopted to select difficult and reliable questions from candidate questions. Figure 2. Data Collection Process of SuperGPQA. 2.1. Source Screening Lessons: Crowd-Sourcing Annotators are not capable of collecting credible resources for multiple-choice question annotation with high expertise requirements. The questions and answers (QAs) on exercise websites are not always reliable, even sometimes these QAs are claimed verified. Multiple-choice questions modified from calculation and reasoning problems usually are more discriminatory than the original multi-choice questions available online. During the source screening stage, only expert annotators are allowed to collect credible resources of different disciplines questions to guarantee the reliability and difficulty of the raw questions. In the early stage of collecting candidate questions of SuperGPQA, we trust crowd-sourcing annotators to collect credible resources themselves. 6 However, the candidate questions based on the resources found by the crowd-sourcing annotators are always judged too easy or unreliable by expert annotators. As result, significant portion of early funding is wasted on ineffective questions annotated by crowd-sourcing annotators. Additionally, we point out that QAs on exercise websites are not always reliable. In the early stage of SuperGPQA collection process, some annotators, even expert annotators, trust exercise websites that serve as corroboration of their reasoning process and answers. In the subsequent quality inspection stage, this proved to be costly mistake, leading us to spend significant amount of time and cost correcting erroneous answers derived from online exercise websites. Furthermore, we find that many SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-4o, o1-mini, and Gemini-flash, exhibit high frequency of consistency in both process and answers with the erroneous processes and answers from several online exercise websites. The observations reveal that the reliability of the solutions provided by online exercise websites is limited and there is significant risk of data leakage. Expert annotators are asked to provide raw questions from credible resources with screenshot for further annotation in the source screening stage. The screenshot greatly eases the workload of quality inspection. We observe that the efficiency of quality inspection is greatly improved with the source screenshot provided. The priority order for selecting original questions is: Example problems with solutions from textbooks. Calculation and reasoning-needed questions with solutions from websites. Reasoning-needed multiple-choice questions with solutions from websites. General multiple-choice questions with solutions from websites. Questions only with answers but deemed correct by expert annotators. sampled list of credible resources certified by expert annotators is provided in Appendix and Appendix for reference. 7 Figure 3. Rewriting Samples of Questions Requiring the Selection of Correct or Incorrect Options. 2.2. Transcription Lessons: Crowd-sourcing annotators have low accuracy in judging generated distractors. For question types like selecting correct or incorrect options, it is easy to generate flawed distractors, requiring unified rewriting at this stage. During the transcription stage, crowd-sourcing annotators are asked to revise the original questions into candidate questions. Specifically, the following operations are performed: Translate non-English questions into English with academic language. Convert non-multiple-choice questions into multiple-choice format. Standardize the rewriting of questions requiring the selection of correct or incorrect statements, as shown in Figure 3. Include region-specific information where necessary, such as specifying the country for laws mentioned in the questions, except for universally accepted rules. The questions requiring the selection of correct or incorrect statements must be standardized as shown in Figure 3. Because we notice that even SOTA LLMs, e.g. Claude-3.5Sonnet, GPT-4o-0806, suffer from generating correct suitable confounders for questions 8 requiring the selection of correct or incorrect statements. The full transcription tutorial is provided in Appendix B. 2.3. Quality Inspection Lessons: Questions where LLMs choose the same incorrect option are highly suspicious. Cases where multiple or all SOTA LLMs make the same error often indicate that the LLMs have memorized explanations from incorrect exercise websites, based on SOTA LLMs responses. We refer to the data quality inspection and filtering methods used in LIME and MMLU-Redux Zhu et al. [2024], Gema et al. [2024], Wu et al. [2024], etc. The quality inspection process consists of three substages: Rule-based Quality Inspection, LLMbased Quality Inspection, and Expert-based Quality Inspection. Candidate questions with clear formatting issues are identified and filtered out by rule-based quality inspection. The full checklist of rule-based quality inspection refers to subsection C.1. We then adopt several SOTA LLMs to generate responses and additional tags to these reserved candidate questions. LLM-based quality inspection includes validity checks, negative and extreme inquiry detection, multimodal exclusion, field relevance evaluation, completeness assessment, and discrimination tagging based on SOTA LLMs responses. It provides an estimation of not only the correctness but also the discrimination of the candidate questions. Finally, we ask the expert annotators to re-annotate the suspicious candidate questions. The checklist for selecting suspicious candidate questions refer to subsection C.2. We adopt GPT-4o-2024-08-06, Gemini-2.0-flash, Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-250115, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as SOTA LLMs for selecting suspicious candidate questions. During the re-annotation process, following the rules stated in GPQA [Rein et al., 2023], expert annotators are asked to review and solve the given candidate questions with unrestricted access to the web. They spend over 30 minutes on each candidate question according to the post-annotation interview. The tutorial for manual quality review refers to subsection C.3. 3. Statistics Discipline #Num.

Statistics of SuperGPQA. Tokens are calculated with Tiktoken using cl100k_base encoding. We propose SuperGPQA, designed as comprehensive benchmark to probe the upper bounds of state-of-the-art Large Language Models capabilities. With 26,529 questions spanning 13 disciplines, 72 fields, and 285 subfields, it substantially surpasses existing benchmarks in both scale and taxonomic depth. Compared to similar hard benchmarks such as GPQA (448 questions) and MMLU-Pro (12,032 questions), SuperGPQA not only contains larger question pool but also features more challenging format with an average of 9.67 options per question, significantly higher than the conventional 4-option format (e.g., MMLU). Comprehensiveness and Discrimination. As revealed in Table 1, the distribution of questions across disciplines reveals notable concentration in STEM fields, with Science (9,838 questions), Engineering (7,892 questions), and Medicine (2,755 questions) collectively accounting for 77.2% of the benchmark. While this distribution might appear uneven at first glance, it emerges from our rigorous question collection and validation process. During the data annotation phase, we source comparable number of reference books for each of the 285 subfields (the subfields are detailed in Table 2 and 10 Discipline Agronomy(485) Economics(873) Education(484) Engineering(7892) Field : Subfield Animal Husbandry(103) : Animal Nut. & Feed Sci.; Animal Rear. & Breed.

Table 3 and the reference sources in Table 11, Appendix and Appendix I. However, the STEM disciplines yielded more questions meeting our stringent quality and difficulty criteria aforementioned in section 2, where the questions and options are filtered through rigorous rule-based, model-based and human-based pipeline. This natural emergence of STEM-heavy distribution aligns with the benchmarks goal of probing LLMs upper-bound capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. Despite the relatively smaller representation of non-STEM disciplines (e.g., Philosophy: 347, Literature: 1,676, History: 674 questions), our experiments demonstrate that these subsets effectively discriminate various SOTA LLMs performance levels (detailed in subsection 4.2). This once again validates the discriminative power of our benchmark across all domains, regardless of sample size. Difficulty. The difficulty distribution across disciplines  (Table 4)  reveals varying levels of complexity. In STEM fields, we observe more balanced distribution of difficulty levels. For instance, Engineering questions are distributed as 31.1% hard, 43.9% middle, and 25.0% easy, while Science shows 42.8% hard, 42.0% middle, and 15.2% easy. NonSTEM disciplines generally show different pattern, with higher proportion of easy and middle-difficulty questions. Notably, 42.33% of all questions require mathematical calculations or formal reasoning, with Science (66.34%) and Engineering (55.40%) showing the highest calculation rates. Difficulty Agro. Econ.

Distribution of Difficulty Levels Across Disciplines. #N denotes the number of samples. Sentence Length. Question and answer length analysis reveals substantial variation across disciplines. The average question length is 58.42 tokens, with Literature questions showing the highest maximum length (869 tokens) and Engineering questions averaging 67.26 tokens. The answer options maintain length pattern similar to the general options across different disciplines, averaging 12.86 tokens per option. Such consistent 13 Figure 4. The Visualization of the Text Embeddings of Question-Answer Pairs Across Disciplines. length distribution across options aligns with one of the requirements of error option curation, which tries to confuse the models by providing confusing options in similar lengths. Semantic Visualization. As shown in Figure 4, we employ t-SNE visualization of question-answer pair embeddings to visualize the distribution SuperGPQA1 and to further show the comprehensiveness of it. The resulting visualization demonstrates clear clustering patterns across disciplines while maintaining substantial overlap in conceptual spaces. The Engineering and Science demonstrate the highest degree of embedding overlap, suggesting strong semantic similarities in their Q&A patterns. The humanities cluster (Literature, Philosophy, History) shows diffuse boundaries but maintains distinct centroids. The Military Science exhibits relatively isolated embedding patterns, indicating unique domain-specific language. This analysis shows aligning 1We use the gte-large-en-v1.5 [Li et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2024b] encoding model and set the t-SNE parameters as: perplexity 100, learning rate 500, and 1000 iteration. For clearer visualization, we randomly select maximum 1000 samples from each disciplines. 14 Figure 5. The Correlation Coefficients between Different Benchmarks. For MMLU, we record the results under the 5-shot setting. conclusions from Figure 6 and reveals that the semantic structure of the SuperGPQA pairs reflects both the traditional organization of academic disciplines and their natural intellectual relationships, effectively capturing both domain-specific knowledge and cross-disciplinary connections. Figure 6. The Correlation Between Disciplines in SuperGPQA. 15 4. Experiments 4.1. Baseline Models We evaluate 6 reasoning models (o3-mini has three modes), 28 chat models and 17 base models on SuperGPQA, which includes closed-source models, open-source models, and fully open-source models. The reasoning models include Deepseek-R1 and DeepseekR1-Zero [Guo et al., 2025], o1 and o1-mini [OpenAI, 2024b], QwQ [Team, 2024b], and o3-mini [OpenAI, 2025] series models. The chat models include closed-source models such as Doubao-1.5-pro, Qwen-max, Claude-3.5 [Anthropic, 2024], Gemini [Team, 2024a], GPT-4o [OpenAI, 2024a], Yi-Lightning [Wake et al., 2024], and open-source models like MiniMax-Text-01 [Li et al., 2025], Qwen2.5 [Yang et al., 2024a] series, Llama-3.1 [Dubey et al., 2024] series, Mistral [Jiang et al., 2023] and Mixtral [Jiang et al., 2024] series, Gemma-2 [Team et al., 2024]series, Yi-1.5 [Young et al., 2024] series, Phi4 [Abdin et al., 2024], and Granite-3.1 [Granite Team, 2024]. Additionally, there are fully open-source models like MAP-Neo [Zhang et al., 2024a] and OLMo-2 [OLMo et al., 2024]. According to our test results, these models still show significant gap when compared to industry standards level. The base models include Qwen2.5 [Yang et al., 2024a] series, DeepseekV3 [Liu et al., 2024], Yi-1.5 [Young et al., 2024] series, Llama-3.1 [Dubey et al., 2024] series, Gemma-2 [Team et al., 2024] series, and Mistral [Jiang et al., 2023] and Mixtral [Jiang et al., 2024] series. Reasoning models and chat models are evaluated using zero-shot approach, while base models are assessed using five-shot evaluation. Specifically, the five-shot evaluation for base models follow similar methodology to MMLU-Pro. The specific prompts employed for both the zero-shot and five-shot evaluations are detailed in Appendix F. For all main results, the temperature is set to 0. The maximum number of new tokens is set to 32K for reasoning models, while for all other models, it is set to 4K. More model results can be found in Appendix J, and all detailed results are provided in Appendix L. 4.2. Main Results We present the performances of the baselines on different levels, difficulties  (Table 5)  and disciplines  (Table 6)  . Overall Results. In general, the top-performed reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o1-2024-12-17) achieve the best overall performance in SuperGPQA. The effectiveness of instruction tuning to improve the performances is once again verified in the benchmark. 16 Model Overall (sample) Overall (subfield) Overall (field) Overall (discipline) Easy (sample) Middle (sample) Hard (sample) Reasoning Models DeepSeek-R1 o1-2024-12-17 DeepSeek-R1-Zero o3-mini-2025-01-31-high o3-mini-2025-01-31-medium o3-mini-2025-01-31-low o1-mini-2024-09-12 QwQ Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-250115 Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-241225 Qwen-max-2025-01-25 Claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 Gemini-2.0-flash DeepSeek-V3 MiniMax-Text-01 GPT-4o-2024-11-20 Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct GPT-4o-2024-08-06 Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411 Qwen-max-2024-09-19 Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct Phi-4 Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct Yi-Lightning Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct Gemma-2-27B-it Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct Granite-3.1-8B-instruct Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct MAP-Neo-7B-Instruct-v0.1 OLMo-2-1124-7B-Instruct Qwen2.5-72B Qwen2.5-32B DeepSeek-V3-Base Qwen2.5-14B Yi-1.5-34B Llama-3.1-70B Qwen2.5-7B Llama-3.1-405B Gemma-2-27B Mixtral-8x22B-v0.1 Qwen2.5-3B Mistral-7B-v0.3 Qwen2.5-1.5B OLMo-2-1124-13B MAP-Neo-7B Granite-3.1-8B-Base OLMo-2-1124-7B 61.82 60.24 60.24 55.22 52.69 48.03 45.22 43.59 55.09 50.93 50.08 48.16 47.73 47.40 45.11 44.40 43.14 41.64 40.75 40.65 39.96 38.76 37.69 37.65 35.15 34.86 33.42 29.23 28.78 27.43 23.31 20.83 18.82 18.66 17.05 16.81 34.33 33.16 32.14 30.19 27.62 27.22 25.36 25.23 24.49 22.41 20.14 19.48 17.17 16.07 15.76 15.69 15.15 62.61 61.25 61.62 54.94 52.66 48.51 45.46 44.40 56.55 52.41 52.75 51.38 48.70 49.10 47.46 47.62 46.43 44.79 43.66 43.38 42.93 41.18 40.56 39.59 37.72 38.94 36.57 32.14 30.78 30.50 25.45 22.85 20.91 20.46 18.52 18. 38.08 36.52 34.79 33.33 30.78 30.52 28.19 28.09 27.35 24.71 22.81 21.50 19.31 18.75 17.48 16.98 17.62 61.23 59.94 60.95 52.11 49.95 45.89 42.53 43.19 Chat Models 55.62 51.76 52.47 51.23 47.80 48.31 46.97 47.50 45.83 44.91 43.32 43.13 42.16 40.40 40.15 38.61 37.41 39.18 36.45 32.28 30.37 30.42 25.86 22.92 20.75 20.60 18.42 18.57 Base Models 38.70 37.33 34.58 34.14 31.03 31.28 28.73 28.33 27.96 25.04 23.30 21.81 19.80 19.82 18.26 16.79 18. 59.95 59.44 60.99 48.32 46.07 42.63 39.33 41.63 54.39 51.24 51.65 53.15 46.10 47.35 47.06 48.84 47.35 46.29 42.10 43.37 41.62 39.43 41.12 37.66 36.07 40.57 36.92 32.82 30.63 31.30 25.57 22.26 22.11 21.80 18.70 18.85 39.54 38.29 34.71 34.54 32.55 32.55 29.60 30.15 28.58 25.02 24.42 22.27 21.35 21.37 19.54 16.65 19.60 63.59 64.40 65.06 53.05 51.30 48.80 46.77 46.46 57.70 53.54 58.16 59.04 53.06 55.63 54.51 56.84 56.06 55.22 48.84 52.92 50.23 47.42 49.68 45.43 44.82 48.22 43.38 42.52 37.77 40.90 33.10 29.48 27.41 27.10 23.26 22.80 46.20 45.12 41.28 42.27 39.68 40.78 36.58 37.58 36.26 32.78 30.42 27.62 24.52 27.24 22.86 20.40 24. 63.63 61.44 62.61 56.09 53.79 50.21 47.34 47.40 60.15 56.56 54.95 51.91 49.56 50.11 48.60 48.75 46.31 45.11 45.42 43.28 43.63 43.05 40.68 40.91 37.90 37.85 35.32 29.73 30.98 27.45 23.50 19.79 18.19 17.85 16.62 15.82 38.12 36.58 34.50 31.44 27.95 26.95 25.94 25.12 24.07 21.67 19.81 18.65 16.79 14.41 14.64 15.65 13.83 56.87 53.67 50.99 56.16 52.37 43.53 40.00 34.07 43.80 38.70 33.09 29.99 38.84 33.86 28.98 23.50 23.70 20.98 24.10 22.81 22.60 22.13 19.55 23.69 19.97 15.22 19.35 13.82 15.23 12.64 12.24 13.09 10.45 10.74 10.95 11.90 15.01 14.34 18.20 14.85 13.86 12.78 12.10 11.86 12.27 12.26 9.40 11.96 9.74 6.57 9.83 10.60 7.

Performance on SuperGPQA. We present LLMs performance on different disciplines. The highest, the second-best and the third-best scores are shown in 𝑏𝑜𝑥 , bold and underlined, respectively. For instance, the results (47.40, 40.75) of DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct are significantly better than the results (32.14, 34.33) of DeepSeek-V3-Base and Qwen2.572B, respectively. More powerful LLMs achieve more balanced results on different difficulties. For example, the results of simple, middle and hard splits of DeepSeek-R1 are 63.59, 63.63 and 56.87. In contrast, the results of simple, middle and hard splits of Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct are 44.82, 37.90 and 19.97. Observations for Reasoning Models. Surprisingly, the performance gap between DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero is relatively small. In Table 6, the DeepSeek-R1 only beats DeepSeek-R1-Zero in two disciplines (i.e., Science and Engineering). In the other disciplines, the DeepSeek-R1-Zero is slightly better than DeepSeek-R1, which leaves the optimal training paradigm of the reason models an open question. From the performances across different dimensions, compared to the o1-2024-12-17 model, the newer o1-mini and o3-mini models show decreasing scores except in science and engineering, suggesting potential data leakage. Moreover, for different versions of o3mini (o3-mini-2025-01-31-high, o3-mini-2025-01-31-medium, o3-mini-2025-01-31-low), we observe obvious performance gaps for different difficulties. Advantages from Pre-training Corpus. The newer versions of proprietary LLMs achieve significant improvements on SuperGPQA, considering the incremental growing of qwen-max series (2024-09-192025-01-25: 39.96 50.08) and GPT-4o series (2024-0513 2024-08-06 2024-11-20: 39.76 41.64 44.40). Such incremental performances following the chronological order suggest that the developers of proprietary models highly value the incorporation of long-tailed knowledge. Moreover, we conjecture that the LLMs from Chinese firms (e.g., Qwen and Doubao) generally show superior performances is partially because their data collection pipelines are more aligned to SuperGPQA, i.e., considerable ratio of the references are translated from Chinese textbooks. Progress of Open-source. The SuperGPQA also reveals pessimistic open-source progress from the research community. In the dimension of pre-training corpus curation, the fully open-sourced LLMs (e.g., MAP-Neo-7B and OLMo-2-1124-13B) perform similarly and lag behind to other non fully open ones in similar sizes (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B). It can also be observed that, compared to the proprietary models, most of the open-weight LLMs except for the DeepSeek-R1 series are not satisfactory in our benchmark, especially 19 (a) Impact of subfield information. (b) Model robustness analysis. Figure 7. (a) Accuracy comparison of Qwen2.5 models (0.5B72B) with and without subfield information in prompts. Larger models benefit more from additional context. (b) Robustness evaluation across 24 semantically equivalent prompts, indicating larger models exhibit higher stability with lower variance. the hard questions. Difficulty-Specific Capabilities. The difficulty stratification in SuperGPQA reveals distinct capability patterns between reasoning-focused and knowledge-oriented LLMs. As shown in Table 5, the hard split specifically challenges models reasoning capacities, while easy and middle splits better reflect factual knowledge mastery. For instance, the o3-mini series exhibits lower scores than Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-250115 on easy and middle splits, yet surpasses it significantly on hard questions. This dichotomy suggests that: Chat-oriented LLMs (e.g., Doubao series) excel at knowledge recall for common professional questions but struggle with complex reasoning in long-tail domains. Reasoning-specialized models demonstrate superior performance on hard questions through enhanced logical processing, despite potential compromises in broad knowledge coverage. This differentiation validates SuperGPQAs design rationale using difficulty levels as diagnostic tools to dissect complementary capabilities in modern LLMs. 4.3. Further Analysis Effect of Subfield Information in Prompts. To investigate the impact of subfield information on model performance, we conduct zero-shot evaluations under two conditions: (1) zero-shot-with-subfield, where the prompt includes description of the problems 20 subfield, and (2) zero-shot-without-subfield, where no such information is provided. The prompts of zero-shot-with-subfield are shown in subsection G.1. We evaluate Qwen2.5Instruct models ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters across these two settings. Figure 7a show that incorporating subfield information generally leads to improved performance, particularly for larger models. For example, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct achieves an accuracy of 41.93% in the zero-shot-with-subfield setting, compared to 40.82% without subfield annotations. Similarly, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improves from 39.13% to 39.65%, and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct sees minor increase from 35.36% to 35.78%, suggesting that additional contextual information helps larger models refine their reasoning by narrowing down the relevant domain. However, for smaller models like Qwen2.5-0.5BInstruct and Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, the introduction of subfield information does not lead to noticeable gain in accuracy. Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct performs slightly worse with subfield annotations (10.62% vs. 11.12%), while Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct shows nearidentical performance (18.09% vs. 18.62%), indicating that smaller models may lack the capacity to leverage fine-grained domain-specific cues effectively, relying more on general knowledge retrieval rather than contextual domain disambiguation. Robustness Analysis. Benchmark evaluations can be significantly influenced by slight variations in prompts, leading to inconsistencies in model ranking and overall assessment reliability. To investigate this phenomenon, we conduct robustness experimentacross Qwen2.5-Instruct models (0.5B72B), employing 24 distinct yet semantically equivalent prompts in zero-shot setting, using the same evaluation parameters as in the main results. Specifically, we employ 4 types of initial prompts and 6 types of question formats, resulting in combination of 24 different prompt styles to verify the robustness of our bench. The combination of initial prompt 1 and question format 1 is the default prompt for our evaluation. The detailed prompts are shown in the subsection G.2. Figure 7b shows that larger models exhibit increased robustness, as steady improvement in accuracy from 9.80% of Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct to 41.15% of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct while variance decreases (𝜎 = 1.37 for the smallest model, dropping to 𝜎 0.27 0.36 in the largest models). This demonstrates the our evaluation framework is more stable with maximum standard deviation SD of 1.37%, that mitigates prompt-induced instability and provides more reliable basis for model assessment.

Performance comparison of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-20250115 under two ensembling strategies: (a) Best of (BoN) and (b) Majority Voting. BoN shows that Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct benefits more from increased sampling, whereas Majority Voting favors Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-20250115 due to its more consistent output distribution. Best of (BoN) Analysis. BoN (Best of N) is strategy that selects the highestquality response from independent generations which utilize stochastic sampling to improve overall performance. In our experiments, we evaluate Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-20250115 under BoN settings ranging from 𝑁 = 1 to 𝑁 = 32, with results presented in Figure 8a. Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct exhibits steeper BoN curve compared to Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-20250115, suggesting that Qwen benefits more significantly from multiple sampling attempts, likely due to higher variance in response quality. Conversely, Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-20250115 shows stronger initial performance but more gradual BoN gain, implying that its response distribution is more consistent but less opportunistic in leveraging multiple trials. Notably, while Doubao maintains lead in early BoN values (𝑁 15), Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct surpasses it around Bo24 and continues to outperform at Bo32, indicating that for scenarios where extensive sampling is feasible, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct demonstrates greater ability to exploit high-quality outputs. Majority Voting Analysis. 2 Majority Voting is strategy that selects the most frequently generated response from multiple independent runs. We evaluate Majority Voting using Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and Doubao-1.5-pro-32k-20250115 shown in Figure 8b. When multiple options receive the same highest number of votes, the answer is 2Both the BoN and Majority Voting analyses are conducted using the same set of inference results, generated with temperature = 0.7 and repeated for 32 independent runs. 22 considered correct if the correct option is among them. We show that Doubao-1.5-pro32k-20250115 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct across all voting sizes, exhibiting stable performance around 55-57%. In contrast, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct demonstrates fluctuations, particularly for lower N, with performance largely remaining in the 40-45% range, indicating that Doubao generates more consistent responses across independent runs. 4.4. Analysis of Disciplinary Discrimination Power To systematically evaluate the discrimination power across disciplines, we employ two complementary analytical approaches: descriptive statistics and discrimination indices analysis. The descriptive statistics approach examines the distribution characteristics of model performance within each discipline through three key metrics: Mean Accuracy: Reflects the overall difficulty level of the discipline. Standard Deviation (SD): Measures the dispersion of model performance. Coefficient of Variation (CV): Normalizes the standard deviation by mean accuracy, enabling cross-discipline comparison. The discrimination indices analysis complements this by comparing performance extremes through: High-Low Group Difference (Δ): Calculates the mean accuracy gap between the top 3 and bottom 3 models in each discipline. Table 7 presents complete results with group comparisons across all 13 disciplines, highlighting key patterns through color coding. Our systematic analysis reveals two distinct patterns in disciplinary discrimination power: High-discrimination disciplines: History (SD=8.45, CV=0.175, Δ=19.19) and Law (SD=7.17, CV=0.126, Δ=16.62) demonstrate the strongest differentiation capacity, indicating models exhibit substantially varied performance in these domains. Low-discrimination disciplines: Military Science (SD=4.99, CV=0.093, Δ=11.55), Engineering (SD=5.75, CV=0.107, Δ=13.13), and Management (SD=5.21, CV=0.099, Δ=10.98) exhibit performance convergence among top models. 23 Discipline Descriptive Statistics Discrimination Indices Analysis Mean Acc.

Comprehensive Discrimination Analysis with Several Key Evaluation Metrics (Mean Acc.: Mean Accuracy, SD: Standard Deviation, CV: Coefficient of Variation, Δ: High-Low Group Difference). The observed dichotomy between humanities and STEM disciplines emerges from fundamental differences in knowledge representation. The heightened discrimination in humanities (History CV=0.175) likely originates from: Context-dependent reasoning requiring real-world knowledge synthesis. Cultural nuance interpretation demands. Ethical judgment variance in open-ended scenarios. Conversely, the performance convergence in STEM fields (Engineering CV=0.107) reflects: Standardized problem-solving patterns in technical domains. Mathematical consistency in training corpora. Concentrated optimization efforts by model developers. This finding validates our experimental design hypothesis: when evaluating topperforming models (per-discipline top 10 selection), humanities disciplines better reveal capability differences due to their complexity beyond pattern recognition, while STEM 24 metrics approach performance ceilings. Our results emphasize the critical need for comprehensive cross-domain evaluation frameworks to fully capture models heterogeneous capabilities beyond technical domains. 5. Related Work 5.1. Large Language Models The landscape of natural language processing has been transformed by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) [Zhang et al., 2024a, Young et al., 2024]. The introduction of GPT-3 marked significant milestone, showcasing its ability to interpret tasks and examples from textual inputs with minimal prior training. Recently, the latest generation of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 [OpenAI, 2023], Claude-3.5 3, Gemini [Team, 2023], and Llama-3 [AI@Meta, 2024]), have exhibited remarkable progress in sophisticated reasoning across diverse fields. To comprehensively evaluate and challenge the expanding capabilities of these advanced AI systems, we present SuperGPQA. This novel benchmark is specifically crafted to probe the knowledge boundaries of existing LLMs. 5.2. LLM Benchmarks Recently, the development of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been transformed by the introduction of various benchmarks [Cobbe et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2024a, Bai et al., 2024]. Notable examples include GLUE [Wang et al., 2019b] and its successor SuperGLUE [Wang et al., 2019a], which have been instrumental in propelling advancements in language comprehension tasks. These foundational benchmarks paved the way for more specialized assessments, such as MMLU [Hendrycks et al., 2020], HotpotQA [Yang et al., 2018], BigBench [Srivastava et al., 2022], HellaSwag [Zellers et al., 2019], CommonsenseQA [Talmor et al., 2019], KOR-Bench [Ma et al., 2024], SimpleQA [Wei et al., 2024a] and Chinese SimpleQA [He et al., 2024a]. These newer benchmarks have expanded the evaluation scope to encompass content generation, knowledge understanding, and complex reasoning abilities. While numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate LLMs capabilities and alignment with human values, these have often focused narrowly on performance within singular tasks or domains. To enable more comprehensive LLM assessment, we propose SuperGPQA to scale the LLM evaluation to 285 graduate-level disciplines and provide comprehensive and fine-grained analysis of foundation models. 3https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet 25 6.

Annotation Tutorial B.1. Material Requirements The specific requirements for material selection are as follows: Ensure the selected materials are accurate, with correct answers. Ensure the materials cover variety of knowledge points and are free from regional bias. The selected materials should be correctly stated and involve certain level of academic reasoning, with difficulty appropriate for graduate-level study. Avoid using materials that rely on images as conditions. Verify that the materials comply with copyright requirements. 41 B.2. Annotation Methods During the annotation process, the following four methods are primarily used: 1) Original Transcription Method, 2) Non-Choice Conversion Method, and 3) Statement Combination Method. B.2.1. Original Transcription Method Original Transcription Description: Directly transcribe the original multiple-choice questions, ensuring the question maintains its original meaning and correctness. Additional distractors are included to increase the difficulty of the question or enhance its discriminative power. Operations: 1. Material Review: Ensure that the materials meet the aforementioned requirements, including accuracy, diversity, neutrality (free from regional bias), non-image-based content, and compliance with copyright regulations. 2. Question Transcription: Use OCR tools to recognize the text in the materials or directly paste the original content. Transcribe the question content word-for-word, ensuring no key information is omitted, with particular attention to the accurate transcription of formulas. 3. Option Transcription: Use OCR tools to recognize the text in the materials or directly paste the original content. Transcribe the options word-for-word, ensuring no key information is omitted, with particular attention to the accurate transcription of formulas. 4. Answer Identification: Clearly mark the correct answer within the list of options, ensuring its accuracy and uniqueness. 5. Distractor Addition: Add distractors while maintaining the quality of the options (avoiding meaningless or excess correct answers) until the annotator deems the level of confusion sufficient. The number of options should be between 4 and 10, with more options being preferred to increase the difficulty and discriminatory power of the question. 6. Field Completion: Complete the category fields (\"discipline\",\"field\",\"subfield\") and select the appropriate difficulty level to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the question information. B.2.2. Non-Choice Conversion Method Non-Choice Conversion Description: Convert non-multiple-choice questions (such as calculation questions, fill-in-theblank questions, etc.) into multiple-choice format, ensuring that the conditions of the question are complete and the final result is accurate while generating reasonable distractors based on the analysis steps or calculation process. Operations: 1. Material Review: Ensure that the materials meet the aforementioned requirements, including accuracy, diversity, neutrality (free from regional bias), non-image-based content, and compliance with copyright regulations. Ensure that the conditions of the question are complete and do not cause ambiguity. Add supplementary explanations if necessary. Ensure that the answer does not contain any essential explanatory process that is unsuitable for adaptation or transcription. 2. Question Transcription: Use OCR tools to recognize the text in the material or directly paste the original text. Transcribe the content of the original question word by word, ensuring that all numbers, formulas, or condition information in the question are accurate and complete to avoid ambiguity or incorrect answers. Add supplementary information if the question requires prior conditions from other questions. 3. Answer Transcription: Identify and select the correct result for the appropriate question based on the answer analysis process. item Use OCR tools to recognize results in the material and confirm that all numerical and formula information in the answer is accurate. 4. Distractor Addition: On the basis of the correct answer, consider setting common calculation errors (such as rounding errors, sign mistakes, digit errors, etc.) as distractors. For numerical results, the setting of distractors should consider reasonable ranges of calculation errors to ensure differentiation between options. 5. Answer Identification: Clearly mark the correct answer within the list of options, ensuring its accuracy and uniqueness. 6. Field Completion: Complete the category fields (\"discipline\",\"field\",\"subfield\") and select the appropriate difficulty level to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the question information. B.2.3. Statement Combination Method Statement Combination Description: By integrating stated expressions related to multiple concepts or knowledge points, multi-level, multi-perspective multiple-choice question is constructed to increase the comprehensiveness and depth of examination of the topic. Operations: 1. Statement Extraction: Extract core concepts, definitions, relationships between concepts, application cases, and common misconceptions from textbooks and related learning resources, ensuring that the statements are representative and comprehensive. Extract important statements from multiple-choice questions, covering multiple knowledge points to avoid being limited to single definition or formula, thus enhancing the overall comprehensiveness of the questions. Ensure that the extracted statements are accurate and concise, avoiding redundancy or vague expressions. The content should cover both correct and incorrect situations to provide foundation for subsequent adaptation. 2. Statement Adaptation: Adapt the extracted statements to include both correct and incorrect versions. Incorrect statements should be somewhat misleading, avoiding obvious or easily dismissible errors. 44 Number the adapted statements (e.g., I, II, III, etc.). Arrange the statements in reasonable order, avoiding bias towards any direction (e.g., always placing correct statements first). 3. Question Design: Depending on the need, questions may limit the scope or conditions being tested. \"Which of the following statements about [knowledge point] is correct?\" \"Which of the following statements about [knowledge point] is incorrect?\" 4. Combination Design: Combine the numbered statements to create options, such as and II; II and III; III, VI, and VII. Ensure that there is exactly one correct answer among the options. 5. Answer Identification: Clearly mark the correct answer within the list of options, ensuring its accuracy and uniqueness. 6. Field Completion: Complete the category fields (\"discipline\",\"field\",\"subfield\") and select the appropriate difficulty level to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the question information. B.2.4. Confusion-options Generation During the annotation process, we use large models to assist in generating distractors. We select Claude-3.5, GPT-4, Doubao, and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, and follow the prompt below to generate confusion options. In the annotation process, model is randomly selected to generate confusion option, which is then double-checked by the annotator. Finally, the confirmed confusion option is used as the final option. Prompt You are an expert in creating multiple-choice questions. Your task is to generate plausible but incorrect distractors for given question that only has one correct answer. You are skilled at introducing subtle yet distinct mathematical errors to the existing answer options, making the distractor look reasonable but still wrong. Input Description: You will be given: 45 question stem. set of answer options (no numbering). The correct answer (no numbering). Guidelines: 1. Generate Distractor: The distractor must be incorrect (not the correct answer). The distractor should introduce subtle mathematical error while maintaining the formula structure. It must be distinct from all existing options, including the correct answer. Avoid any repetition or overlap with the existing answer options in terms of value or meaning. Plausibility: The distractor should look reasonable and appear to be potential answer, but still be wrong. Ensure the question still has exactly one correct answer after adding the distractor. 2. Uniqueness Check: Thoroughly check all existing options (including the correct one) to ensure the distractor is unique. If the distractor matches any existing option, regenerate it. The distractor must not create ambiguity; the correct answer must remain the sole valid choice. 3. Formatting: Ensure the distractor matches the format of the existing options (e.g., fractions, exponents, etc.). Avoid formatting inconsistencies such as misplaced symbols or spaces. Output Format: <distractor> your generated distractor here </distractor> Do not include explanations or extra information. Do not include numbering. Input: Question: \"{}\", Options: {}, Correct Answer: \"{}\" Output: 46 C. Data Filtering and Manual Review Process Details In the data processing workflow, we employ three-stage filtering and review mechanism to ensure data quality: 1. Rule-Based Pre-Check subsection C.1: Data undergoes initial screening based on predefined code rules, quickly identifying and eliminating clearly invalid data points, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing subsequent workload. 2. LLM-Based Quality Inspection subsection C.2: Large language models are utilized to perform in-depth quality assessments of the data, identifying potential errors and inconsistencies, thereby improving the accuracy and completeness of the data. 3. Manual Quality Review subsection C.3: Experienced data analysts conduct final review to ensure the high quality and usability of the data, correcting potential misjudgments and incorporating domain knowledge for comprehensive evaluation. C.1. Rule-Based Pre-Check Table 8 presents the rules for data filtering and pre-checking, including text normalization, validation of the consistency of questions and options, integrity checks of answers, and requirements for the completeness of metadata such as difficulty, discipline, and others. 47 Category Rules Replace full-width punctuation with half-width punctuation. Remove unnecessary whitespace characters (e.g., spaces, newline characters, tab spaces). Text Replace common escape characters. Add missing escape characters. Not Empty or Placeholder. Ensure the question field is in string format to avoid errors. Text length > 5. Text Standardization. Question Perplexity 100, calculated using the Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model. No Semantic Duplicates: For given question 𝑞𝑖, the cosine similarity with each existing question 𝑞 𝑗 : CosineSimilarity(𝑞𝑖, 𝑞 𝑗) = < 0.90 ei ej ei ej where ei and ej are embeddings generated by the model SentenceTransformer(\"all-MiniLM-L6v2\"), and Faiss is used for efficient similarity search. 4 Option count 10. No empty or meaningless options (e.g., no empty strings, no only whitespace characters, no common placeholders like none, null). Options No duplicate options. Remove built-in option prefixes, using regular expressions(rˆ([A-Ja-j])[.s] , rˆ(([A-Ja-j])) , rˆ([A-Ja-j])) ). Text Standardization for each option. Not Empty or Placeholder. Answer Within options list. Text Standardization. Difficulty Ensure difficulty exists. Discipline Ensure discipline, field, and subfield exist. Table 8. Detailed Criteria for Rule-Based Pre-Check. C.2. LLM-Based Quality Inspection This section outlines the quality inspection process of LLMs in data processing, including: 1) Validity Check, 2) Negative and Extreme Inquiry Detection, 3) Multimodal Exclusion, 4) Field Relevance Evaluation, 5) Solvability Assessment. 48 C.2.1. Validity Check Purpose Validate the questions correctness, ensuring it follows the standards, can be answered with the given text, and the options are complete and reasonable. Prompt You are master of format checking, skilled at verifying whether multiple-choice questions in JSON format conform to the specifications. You will receive an input in JSON format containing question, options, and the answer, for example: { question: \"Question content\", options: [Option content, Option content, Option content, Option content], answer: \"Answer content\" } Please determine whether the text in the JSON represents complete and solvable multiple-choice question. It must meet the following requirements: 1. The question must explicitly pose specific problem or ask clear question that can be answered or calculated. If the question does not clearly ask something (e.g., if it is vague, incomplete, or does not directly ask for specific answer), it should be considered invalid. valid question should directly require an answer, such as asking for numerical value or selection (e.g., \"What is the value of X?\", \"Which of the following is correct?\", etc.). Questions that lack clear problem or dont ask for specific answer must be marked invalid. 2. The question, options, and answer must be fully defined. If any part is missing or unclear (e.g., if the answer does not match any of the listed options), the question should be deemed invalid. Note that the number of options is not factor in determining completenesshaving only one option is acceptable as long as the content is complete and coherent. 3. The question, options, and answer must be directly relevant to each other. The options should not reference each other, and there should be no circular dependencies or inter-referencing between options (e.g., Option is true because Option is false). Each option must stand independently, with no cross-references to other options. 49 4. Negative phrasing such as The following options are incorrect or None of the above is not allowed in the question. The question should use positive phrasing (e.g., Which of the following is correct?) to avoid confusion. If negative phrasing is detected in the question, it should be deemed invalid. 5. The question must be in valid multiple-choice format. If the question is not suitable for multiple-choice format (e.g., it is free-form answer question like problem or essay), it should be deemed invalid. Ensure that the question is designed specifically for multiple-choice answering, rather than being question that requires an open-ended response. Please return the result in the following JSON format: { \"is_valid\": true/false } Ensure that the output is valid JSON format and do not return any unrelated information. Input: { question: \"{}\", options: {}, answer: \"{}\" } Output: C.2.2. Negative and Extreme Inquiry Detection Purpose Identify negative questions that may appear in the options, such as Which of the following options is incorrect? or Which of the following is not correct?. Also, identify questions that use \"most\" to indicate higher degree of likelihood or preference, such as Which of the following is most likely to occur? or Which option is most appropriate?. These types of questions are prone to having distractors that meet the conditions. 50 Prompt 1 Please evaluate whether the following text is valid and well-formed multiple-choice question, adhering to the following criteria: 1. The question must not be negation (e.g., \"Which of the following is NOT...?\" or \"What is not...?\"). 2. The question should avoid vague or ambiguous phrasing, such as \"Which of the following is the best/worst...?\" or other uncertain expressions. 3. The answer choices should not be all affirmations or all negations, such as \"All of the above\" or \"None of the above,\" as these are considered inappropriate. Please return the result in the following JSON format: { \"is_valid\": true/false } Ensure that the output is valid JSON and do not return any unrelated information. Example input 1: { question: Which of the following procedure is not done in CHC?, options: [\"Aboion\", \"Blood transfusion\", \"Caesaran section\", \"Urine microscopy and culture sensitivity\"], answer: Urine microscopy and culture sensitivity } Example output 1: { \"is_valid\": false } Example input 2: { question: Most common viral cause of acquired aqueductal stenosis is?, options: [\"Rubella\", \"Mumps\", \"Toxoplasma\", \"Enterovirus\"], answer: Mumps } Example output 2: 51 { \"is_valid\": false } Example input 3: { question: Acute cerebral edema occurs at high altitude due to, options: [\"apillary blood pressure\", \"Cerebral arteriolar dilation\", \"Hypoxic damage to capillary walls leading to capillary leak\", \"All of the above\"], answer: All of the above } Example output 3: { \"is_valid\": false } Example input 4: { question: Rideal Walker test is used to determine the efficiency of the, options: [\"Disinfectant\", \"Moist heat sterilisation\", \"Antibiotics\", \"Dry heat sterilization\"], answer: Disinfectant } Example output 4: { \"is_valid\": true } Input: { \"question\": {}, \"options\": {}, \"answer\": {} } Output: Prompt 2 Input Description: You will be given: question statement (Question). Guidelines: 1. Analyze the final part of the question (the actual question being asked) to check for specific phrases: \"incorrect\" incorrect\" in context like \"which of the following is \"most\" in context like \"which is most likely\" 2. If either of these phrases appears in the questions final asking part, output true, followed by brief explanation of why the phrase is present. 3. If neither phrase is found in the questions final part, output false, followed by brief explanation. Output Format: Provide response with: true or false as the first part of the output brief explanation that justifies your answer Example Input: Question: \"A new technology is introduced in manufacturing plant. Which of the following is most likely to occur?\" Example Output: { } \"is_valid\": true/false, Explanation: Brief explanation of why the phrase is present. 53 Question: {} Output: { } \"is_valid\": true/false, C.2.3. Multimodal Exclusion Purpose Check if the question relies on multimodal image information, and remove questions involving image information."

If the \"field\" is suitable, evaluate whether the \"subfield\" is relevant. 54 If the \"subfield\" is highly relevant to the question, the entire classification (\"discipline,\" \"field,\" and \"subfield\") is considered appropriate, even if there are minor mismatches in the \"discipline\" or \"field.\" If no levels meet the above criteria, or if any level other than \"subfield\" is deemed inappropriate and the \"subfield\" is not highly relevant, the classification is considered not relevant. Prompt You are an expert in hierarchical classification. Based on the given question and the provided three-level classification structure (discipline, field, subfield), evaluate whether the classification assigned to the question is appropriate. Classification Structure: { } \"discipline\": \"{}\", \"field\": \"{}\", \"subfield\": \"{}\" Question: {} Instructions: 1. Evaluate the classification level by level: First, check if the discipline is relevant to the question. If discipline is appropriate, evaluate if the field is relevant. If field is appropriate, evaluate if the subfield is relevant. 2. Special rule: If the subfield is found to be highly relevant to the question, the entire classification (discipline, field, and subfield) is considered appropriate, regardless of minor mismatches in discipline or field. 3. If no levels meet the above criteria, or if any level other than subfield is deemed inappropriate without subfield being highly relevant, the classification is considered not relevant. 4.

Question: refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is ( ). A) 10 B) 40 C) 6 D) 25 E) 15 F) 50 G) 30 H) 4 I) J) 20 Answer: Lets think step by step. In refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. Answer: H. Question: Say the pupil of your eye has diameter of 5 mm and you have telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye? A) 1000 times more B) 50 times more C) 5000 times more D) 500 times more E) 10000 times more F) 20000 times more G) 2000 times more H) 100 times more I) 10 times more J) N/A Answer: Lets think step by step. The amount of light telescope can gather compared to the human eye is proportional to the area of its apertures. The area of circle is given by the formula 𝐴 = 𝜋 (cid:0) 𝐷 , where 𝐷 is the diameter. Therefore, the relative light-gathering 2 power is calculated as: (cid:1) 2 (cid:17) 2 (cid:17) (cid:16) 50 cm 2 (cid:16) 5 mm 2 = (cid:17) 2 (cid:17) 2 (cid:16) 50 cm 0.1 cm (cid:16) 5 mm 0.1 cm = 5002 52 = 10000. Answer: E. Question: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know? A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system like the Kuiper belt. B) The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating 70 spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt. C) The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. D) The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud. E) The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud. F) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud. G) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. Answer: Lets think step by step. Most short-period comets originate from the Kuiper belt. This is deduced from the observation that these comets tend to follow orbits that lie in the plane of the solar system, similar to the distribution of objects in the Kuiper belt itself. Thus, the alignment of these cometary orbits with the ecliptic plane points to their Kuiper belt origin. Answer: A. Question: Colors in soap bubble result from light ( ). A) dispersion B) deflection C) refraction D) reflection E) interference F) converted to different frequency G) polarization H) absorption I) diffraction J) transmission Answer: Lets think step by step.The colorful patterns observed in soap bubble are caused by the phenomenon of light interference. This occurs when light waves bounce between the two surfaces of the soap film, combining constructively or destructively based on their phase differences and the varying thickness of the film. These interactions result in vibrant color patterns due to variations in the intensity of different wavelengths of light. Answer: E. Question: microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven? 71 A) 240 B) 120 C) 10 D) 480 E) 360 F) 200 G) 30 H) 150 I) 60 J) 300 Answer: Lets think step by step. The rate of energy usage, known as power, in an electrical circuit is calculated by the product of voltage and current. For microwave oven connected to 120 outlet and drawing current of 2 amps, the power consumption can be calculated as follows: Power = Voltage Current = 120 2 = 240 W. Therefore, the microwave oven uses energy at rate of 240 watts. Answer: A. {Question} Answer: Lets think step by step. G. Further Experiment Analysis G.1.
