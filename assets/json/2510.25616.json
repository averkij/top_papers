When ex-\nposed to novel visual or linguistic contexts, such models exhibit\nrobust cross-modal understanding and compositional perception\n– properties that underpin their strong zero and few-shot gener-\nalization beyond the training distribution. These advancements\nhave naturally inspired the extension of VLMs toward embodied\ndomains.",
            "content": "VisionLanguageAction (VLA) models represent prominent direction in this research trajectory. They adapt pretrained VLMs to action prediction tasks in robotic settings, with the goal of leveraging the semantic priors and cognition abilities inherited from large-scale visionlanguage pretraining. The underlying hypothesis is that, if appropriately adapted, VLA models can transfer the visualsemantic representations of their initial VLM to the action domain, enabling generalization to previously unseen scenes, instructions, and scenarios. However, in practice, adapting VLMs to the action modality often introduces new challenges. Several recent Under review Figure 1: Visual alignment method overview. Mid-level VLA features are projected onto normalized sphere and aligned with teacher embeddings, preserving visual semantics and improving OOD generalization. Bottom plots show comparison with standard SFT across three generalization axes on the Simpler-based benchmark [33]. studies [11, 15, 32, 36, 40] have shown that current VLA models struggle to maintain generalization in visually and linguistically complex tasks, raising questions about whether strong VL capabilities of VLMs truly transfer to embodied settings. This issue becomes the most evident during task-specific fine-tuning, where limited data diversity and datasets frequently lead to overfitting [13, 14, 40, 42, 54]. During large-scale robotic pretraining, recent works have attempted to mitigate this degradation by preserving multimodal understanding capabilities. Prior strategies include incorporating auxiliary reasoning objectives [10], applying multimodal co-training on web-scale data [52], or freezing pretrained visuallanguage backbones to preserve VL representations and improve instruction following [15, 38]. While these approaches help retain visionlanguage knowledge and improve generalization, they often depend on heavy supervision, high computational cost, or constrained model architecture. Yet, despite these advances at the pretraining stage, there remain no effective methods to address representation degradation during task-specific supervised finetuning (SFT) the critical phase where VLA models must adapt to certain robotic domains without losing their semantic grounding and VL abilities. Figure 2: Overview of the proposed method. (a, b) Training pipeline with visual alignment loss no extra overhead, only precomputed teacher features and lightweight regularization term during SFT. (c) Conceptual illustration of the loss landscape for VL tasks: the core idea is to optimize the model with respect to the action objective while preserving performance on VL understanding. In this work, we adopt realistic VLA deployment setting: starting from pretrained VLA and adapting it with limited data for supervised fine-tuning in chosen embodiment and domain. Under these constraints, we conduct systematic investigation into the degradation of VL representations and multimodal understanding abilities in VLA models and ask central question: Can we design simple yet effective method to recover the inherited VL representations during fine-tuning on robotic actions? To answer this question, we first examined the attention maps and feature activations of the VLA model in comparison to VLMs across matched image-instruction pairs from the robotics domain. Our analysis of attention maps revealed that: while the pretrained VLM accurately focuses on task-relevant objects, the fine-tuned VLA models often produce diffuse or misplaced activations, failing to attend to key entities under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions (Figure 4). Next, we conducted t-SNE [46] analysis of intermediate representations across VLMs and VLAs layers, which exposed clear representation collapse [1, 4] in VLA models indicating that standard action fine-tuning compresses diverse internal features into narrow representation space, reducing representational diversity and generalization capacity. Next, we propose VL-Think task suite (section 4) to assess transfer of VL knowledge from VLMs to VLA models, benchmark several strong VLMs and compare OpenVLA7B [26] to its pretrained base (PrismaticVLM [25]). We observe systematic, domain-specific forgetting after action fine-tuning, indicating that VLAs lose VL knowledge about domains absent from the robotics fine-tuning data. To address this representational degradation, we introduce lightweight Visual Representation Alignment method inspired by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis [22]. This hypothesis suggests that large vision and language models tend to converge toward shared latent representation space that encodes general visual and semantic representations across generalist models. Our method explicitly constrains the visual representations of VLA to remain aligned with generalist vision model throughout fine-tuning. By maintaining this link, the VLA preserves semantic consistency while adapting its action policy to new tasks. The method adds negligible computational overhead and integrates seamlessly with SFT (Figure 2). Extensive experiments on different variations of Simpler [28] benchmark demonstrates that this alignment consistently improves out-of-distribution generalization yielding up to 10% relative gain over naive SFT  (Table 1)  . Our key contributions are as follows: (1) We systematically demonstrate that naive VLA fine-tuning induces representation collapse and attention sink relative to their initial VLM. (2) We introduce VL-Think, diagnostic task suite for assessing transfer of VL knowledge from VLMs across VLA models and show that VLA action fine-tuning lead to domainspecific forgetting. (3) We propose simple and efficient visual alignment method that anchors the VLAs vision representations to strong visual teacher features, preserving multimodal understanding and improving OOD generalization without added complexity (Figure 2). Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the tradeoff between action fine-tuning and representation degradation in VLA models. They underscore the importance of maintaining visuallanguage alignment during fine-tuning and provide practical recipe for building VLAs that do not blind the pretrained perceptual knowledge they rely upon."

Recent representation learning methods reinforce this trend: REPA [53] aligns diffusion hidden states to strong image encoders (faster training, better ImageNet quality), OLA-VLM [23] distills multi-teacher targets into intermediate LLM layers via predictive embedding losses, 3DRS [21] injects 3D-aware supervision with multi-view correspondence, and Geometry Forcing [51] aligns videodiffusion features with 3D backbone via angular/scale objectives for temporally consistent generations."

Finally, using the VL-Think suite, we assess the transferability of VLM VL skills to VLA policies. Together, these methods provide intuitive and interpretable diagnostics of VL representation degradation and domain forgetting revealing whether the model maintains focused visual grounding, coherent latent organization and erodes domain-specific knowledge after action fine-tuning.

We hypothesize that VLA models lose knowledge about domains that are absent in robotics fine-tuning datasets.

This setup directly quantifies how linearly decodable the visual features remain after action fine-tuning. The results summarized in Table 3 reveal several consistent trends. As expected, the C-RADIOv3 teacher achieves the highest probing accuracy, reflecting its strong pretrained representations. Among the VLA variants, the OpenVLA fine-tuned with our proposed Visual Representation Alignment method outperforms both the pretrained checkpoint and the model fine-tuned with naive SFT. This improvement indicates that our alignment strategy effectively enhances the VLAs representations during action fine-tuning. In contrast, naive SFT substantially reduces probing accuracy relative to the pretrained model, confirming that standard fine-tuning harms representational quality. Our aligned model not only mitigates this degradation but surpasses the pretrained baseline, indicating that the alignment loss strengthens semantic consistency and leads to more transferable visual features."

Our experiments show that the frozen MLP projector yields the most reliable, robust alignment across all evaluation dimensions. We hypothesize that freezing the projector is critical in our setup: when trainable, the model minimizes alignment loss primarily through projector adaptation rather than meaningful changes in the VLAs internal representations. In this case, the projector quickly learns to output embeddings that merely approximate the teachers space, effectively bypassing representational correction. We attribute this to two factors: the relatively small amount of alignment data and the substantial dimensionality gap between the vision teacher and the VLA backbone embeddings (𝑑𝑡 = 768, 𝑑𝑒 = 4096). Freezing the projector constrains this shortcut, forcing the alignment objective to act directly on the students hidden representations, yielding more semantically grounded and transferable feature alignment."

Prior literature on VLM interpretability [56] and our own analyses (Figure 5.1) suggest that middle layers are primarily responsible for VL fusion and semantic grounding, whereas early layers encode low-level features and later layers specialize in action prediction. Accordingly, we perform experiments aligning different types of layers: Early, Middle, Late.

Theia: Distilling [41] 10 APPENDIX This appendix provides additional technical details, extended results, and supplementary materials that support and complement the main findings presented in the paper. We include comprehensive ablations on alignment strategies, projector architectures, teacher models, and layer selection and alignment coefficient. These materials aim to enhance the transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability of our proposed method. A.1 Training Hyperparameters Table 9 presents the training parameters used during the visual alignment fine-tuning. All other training parameters remained unchanged across both experiments and model variants. Table 9: Best training configuration for OpenVLA fine-tuning with visual alignment. All other methods were trained with identical hyperparameters except for the alignment-specific settings."

These layers correspond to the region of strongest visionlanguage fusion, where attention patterns most directly reflect the models visual grounding quality. As shown in Figure 6, the default OpenVLA SFT exhibits diffuse and spatially inconsistent attention, often extending beyond the queried object. In contrast, our OpenVLA Align model restores sharp, localized focus on task-relevant regions. This confirms that the proposed visual alignment effectively mitigates attention sink introduced by naive fine-tuning and preserves coherent objectcentered attention. Figure 6: Attention maps across middle layers Qwen2.5-VL, OpenVLA SFT, and OpenVLA Align. The proposed alignment method restores sharp, object-centered attention patterns, improving visual grounding degraded by standard fine-tuning.

A.5 Ablations This section provides the complete ablation results that underlie the analyses in section 8, Vision teachers  (Table 11)  , Alignment projectors  (Table 10)  , Alignment layers  (Table 9)  , Alignment coefficients  (Table 13)  . In the ablation studies presented in section 8, we test the hypothesis that given model variant (denoted B) outperforms the baseline variant (A) in terms of success rate. For each pairwise comparison, we fix all other parameters altering only the component under investigation (e.g., alignment objective, layer depth, projection type). This ensures that any observed performance difference can be attributed solely to the ablated design choice. To assess statistical significance, we use the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test [50], non-parametric test suited for comparing two matched samples that do not necessarily follow normal distribution. The unit of analysis is the per-seed success rate over matched trials, evaluated independently for each environment type (Semantic, Vision, Execution). The test uses one-sided alternative hypothesis (𝐻1: > A), corresponding to our directional research question and report the exact p-value. All comparisons are conducted over 128 shared random seeds, ensuring that each seedenvironment pair is identical across the methods being compared. This careful experimental control allows us to draw meaningful conclusions about the contribution of each individual design choice."
