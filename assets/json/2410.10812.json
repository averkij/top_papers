            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) is pushing artificial intelligence into new era. At the core of LLMs are autoregressive (AR) models, which have gained popularity due to their generality and versatility. These models typically predict the next token in sequence based on the previous tokens as input. While originating from natural language processing, autoregressive models have also recently been adopted for visual generation tasks. These approaches utilize visual tokenizer to convert images from pixel space into discrete visual tokens through vector quantization (VQ) (Van Den Oord et al., 2017). These visual tokens are then processed in the same manner as language tokens. Benefiting from techniques proven successful in the LLM field, autoregressive visual generation methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in diverse tasks, including text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and image editing (Van Den Oord et al., 2017; Esser et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022b; Kondratyuk et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2024). Autoregressive image generation models have also demonstrated significant potential for building unified visual language models (Gemini Team, Google, 2023; OpenAI, 2024), such as Emu3 (Emu3 Team, BAAI, 2024), VILA-U (Wu et al., 2024), and Show-o (Xie et al., 2024). Concurrently, another major trend in visual generation from Ho et al. (2020); Rombach et al. (2022); Chen et al. (2024a); BlackForest Labs (2024) has centered on diffusion models. These models employ progressive denoising process, beginning with random Gaussian noise. Diffusion models achieve better generation quality compared with autoregressive models, but they can be computationally expensive to deploy: even with an efficient DPM-Solver sampler from Lu et al. (2022), it still takes DiT-XL/2 (Peebles & Xie, 2023) 20 denoising steps to generate an image, which translates to 86.2T MACs at 10241024 resolution. In contrast, generating comparable image using similarly sized AR model capable of predicting multiple tokens in parallel (Tian et al., 2024) requires only 10.1T MACs at the same resolution, which is 8.5 less computationally intensive. This paper addresses the following question: Can we develop an autoregressive model that matches the visual generation quality of diffusion models while still being significantly faster? Currently, visual generation AR models lag behind diffusion models in two key aspects: 1. Discrete tokenizers in AR models exhibit significantly poorer reconstruction capabilities compared to the continuous tokenizers used by diffusion models. Consequently, AR models have lower generation upper bound and struggle to accurately model fine image details. 2. Diffusion models excel in high-resolution image synthesis, but no existing AR model can directly and efficiently generate 10241024 images. To address these challenges, we introduce HART (Hybrid Autoregressive Transformer) for efficient high-resolution visual synthesis. HART bridges the reconstruction performance gap between discrete tokenizers in AR models and continuous tokenizers in diffusion models through hybrid tokenization. The hybrid tokenizer decomposes the continuous latent output of the autoencoder into two components: one as the sum of discrete latents derived from VAR tokenizer (Tian et al., 2024), and the other as the continuous residual, representing the information that cannot be captured by discrete tokens. The discrete tokens captures the big picture, while continuous residual tokens focus on fine details (Figure 3). These two latents are then modeled by our hybrid transformer: the discrete latents are handled by scalable-resolution VAR transformer, while the continuous latents are predicted by lightweight residual diffusion module with 5% parameter and 10% runtime overhead. HART achieves significant improvements in both image tokenization and generation over its discrete-only baseline. Compared with VAR, it reduces the reconstruction FID from 2.11 to 0.30 at 10241024 resolution on MJHQ-30K (Li et al., 2024a), enabling HART to lower the 1024px generation FID on the same dataset from 7.85 to 5.38 (a 31% relative improvement). Furthermore, we demonstrate that HART achieves up to 7.8% improvement in FID over VAR for class-conditioned generation on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). HART also outperforms MAR on this task with 13 higher throughput. Notably, HART closely matches the quality of state-of-the-art diffusion models in multiple text-toimage generation metrics. Simultaneously, HART achieves 3.1-5.9 faster inference latency, 4.57.7 higher throughput, and requires 6.9-13.4 less computation compared with diffusion models. 3 Preprint, work in progress Figure 3: HART synergizes discrete and continuous tokens. The discrete tokens capture the overall image structure, while the fine details (e.g. eyes, eyebrows and hair) are reflected in the residual tokens, which is modeled by residual diffusion (introduced in Section 3.2)."

            "content": "Visual generation has become key focus in machine learning research. Initial work by Kingma & Welling (2013) introduced variational autoencoders (VAEs) for image synthesis. Subsequently, Goodfellow et al. (2014) proposed generative adversarial networks (GANs), which were further improved by Brock et al. (2018); Karras et al. (2019); Kang et al. (2023). Diffusion models from Ho et al. (2020); Nichol & Dhariwal (2021); Dhariwal & Nichol (2021); Ramesh et al. (2022); Betker et al. (2023) have emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for generating high-quality images after VAE and GAN. The latent diffusion model from Rombach et al. (2022); Podell et al. (2023) applies U-Net to denoise the Gaussian latent input, and is succeeded by DiT from Peebles & Xie (2023) and U-ViT from Bao et al. (2023) which replaces the U-Net with transformers. Chen et al. (2023; 2024b;a) scale up DiTs to text-to-image (T2I) generation. Concurrently, Kolors Team (2024); Ma et al. (2024a); Li et al. (2024a) further scaled up T2I diffusion models to billions of parameters. Recent research from Esser et al. (2024); Auraflow Team (2024); BlackForest Labs (2024) also explored rectified flow for fast sampling. Autoregressive models pioneered by Chen et al. (2020) generate images as pixel sequences, rather than denoising an entire latent feature map simultaneously. Early research VQVAE and VQGAN from Van Den Oord et al. (2017); Esser et al. (2021) quantize image patches into discrete tokens and employ decoder-only transformer to predict these image tokens, analogous to language modeling. VQGAN was subsequently enhanced in several aspects: Yu et al. (2022a) improved its autoencoder modeling, Chang et al. (2022); Yu et al. (2023a); Li et al. (2023) increased its sampling speed with MaskGIT, while Mentzer et al. (2023), Yu et al. (2023b), and Yu et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024c) enhanced its tokenization efficiency. Lee et al. (2022) introduced residual quantization to reduce tokenization error. Building on this, Tian et al. (2024) developed VAR, which innovatively transformed next-token prediction in RQVAE to next-scale prediction, significantly improving sampling speed. There were also efforts that scaled up autoregressive models to text-conditioned visual generation: Ramesh et al. (2021); Ding et al. (2021; 2022); Liu et al. (2024b); Sun et al. (2024); Crowson et al. (2022); Gafni et al. (2022); Emu3 Team, BAAI (2024); Liu et al. (2024a) were T2I generation methods based on VQGAN. Among these work, concurrent work from Liu et al. (2024a) achieves high quality 1024px image generation through AR modeling. We will demonstrate that HART excels in efficiency compared with their approach. Chang et al. (2023); Villegas et al. (2022); Kondratyuk et al. (2023); Xie et al. (2024); Chen et al. (2024c); Bai et al. (2024) extended MaskGIT. STAR, VAR-CLIP (Ma et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024) were extensions of VAR. ControlVAR (Li et al., 2024d), ControlAR (Li et al., 2024e) and CAR Yao et al. (2024) also study controllable AR image generation. LANTERN (Jang et al., 2024) accelerates AR models through speculative decoding. Hybrid models represent new class of visual generative models that synergize discrete and continuous image modeling approaches. GIVT from Tschannen et al. (2023) predicted continuous visual tokens with autoregressive models while VQ-Diffusion from Gu et al. (2022) extended diffusion to discrete latents. MAR from Li et al. (2024b) and DisCo-Diff from Xu et al. (2024) conditioned diffusion model with autoregressive prior. This idea was also concurrently explored in visual language models by Ge et al. (2024); Jin et al. (2023). Transfusion (Zhou et al., 2024) fuses DiT and LLM into single model, and is natively capable of multi-modal generation. Concurrent work DART by Gu et al. (2024) also supports native multi-modal generation by flattening the denoising trajectory in diffusion models into multiple autoregressive sampling steps. 4 Preprint, work in progress"

            "content": "Figure 4: Reconstruction quality comparison between VAR and HART tokenizers. The discrete tokenizer employed by VAR will lose some details or have some distortion during the reconstruction, which is solved by hybrid tokenization in HART. Please zoom in for details in 1k images. Figure 5: Unlike conventional image tokenizers that decode either continuous or discrete latents, the hybrid tokenizer in HART is trained to decode both continuous and discrete tokens. At inference time, we only decode continuous tokens, which are the sum of discrete tokens and residual tokens. The residual tokens will be modeled by residual diffusion (introduced in Figure 6). Conventional autoregressive visual generation encodes images into discrete tokens using trained tokenizers. These tokens map to entries in vector-quantized (VQ) codebook and can reconstruct the original images from the VQ tokens. This approach transforms text-to-image generation into sequence-to-sequence problem, where decoder-only transformer, or LLM, predicts image tokens from text input. The tokenizers reconstruction quality sets the upper limit for image generation. Constrained by their finite vocabulary codebooks, discrete tokenizers often struggle to faithfully reconstruct images with intricate, high-frequency details such as human faces, as in Figure 4. Hybrid tokenization. We introduce our hybrid tokenizer in Figure 5. The primary goal of hybrid tokenization is to enable the decoding of continuous features during generation, thereby overcoming the poor generation upper bound imposed by finite VQ codebooks. We begin with CNN-based visual encoder that transforms the input image into continuous visual tokens in the latent space. These tokens are then quantized into discrete tokens across multiple scales, following VAR (Tian et al., 2024). The multi-scale vector quantization process results in difference between the accumulated discrete features and the original continuous visual features, which can not be accurately represented using VQ codebook elements. We term this difference residual tokens, which are subsequently modeled by residual diffusion, as detailed in Section 3.2. Alternating training. To train our hybrid tokenizer, we begin by initializing the visual encoder, quantizer (i.e., codebook), and visual decoder from pretrained discrete VAR tokenizer. We then freeze the visual encoder and quantizer, allowing only the visual decoder to be trained. During each training step, we randomly choose with equal probability (50%) whether to provide the decoder with discrete or continuous visual tokens for reconstructing the input image. Specifically, when the Preprint, work in progress continuous path is selected (lower red path in Figure 5), it bypasses the VQ quantizer, effectively turning the model into conventional continuous autoencoder. Otherwise, if the discrete path is selected (upper red path in Figure 5), we are essentially training standard VQ tokenizer. Empirical results show that the HART tokenizer achieves comparable continuous rFID (i.e., reconstruction FID when the continuous path is activated) to the SDXL tokenizer (Podell et al., 2023), while its discrete rFID matches the performance of the original VQ tokenizer. As result, the generation upper bound of HART remains consistent with state-of-the-art diffusion models. This alternating training strategy also ensures that the continuous and discrete latents remain sufficiently similar from the decoders perspective, facilitating easier modeling of continuous latents. Discussions. Its important to note that low rFID does not necessarily indicate better generation FID. The alternating approach in training our hybrid tokenizer is crucial for high-quality generation. In Section 4.3, we demonstrate that other methods, such as using separate decoders for continuous and discrete tokens, may achieve similar continuous reconstruction FID but significantly compromise generation FID. Furthermore, the next subsection explains why autoregressive methods utilizing continuous tokenizers, like MAR (Li et al., 2024b), are less efficient than HART."

            "title": "3.2 HYBRID AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELING WITH RESIDUAL DIFFUSION",
            "content": "Figure 6: HART is an efficient hybrid autoregressive image generation framework. It decomposes continuous image tokens into two components: 1) series of discrete tokens modeled by scalable-resolution (up to 1024px) autoregressive transformer, and 2) residual tokens modeled by lightweight residual diffusion (37M parameters and 8 steps) module. The final image representation is the sum of these two components. Hybrid tokenization offers superior rFID and better generation upper bound compared to discrete tokenization. We introduce HART (Figure 6) to efficiently translate this improved upper bound into real enhancements in generation quality. HART models the continuous image tokens as the sum of two components: (1) discrete tokens, modeled by scalable-resolution autoregressive transformer, and (2) residual tokens, fitted by an efficient residual diffusion process. Scalable-resolution autoregressive transformer. Our discrete token modeling extends VAR to text-to-image generation and improves scalability at higher resolutions. HART concatenates text tokens with visual tokens during training, in contrast to VAR which use single class token. The text tokens are visible to all visual tokens, as in Figure 6 (right). Our approach is 25% more parameterefficient than STAR (Ma et al., 2024b)s cross-attention method (Chen et al., 2023). HART directly generates 1024px images using single model, offering superior efficiency compared to existing AR-based solutions that rely on super-resolution (Yu et al., 2022b) or one-token-per-step prediction (Liu et al., 2024a). To mitigate the O(n4) training cost for high-resolution AR transformers, we finetune from pretrained low-resolution checkpoints. We convert all absolute position embeddings (PEs) in VAR to interpolation-compatible relative embeddings, including step (indicating the resolution each token belongs to) and token index embeddings. We utilize sinusoidal PE for step embeddings, which naturally accommodates varying sampling steps in 256/512px (10 steps) and 1024px (14 steps) generation. For token index embeddings, we implement hybrid approach: 1D rotary embeddings for text tokens and 2D rotary embeddings (Sun et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024) for visual tokens. The position indices of visual tokens directly continue from those of text tokens. We found these relative embeddings significantly accelerates HART convergence at higher resolutions. Residual diffusion. We employ diffusion to model residual tokens, given their continuous nature. Similar to MAR (Li et al., 2024b), we believe that full DiT is unnecessary for learning this residual. Instead, lightweight (37M parameters) residual diffusion MLP would be sufficient. This MLP is Preprint, work in progress conditioned on the last layer hidden states from our scalable-resolution AR transformer, as well as the discrete tokens predicted in the last VAR sampling step. Despite similar denoising MLP model architectures, HART differs fundamentally from MAR. While MAR predicts full continuous tokens, HART models residual tokensa crucial distinction for efficient diffusion modeling. Although both trained with 1000-step noise schedule, HART achieves optimal quality with just 8 sampling steps at inference, compared to MARs 30-50, resulting in 4-6 reduction in diffusion module overhead. This demonstrates that HARTs residual tokens are significantly easier to learn than MARs full tokens. Other differences. The AR transformers in HART and MAR differ significantly in their formulation. MARs AR transformer generates only conditions for its diffusion MLP, lacking discrete codebook for token generation. In contrast, HARTs AR transformer produces both discrete tokens and diffusion conditions. These discrete tokens can be decoded into meaningful, albeit less detailed, images using our hybrid tokenizer design (Figure 3). This approach reduces the burden on residual diffusion, which only needs to model fine details rather than the overall image structure. Furthermore, HART supports KV caching for faster inference, significantly reducing computational costs. MARs transformer, based on MaskGIT (Chang et al., 2022), lacks this capability. In contrast to other representative AR+diffusion methods such as LaVIT (Jin et al., 2023) and SEEDX (Ge et al., 2024), which employ complete diffusion models (1B parameters, 20 steps) for full continuous tokens, HART provides significant efficiency gains through the use of tiny diffusion MLP (37M parameters, 8 steps) that models only residual tokens. 3.3 EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENTS While our scalable-resolution AR transformer and residual diffusion designs are crucial for highquality, high-resolution image generation, they inevitably introduce inference and training overhead. We address these efficiency challenges in this section. Training. The residual diffusion module introduces both computational and memory overhead during training. To mitigate this, we discovered that discarding 80% of the tokens (on average) in the final step and applying supervision only to the subsampled tokens during training does not result in performance degradation. This approach accelerates training by 1.4 at 512px and 1.9 at 1024px, while also reducing training memory usage by 1.1. In the appendix, we explain the effectiveness of this method by demonstrating that the attention pattern in our autoregressive transformer is mostly local. Consequently, although token subsampling during training may compromise global interactions between tokens, it has small impact on attention calculation. Inference. For inference, we observed that relative position embeddings introduced multiple memory-bound GPU kernel calls, in contrast to the single call required for absolute position embeddings in VAR (Tian et al., 2024). To optimize performance, we fused these computations into two kernels: one for sinusoidal calculation and another for rotary embedding. This optimization resulted in 7% improvement in end-to-end execution time. Additionally, fusing all operations in RMSNorm into single GPU kernel also improved total runtime by 10%."

We evaluate HART on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) for classconditioned image generation, and on MJHQ-30K (Li et al., 2024a), GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2024), and DPG-Bench (Hu et al., 2024) for text-to-image generation. The HART tokenizer is trained on OpenImages (Kuznetsova et al., 2020). For HART transformer training, we utilize ImageNet, JourneyDB (Pan et al., 2023), and internal MidJourney-style synthetic data. All text-to-image generation data are recaptioned using VILA1.5-13B (Lin et al., 2024). We measure all quality and efficiency metrics using open-source models with recommended sampling parameters as released by their authors.

We evaluate the HART hybrid tokenizer on ImageNet and MJHQ-30K, two datasets not observed during training. As shown in Table 1, our hybrid tokenization offers significant advantages over discrete tokenization, reducing the 1024px rFID from 2.11 to 0.30. This matches the performance level of the SDXL tokenizer, indicating that the generation upper bound of HART is comparable to that of diffusion models. The discrete rFID of our hybrid tokenizer also ensures that the discrete tokens still capture the majority of image structure, so that the residual tokens remain easily learnable.

It also offers 7.8% FID reduction with 4% runtime overhead compared with VAR (Tian et al., 2024). Time: bs=64 on A100. cated by the CLIP score on the same dataset. On GenEval and DPG-Bench, HART achieves results comparable to diffusion models with <2B parameters. Importantly, HART achieves this generation quality at significantly lower computational cost. As shown in Table 3, HART achieves 9.3 higher throughput compared to SD3-medium (Esser et al., 2024) at 512512 resolution. For 10241024 generation, HART achieves at least 3.1 lower latency than state-of-the-art diffusion models. Compared to the similarly sized PixArt-Î£ (Chen et al., 2024a), our method achieves 3.6 faster latency and 5.6 higher throughput, which closely aligns with the theoretical 5.8 reduction in MACs. Compared to SDXL, HART not only achieves superior quality across all benchmarks in Table 2, but also demonstrates 3.1 lower latency and 4.5 higher throughput. Class-conditioned generation. Table 4 presents our class-to-image generation results. HART outperforms MAR-L (Li et al., 2024b) in terms of FID and inception score, while requiring 10.7 fewer MACs and achieving 12.9 lower latency. Across all model sizes, HART demonstrates 4.3-7.8% improvement in FID and consistent enhancement in inception score. For larger models (d 24), the residual diffusion overhead accounts for only 4-11% of the total runtime. HART also compares favorably to DiT-XL/2 (Peebles & Xie, 2023), with our largest model being 3.3 faster, even when DiT employs 20-step sampler. 4.3 ABLATION STUDIES AND ANALYSIS Depth Res. tokens FID 20 20 2.67 297.3 2.39 316.

The HART-VAR results are obtained by omitting residual diffusion from the full HART model. Left: class-to-image, right: text-to-image, : results obtained using the official VAR quantizer. We evaluate the key design choices in HART by examining: the effectiveness and efficiency of residual diffusion, the impact of our alternating training strategy for the hybrid tokenizer, and the importance of the scalable-resolution AR transformer. Residual diffusion: effectiveness. Table 5 demonstrates the effectiveness of learning residual tokens in HART. For ImageNet 256256 generation, residual diffusion yields 10-14% improvement in FID and up to 6.4% increase in inception score compared to the baseline model, HART-VAR. Preprint, work in progress Figure 7: Left: residual tokens in HART are much easier to learn than full tokens in MAR. Middle/Right: Despite achieving similar reconstruction FID, single decoder with alternating training enables faster and better generation convergence. Figure 8: Scalable-resolution transformer accelerates convergence when finetuning HART at higher resolution thanks to relative position embeddings that supports resolution interpolation. We constructed HART-VAR using the publicly available VAR codebase, which resulted in slightly lower discrete-only performance than reported in Tian et al. (2024). For text-conditioned generation on MJHQ-30K, FID improved by 11.1% at 256px and 17.0% at 512px. At 1024px, where the original VAR tokenizer shows poor reconstruction performance  (Table 1)  , HART achieves 31% FID improvement. Even compared to the stronger discrete-only HART tokenizer, residual diffusion still offers 6.1% FID improvement. Figure 3 visualizes the residual tokens, illustrating how residual diffusion enhances discrete tokens with high-resolution details. Residual diffusion: efficiency. Figure 7 (left) demonstrates that HARTs approach of learning residual tokens is significantly more efficient than MARs method of learning full tokens. Notably, HART achieves higher inception score with just 3 diffusion sampling steps compared to MARs 60 denoising steps, resulting in 20 reduction in runtime for continuous token learning. Alternating training in hybrid tokenizer. We explored various strategies to train the hybrid tokenizer while maintaining similar continuous rFID. Figure 7 (middle and right) compares our current approach (single decoder with alternating training) to using separate decoders for continuous and discrete latents, with the discrete decoder frozen. Our design offers faster, better convergence for class-conditioned image generation. Alternative strategies, such as finetuning the entire hybrid tokenizer from pretrained continuous tokenizer or decoding only continuous latents during training, are proven to be as bad as the separate decoder solution. Scalable-resolution transformer. Lastly, Figure 8 illustrates that substituting all absolute PEs in VAR with relative PEs significantly enhances convergence when fine-tuning HART at higher resolutions from pretrained low-resolution checkpoints. Given that the token count in HART increases by 4 (resulting in 16 increase in attention computation) when the output image resolution doubles, this accelerated convergence is crucial for maintaining manageable training costs."

            "content": "We introduce HART (Hybrid Autoregressive Transformer), an early autoregressive model capable of directly generating 10241024 images from text prompts without super-resolution. HART achieves quality comparable to diffusion models while being 3.1-5.9 faster and offering 4.5-7.7 higher throughput. Our key insight lies in the decomposition of continuous image latents through hybrid tokenization, producing discrete tokens that capture the overall structure and residual tokens that refine image details. We model the discrete tokens using scalable-resolution AR transformer, 10 Preprint, work in progress while lightweight residual diffusion module with just 37M parameters and 8 sampling steps learns the residual tokens. We believe HART will catalyze new research into modeling both discrete and continuous tokens for sequence-based visual generation."

A.1 ATTENTION PATTERN ANALYSIS We visualize the attention patterns of pretrained VAR (Tian et al., 2024) in Figure 9. Our empirical analysis reveals that for each VAR stage (i.e., sampling step), the attention score is predominantly concentrated on three key areas: the current stage, the preceding stage, and the initial three stages. Within the current stage, where the attention score is highest, we further examine the spatial attention map, as depicted in the rightmost three subfigures of Figure 9. Interestingly, despite the VAR attention mechanism allowing all tokens within the last stage to interact, the attention map exhibits surprisingly localized pattern: each token primarily attends to its immediate neighbors, similar to convolution operations. This observation has important implications. Even when we significantly reduce the number of tokens in the last stage during training (by up to 80%), the fundamental attention pattern remains intact due to the limited global interaction between tokens. This explains why the partial supervision approach during training (discussed in Section 3.3) does not compromise generation quality. We have also empirically verified that explicitly restricting attention patterns to the first 3 stages plus 2 local stages during training does not impact final results. Consequently, implementing sparse attention kernel to further accelerate training is feasible, which we leave as future direction. 16 Preprint, work in progress Figure 11: Additional 10241024 text-to-image generation results with HART.

Full prompt for example 5: beautiful lady, freckles, big smile, blue eyes, short ginger hair, dark makeup, wearing floral blue vest top, soft light, dark grey background. 18 Preprint, work in progress Figure 13: 256256 class-conditional generation results from HART on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). 19 Preprint, work in progress A.2 MORE VISUALIZATIONS Figure 14: Additional image reconstruction comparison among VAR (discrete), MAR (KL-16, continuous) and HART (hybrid) tokenizers. Figure 10 demonstrates the significant impact of direct synthesis at 10241024 resolution: the 1024px generated images exhibit substantially more details compared to their 512px counterparts. Figures 11 and 12 demonstrate text-conditioned generation. HART produce these images with comparable quality to diffusion models, while offering up to 7.7 higher throughput. In Figure 13, we also showcase additional visualizations of HART-generated images for class-conditioned generation. Finally, Figure 14 presents additional image reconstruction results for various tokenizers. The HART tokenizer demonstrates reconstruction performance comparable to MARs continuous tokenizer, while significantly outperforming VARs discrete tokenizer."
