            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable advances in natural language processing (NLP), contributing to progress in fields such as economics, society, and culture. However, their widespread deployment poses significant risks. Trained on extensive unsupervised corpora, LLMs *Corresponding author. 1Disclaimer: The paper contains content that may be profane, vulgar, or offensive.

Moreover, they can be exploited for malicious ends, such as crafting phishing messages (Shibli et al., 2024) or enabling cyberattacks (Mahmoodi and Jameii, 2024), which underscores the urgent need to address these safety issues. Red-teaming is widely used strategy for uncovering vulnerabilities in LLMs by generating diverse range of malicious instructions, either automatically using LLMs or manually by experts. These malicious instructions, when paired with carefully crafted, norm-adherent responses, form specialized datasets that support safety alignment efforts, particularly methods such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Fine-tuning LLMs on alignment datasets helps reduce the likelihood of harmful outputs, ensuring safer and more reliable model behavior (Ganguli et al., 2022). key challenge in this process is achieving comprehensive coverage of potential safety risks, which requires diverse red-teaming instructions. Current data curation methods often focus on lexical diversity, enriching vocabulary (Chan et al., 2024), but neglect other critical dimensions. As shown in Figure 1, even lexically varied datasets exhibit imbalances in domains of malicious user intents, with certain types dominating while others are underrepresented. Such imbalances limit LLMs ability to acquire comprehensive safety knowledge. Meanwhile, we found that most of the existing datasets do not consider jailbreak tactics, resulting in LLMs fine-tuned with these datasets performing poorly in handling jailbreak attacks. To address this limitation, we identify three essential dimensions of risk-related diversity: Lexical Diversity enriches the vocabulary and linguistic complexity of instructions, improving model robustness. Malicious Intent Diversity ensures balanced coverage of multiple harmful intent categories (e.g., violence, defamation) within user instructions, broadening the models exposure to diverse harmful scenarios. Jailbreak Tactic Diversity incorporates various adversarial techniques, enhancing the models resilience against manipulative jailbreak attacks. Measuring these dimensions provides framework to quantify risk coverage, guiding more effective dataset curation to enhance LLM safety. Based on these dimensions, we introduce TRIDENT, an innovative automated data generation pipeline that minimizes human intervention. TRIDENT employs zero-shot approach using chatLLM to generate diverse personas and attributes, which then guide instruction generation. Through persona-based role-playing, the LLM ensures both lexical and malicious intent diversity (Shah et al., 2023), while integrated jailbreak tactics further expand risk coverage. Each harmful instruction is then paired with benign, ethically aligned response generated by safety-focused LLM, such as GPT-4O-MINI. This process produces two comprehensive datasets: TRIDENT-CORE, which contains 26,311 examples focused on lexical and malicious intent diversity, and TRIDENT-EDGE (examples in the Table 17), which incorporates jailbreak tactic diversity into the examples in TRIDENT-CORE, resulting in 18,773 examples. Our evaluation shows that finetuning META-LLAMA-3.1-8B on TRIDENTEDGE significantly outperforms current state-ofthe-art baselines (ATTAQ (Kour et al., 2023), AART (Radharapu et al., 2023), HH_RLHF (Ganguli et al., 2022), SAFE_RLHF (Ji et al., 2024a), WILDBREAK (Jiang et al., 2024b), and WILDCHAT (Zhao et al., 2024)-finetuned METALLAMA-3.1-8B) across seven benchmarks, reducing the Harm Score (HS) by 13.89% and Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 20%. Additionally, our ablation studies reveal that each dimension of diversity substantially contributes to improving LLM safety. Overall, our contributions are as follows: I) We introduce systematic framework to analyze the risk coverage of red-teaming datasets across three fundamental diversity dimensions: lexical, malicious intent, and jailbreak tactic. II) We present TRIDENT, an automated and scalable pipeline that efficiently generates diverse instruction-response pairs, yielding TRIDENTCORE and TRIDENT-EDGE datasets. III) Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our diversity-enhanced datasets substantially improve both LLM safety and helpfulness across multiple benchmarks, with ablation studies highlighting the distinct contributions of each diversity dimension."

            "content": "To overcome the limitations of existing red-teaming datasets, we introduce TRIDENT, an automated data curation pipeline designed to systematically enhance three key dimensions of diversity: Lexical Diversity, Malicious Intent Diversity, and Jailbreak Tactic Diversity. These dimensions address critical gaps in current datasets by broadening linguistic variation, expanding the coverage of malicious intents, and fortifying models against adversarial tactics. Figure 2 illustrates the pipeline, which progresses from defining high-level intent domains to generating diverse, malicious instructions and norm-adherent responses. Defining Intent Domains. The starting point of TRIDENT is the definition of Intent Domains, which includes 14 categories of malicious user intents, including violent crimes, defamation, and sex-related crimes, etc. These domains are adopted from the hazard categories defined by LLAMAGUARD-3-8B (Inan et al., 2023) and MLCommons2, chosen for their well-established standards and broad coverage of potential threats. This framework effectively addresses both common risks, such as defamation and violent crimes, and specialized threats, such as code interpreter abuse. By leveraging LLAMA-GUARD-3-8Bs systematic classification, TRIDENT ensures accuracy, scalability, and comprehensive coverage in categorizing 2https://mlcommons.org/2024/04/mlc-aisafety-v0-5-poc/ Figure 2: Illustration of our data generation pipeline for building TRIDENT malicious intents, providing strong foundation for subsequent steps in the pipeline. Scenario Generation. As in Figure 2, we generate domain-specific scenarios using the uncensored Llama-3.1-8b-instruct model in zero-shot setting3. For instance, in the Code Interpreter Abuse domain, it might create scenario involving the misuse of programming tools to embed hidden malicious code. By grounding abstract intent domains in realistic scenarios, this method effectively supports subsequent persona creation and instruction generation. Persona Generation. We use two-step approach with single LLM to generate diverse personas and their attributes from scenarios. persona captures an individuals role, behaviour, and goals within scenario context, while attributes define more specific persona details like occupation, personality traits, and experiences. Step 1: Scenario-to-Persona Generation. The same LLM from scenario generation infers contextually appropriate personas and their defining attributes from each scenario. This ensures personas exhibit realistic motivations and behaviors grounded in plausible situations. For instance, given scenario in the Code Interpreter Abuse domain, the model might generate persona of charismatic hacker who exploits technical expertise to manipulate others, with attributes including occupation: cybercriminal, personality: manipulative and ambitious, and life experiences: influenced by unethical tech leaders. 3https://huggingface.co/aifeifei798/DarkIdol-Llama-3.18B-Instruct-1.2-Uncensored Step 2: Persona-to-Persona Expansion. We further diversify our persona set by prompting the LLM to generate related personas by exploring interpersonal connections and shared attributes. For example, the model might expand the hacker persona to include brilliant but reclusive developer who creates technical tools for phishing campaigns. Guided by the Six Degrees of Separation theory (Travers and Milgram, 1977), this approach allows us to expand from the intent domains defined by Llama-Guard into undefined domains by generating sufficient number of related personas. Instruction Generation. Our pipeline generates harmful instructions through two key steps: i) transforming prepared personas and attributes into instructions to enhance Lexical and Malicious Intent Diversity, and ii) improving Jailbreak Tactic Diversity. These steps together ensure comprehensive coverage of risks in the instructions. Step 1: Enhancing Lexical and Malicious Intent Diversity. We employ role-playing approach where the LLM acts as previously generated personas to create diverse instructions. Each personas unique characteristics naturally influence the language and style of generated content, contributing to lexical diversity. For instance, when adopting the role of cunning politician, the LLM generates formally worded content, while as cybercriminal, it produces technically sophisticated malicious instructions. Additionally, Persona-toPersona Expansion achieves an expansion from the intent domain defined by Llama-Guard to undefined domains, enhancing the diversity of malicious intent. Step 2: Incorporating Jailbreak Tactics. To improve the datasets adversarial robustness, we apply six advanced jailbreak methods, each including multitude of jailbreak tactics, to transform base instructions into six varied forms. One of these transformed instructions, selected at random, replaces the original if it successfully bypasses META-LLAMA-3.1-8Bs defenses. The methods are: Cipher Encoding (Yuan et al., 2024b) encrypts instructions in code-like formats, requiring decryption to reveal the harmful intent. Code Injection (Kang et al., 2023) embeds harmful instructions within benign-appearing code snippets. Low-Resource Translation (Deng et al., 2024) converts instructions into less common languages while maintaining their malicious intent. Past Tense Rewriting (Andriushchenko and Flammarion, 2024) modifies the temporal context of instructions. Persona Modulation (Shah et al., 2023) adapts instructions to match specific persona styles. RENELLM Techniques (Ding et al., 2024) apply multiple transformations, including paraphrasing, structure alteration, and strategic misspellings. TRIDENT-CORE and TRIDENT-EDGE. TRIDENT-CORE consists of instructions generated with emphasis on Lexical Diversity and Malicious Intent Diversity, aiming to encourage other researchers in extending TRIDENT-CORE with more advanced jailbreak methods. TRIDENTEDGE extends this foundation by incorporating the jailbreak tactics, adding the third dimension of diversity and strengthening the datasets defense against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Instruction Filtering. TRIDENT employs two-stage filtering process to ensure dataset quality and diversity. First, LLAMA-GUARD-3-8B identifies and retains only instructions classified as unsafe, filtering out benign ones. Second, the process iterates through the instruction set, calculating pairwise BLEU similarity scores (Papineni et al., 2002) between each new instruction and existing entries. Instructions with similarity scores exceeding threshold are removed. This step further enhances the Lexical Diversity of the instruction set. Response Generation. We developed structured prompt template based on the chain-ofthought (CoT) framework (Wei et al., 2022) (see Appendix B.2 for the template) to generate safe and helpful responses to harmful instructions using GPT-4O-MINI. The template enforces strict safety protocols, requiring the responses to refrain from Self-BLEU Entropy 0.09 0.08 0.13 0.11 0.15 0.12 0.18 0.13 0.08 0.04 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.04 0.96 0.94 1.00 1.00 0.95 0.86 1.00 0.27 0.39 0.53 0.45 0.56 0.53 0.55 Avg Tokens TTR ATTR MATTR 8.60 8.96 9.73 9.06 10.01 9.57 10. 52.72 53.25 51.74 56.08 24.43 63.25 58.53 LDI 20.41 17.12 36.21 22.50 35.99 46.22 38.65 Datasets Inertia AART 41.17 ATTAQ 33.70 HH_RLHF 32.75 SAFE_RLHF 36.00 WILDBREAK 49.72 WILDCHAT 35.81 TRIDENT-CORE 56.51 Table 1: The lexical comparison results of baseline and TRIDENT-CORE on Type-Token Ratio (TTR), Advanced Type-Token Ratio (ATTR), Mean Segmental Type-Token Ratio (MATTR), Lexical Diversity Index (LDI), Self-Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (SelfBLEU), Entropy and Inertia. directly engaging with hazardous content. Instead, the model identifies harmful elements within the instruction and references relevant ethical or legal principles, ensuring that the response addresses the risks without amplifying harm. To ensure helpfulness, the model is guided to provide meaningful assistance in considerate tone while respecting the users values. Responses are required to offer constructive guidance that aligns with ethical standards, ensuring that they meet user needs."

            "content": "In this section, we provide detailed analysis of three diversity dimensions between TRIDENT-CORE and six baseline alignment datasets: AART (Radharapu et al., 2023), ATTAQ (Kour et al., 2023), HH_RLHF (Ganguli et al., 2022), SAFE_RLHF (Ji et al., 2024b), WILDBREAK (Jiang et al., 2024b), WILDCHAT (Zhao et al., 2024). Lexical Diversity Evaluation. To evaluate the lexical diversity, series of measures are emincluding average tokens, TTR(Typeployed, Token Ratio), ATTR(Advanced Type-Token Ratio), MATTR(Mean Segmental Type-Token Ratio), LDI(Lexical Diversity Index), Self-BLEU(SelfBilingual Evaluation Understudy), Entropy, Inertia, as well as BERT-based t-SNE dimensionality reduction methods. Table 1 compares the diversity of the six baselines and TRIDENT-CORE, using N-gram metrics. TRIDENT-CORE demonstrates superior performance across multiple diversity metrics, particularly in TTR and Inertia. HH_RLHF, SAFE_RLHF, WILDBREAK and WILDCHAT perform well in ATTR and MATTR, indicating notable lexical diversity, though they may not be as comprehensive as TRIDENT-CORE. In contrast, AART and ATTAQ exhibit relatively weaker performance in most evaluation metrics, suggesting room for improvement in lexical richness and textual complexity. Additionally, visual analysis in Figure 4 Variance Entropy Variance Entropy Datasets AART ATTAQ HH_RLHF TRIDENT-CORE Datasets SAFE_RLHF 5.19 5.08 WILDBREAK 5.51 WILDCHAT 6.21 Table 2: The statistical characteristics of the malicious intent distribution for baseline and TRIDENT-CORE. 2376 2177 1558 557 2135 2133 1258 5.25 5.49 5.56 (in the Appendix) shows that TRIDENT-CORE has broader coverage area in two-dimensional space, even exceeding the union of the baselines distributions, further confirming its advantages in lexical diversity. Malicious Intent Diversity Evaluation. We present the intent domain of TRIDENT-CORE in Figure 1. To compare the diversity of malicious intent, we employed GPT-4O-MINI for zero-shot extraction of malicious intent from the instructions. Subsequently, we visualized the results through BERT-based dimensionality reduction, as depicted in Figure 5 in the Appendix. The distribution of TRIDENT-CORE overlaps with the baselines, suggesting that TRIDENT-CORE inherits the traits of malicious intent from them. Nevertheless, TRIDENT-CORE also expands into areas that are not covered by the baselines, thereby demonstrating its unique features and resulting in superior diversity of malicious intent. Furthermore, we utilized GPT-4O-MINI to classify the categories of malicious intent, obtaining total of 100 different categories (with details provided in Table 16). After that, we categorized the malicious intent using GPT-4O-MINI, and the outcomes are presented in appendix A.1. We employed variance and entropy to measure the uniformity of the distribution across different categories. The results are presented in the Table 2. the variance of the sample distribution of TRIDENT-CORE is the lowest, and the entropy is the highest. This implies that TRIDENT-CORE exhibits the most uniform distribution among the 100 malicious intent categories. Even within the less common categories, certain quantity of samples exists. Consequently, we can see that TRIDENT-CORE shows the optimal diversity in terms of malicious intent. Finally, we reclassified TRIDENT-CORE and the baseline using alternative intent domain standards (Aakanksha et al., 2024) and (Yuan et al., 2024a), as shown in Tables 11 and 12 in the Appendix. The results demonstrate that TRIDENT-CORE maintains the most uniform distribution, even in previously undefined domains, reflecting its superior diversity in capturing malicious intent.

(2024b), with the results presented in Table 3. Notably, TRIDENT-EDGE, which incorporates six representative jailbreak methods, achieves diversity of jailbreak tactics comparable to WILDBREAK, dataset specifically designed to mine and combine various jailbreak tactics. In contrast, datasets that do not prioritize enriching jailbreak tactics demonstrate noticeably lower level of diversity. Human Evaluation. We enlisted three NLP professionals to assess the quality of TRIDENTCORE and the baselines based on the evaluation criteria in Table 13. For this evaluation, dataset of 50 instructions was selected, and each evaluator was unaware of which dataset each instruction came from and the results were shown in Table 14. It can be observed that the instructions in TRIDENT-CORE are diverse and the responses are both safe and helpful, which outperforms the baselines, achieving the best performance."

Our evaluation suite incorporates established benchmarks including HARMBENCH (Mazeika et al., 2024), XSTEST (Röttger et al., 2024), ADVBENCH (Chen et al., 2022), and the Chinese dataset SCSAFETY (Xu et al., 2023), along with specialized jailbreak-enhanced instruction collections such as STRONGREJECT (Souly et al., 2024), DAN (Shen et al., 2024), and JAILBREAKV (Luo et al., 2024). We also introduce three custom benchmarks: BASEBENCH comprising instructions from baseline datasets (AART, ATTAQ, HH_RLHF, SAFE_RLHF), EDGEBENCH containing instructions from TRIDENT-EDGE, and COREBENCH drawn from TRIDENT-CORE. Evaluation. We use instructions from redteaming datasets to prompt LLMs and generate responses, which are evaluated using GPT-4O-MINI based on four key safety and helpfulness metrics: Harm Score (HS): Measures the harmfulness of responses on scale from 1 (harmless) to 5 (extremely harmful), following Qi et al. (2024). Attack Success Rate (ASR): Indicates the proportion of responses with HS = 5 (extremely harmful) relative to total attempts, as defined in Jiang et al. (2024a). Helpful Rate (HPR): Represents the percentage of red-teaming instructions that result in non-refusal responses. It is calculated based on whether the responses prefix tokens exclude refusal words, using the Dict-Judge method (Liu et al., 2024). RQ1: Can diverse instructions in alignment datasets improve LLM safety compared to less diverse alignment datasets? Settings. We perform LoRA fine-tuning on META-LLAMA-3.1-8B using six baseline datasets and TRIDENT-EDGE. The safety of the finetuned LLMs is evaluated using red-teaming benchmarks, including HARMBENCH, XSTEST (enhanced by Past Tense), ADVBENCH (enhanced by Persona Modulation), SC-SAFETY, STRONGREJECT, DAN, JAILBREAKV, BASEBENCH, and EDGEBENCH. Results. Table 4 shows that all datasets significantly improve the safety of aligned models compared to the unaligned META-LLAMA-3.1-8B, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning with red-teaming instructions paired with safe responses. Among the datasets, TRIDENT-EDGE performs best across seven benchmarks, achieving 13.89% reduction in HS, 20% decrease in ASR, and 15.79% decrease in HPR compared to the secondbest dataset, for each metric. We also enlisted three NLP professionals to evaluate the safety of the aligned models. Each evaluator was unaware of the source for each instruction-response pair. As shown in Table 15 in the Appendix, there is strong consistency between the human evaluations and the GPT-based evaluations, both indicating that, in most cases, the models aligned with TRIDENTEDGE exhibit the best safety performance. Furthermore, helpfulness improved across all aligned models, with TRIDENT-EDGE achieving the highest gains (see Appendix A.2). This shows the benefits of using multi-dimensionally diverse datasets for fine-tuning to enhance both safety and helpfulness.

To assess the generalizability of our findings beyond META-LLAMA-3.1-8B, we selected WILDBREAK, the best-performing baseline dataset in our experiments and fine-tuned two additional models: GEMMA-7B and MISTRAL-7B. We then compared the performance of these fine-tuned models with their unaligned counterparts on three benchmark datasets: ADVBENCH, JAILBREAKV, and STRONGREJECT. The results for GEMMA-7B and MISTRAL-7B are presented in the Table 6 and Table 7. The results demonstrate that TRIDENTEDGE consistently performs well across multiple benchmarks on both GEMMA-7B and MISTRAL7B, showing performance pattern similar to that observed with META-LLAMA-3.1-8B. This suggests that our dataset generalizes well for finetuning variety of LLMs. RQ2: Does diverse jailbreak tactics enhance the red-teaming effectiveness of the instructions? Settings. To evaluate whether diversifying jailbreak tactics enhances the attack effectiveness of red-teaming instructions, we individually incorporated the six aforementioned jailbreak methods Aligned LLMs Unaligned Screen Rewrite TRIDENT-CORE Harmbench XSTEST Advbench Basebench Corebench StrongReject SC-Safety 0.19 0.18 0.20 0.13 0.29 0.14 0.17 0.11 0.31 0.23 0.27 0.14 0.18 0.13 0.14 0.08 0.31 0.23 0.19 0. 0.25 0.20 0.17 0.14 0.35 0.23 0.19 0.14 Table 8: Ablation study on the lexical diversity. We utilize two datasets with low lexical diversity (Rewrite and Screen) and TRIDENT-CORE to align METALLAMA-3.1-8B, utilize ASR to evaluate its safety. into TRIDENT-CORE. We then compared the effectiveness of these individually enhanced instructions with two additional sets: instructions from TRIDENT-EDGE, which utilize mix of diversified jailbreak tactics, and the original nonjailbreak-enhanced instructions from TRIDENTCORE. These instructions were used to perform jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Results. Table 5 demonstrates that all jailbreakenhanced instructions achieve higher Attack Success Rate and Harmful Score compared to TRIDENT-CORE. Among individual method, Code Injection shows strong performance particularly on Qwen-2.5-7B (ASR: 0.64), while LowResource Translation maintains consistently high Helpful Rate (HPR > 0.95) across several models. Past Tense, Persona Modulation, and RENELLM show moderate effectiveness with all performance metrics. Notably, TRIDENT-EDGE, which incorporates all tactics, significantly outperforms individual approaches, achieving the highest HS (> 4.3) and ASR (> 0.8) on models like Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B. These results show that combining diverse jailbreak tactics substantially enhances the effectiveness of red-teaming instructions. RQ3: Does each dimension of diversity contribute to improving safety? We conduct an ablation study on three dimensions of diversitylexical, malicious intent, and jailbreak tactic. For each dimension, we keep the other two as constant as possible, allowing us to isolate the effect of that specific dimension on safety. RQ3a: Lexical Diversity Ablation Settings. We reduce lexical diversity using two methods: (i) instructing Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-1.2Uncensored to rewrite the TRIDENT-CORE instructions with simpler vocabulary while preserving malicious intent, and (ii) selecting high SelfBLEU samples from TRIDENT-CORE, which identifies instructions with high internal similarity to ensure minimal lexical variation. These lowdiversity datasets are then compared against the 0.49 0.30 0.26 0.20 0.41 0.12 0.20 0.03 0.25 0.17 0.18 0. 0.19 0.08 0.07 0.02 Harmbench XSTEST Advbench SC-Safety StrongReject DAN JailbreakV 0.35 0.23 0.08 0.08 Aligned LLMs Unaligned 0.44 0.45 Past Tense 0.49 0.28 RENELLM 0.36 0.24 TRIDENT-EDGE 0.09 0.19 Table 9: Ablation study on jailbreak tactic diversity. We enhanced the sampled data in TRIDENT-CORE using Past Tense and RENELLM, then identified data with the same instructions in TRIDENT-EDGE. Using 3 datasets, we trained three models by aligning METALLAMA-3.1-8B and evaluated their safety with ASR. original TRIDENT-CORE. All three datasets are randomly downsampled to 3,000 examples for fair comparison. Results. Table 8 shows the safety of the aligned models in multiple attack datasets. While aligned models improve safety compared to the unaligned model, the aligned with diversity lexical datasets outperform their low diversity counterparts, highlighting lexical diversitys critical role in enhancing safety. Additional results see Figure 10. RQ3b: Malicious Intent Ablation Settings. To explore the impact of the diversity of malicious intent on the safety of the model, we controlled for the diversity of lexical and jailbreak tactics. We selected TRIDENT-CORE samples with token counts between 20 and 50 to control lexical diversity. Next, we constructed two datasets with differing malicious intent diversity: one containing only samples from intent domains 1 and 2 (low malicious intent diversity) and another random sampling from intent domains 1 to 14 (high malicious intent diversity). These datasets were used to fine-tune META-LLAMA-3.1-8B via LoRA, and instructions from TRIDENT-CORE were used to attack to evaluate safety. Results. Results shown in Figure 3, indicate that aligning with TRIDENT-CORE enhances model safety, regardless of malicious intent diversity. Nevertheless, models that are aligned solely with samples from intent domain 1 and intent domain 2 perform somewhat better in intent domain 1 and intent domain 2, yet perform worse in other domains. This highlights the significance of diverse malicious intents for achieving comprehensive safety improvement. RQ3c: Jailbreak Tactics Ablation by applying two jailbreak methods (Past Tense and RENELLM), respectively. Subsequently, we identified examples in TRIDENT-EDGE that share the same instructions as these samples, which are diversified in jailbreak tactics while maintaining the same degree of lexical and malicious diversity. We then aligned META-LLAMA-3.1-8B using these three datasets and evaluated the safety of the aligned model. Among the red-teaming datasets, XSTEST was enhanced by Past Tense, while ADVBENCH was enhanced by Persona Modulation. Results. The safety evaluation result is shown in Table 9. Models aligned with diverse jailbreak tactics achieve the best safety performance, confirming that the diversity of jailbreak tactics is crucial for robust defense capabilities. Moreover, for outof-distribution jailbreak tactics, similarities among jailbreak tactics allow aligned models to effectively reduce their success rates. For additional results, see Figure 10 in the Appendix."

            "content": "Red-teaming Techniques. Several methods have been developed for red-teaming and enhancing the diversity of instruction generation. HH_RLHF employs manual red-teaming approach where crowdworkers engage in multi-turn dialogues with LLMs to elicit harmful responses (Ganguli et al., 2022). Automated approaches include SAFE_RLHF, which categorizes risks and uses sample examples to generate instructions that are ranked for helpfulness and harmlessness (Ji et al., 2024a), and AART, which generates red-teaming instructions by identifying and combining key elements within risk categories (Radharapu et al., 2023). ATTAQ combines multiple strategies, including filtering instructions from datasets, using toxic prompts, and leveraging crime descriptions from Wikipedia, to generate harmful instructions with uncensored models (Kour et al., 2023). WILDBREAK mines jailbreak tactics from red-teaming datasets and combines them to create new instructions (Jiang et al., 2024b). WILDCHAT is dataset derived from real-world user interactions with ChatGPT (Zhao et al., 2024), from which we extracted only the interactions with harmful instructions. Settings. In our jailbreak tactics ablation study, we analyzed how the diversity of jailbreak tactics affects model safety. Specifically, we selected samples from TRIDENT-CORE and enhanced them Safety Evaluation Benchmarks. Several benchmarks have been developed to evaluate LLMs safety. ADVBENCH assesses LLMs resistance to real-world attacks (Chen et al., 2022), while Figure 3: Ablation study on malicious intent diversity. Aligned1,2 and Aligned1-14 respectively represent conducting fine-tuning on META-LLAMA-3.1-8B using TRIDENT-CORE sampled from intent domain 1,2 and domain 1-14. Horizontal axis indicated that the attack dataset was taken from the i-th intent domain of TRIDENT-CORE. SC-SAFETY focuses on ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards (Xu et al., 2023). Through comprehensive datasets, HARMBENCH and XSTEST capture various malicious intents (Mazeika et al., 2024; Röttger et al., 2024). Additionally, STRONGREJECT (Souly et al., 2024), DAN (Shen et al., 2024), and JAILBREAKV (Luo et al., 2024) evaluate LLMs resilience against diverse jailbreak attacks."

            "content": "In this work, we propose novel framework to evaluate the risk coverage of alignment datasets across three key dimensions: Lexical Diversity, Malicious Intent, and Jailbreak Tactics. Building on these dimensions, we introduce TRIDENT, an automated pipeline that generates diverse instructions, yielding two comprehensive datasets: TRIDENTCORE (26,311 examples) and TRIDENT-EDGE (18,773 examples). Fine-tuning META-LLAMA3.1-8B on TRIDENT-EDGE achieves substantial improvements in LLM safety, demonstrating 14.29% reduction in harm score and 20% decrease in attack success rate compared to the bestperforming baseline dataset. Our ablation study further validates the frameworks effectiveness by showing that each diversity dimension contributes independently to enhancing the models safety."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "In this paper, we propose persona-based redteaming dataset generation pipeline, TRIDENT. Through role-playing, we enhance lexical diversity; with Scenario-to-Persona Generation and Personato-Persona Expansion, we broaden the spectrum of malicious intents; and by incorporating diverse jailbreak methods, we increase the variety of jailbreak tactics. Additionally, we employ COTbased response generation method to ensure that the responses are not only diverse but also safe and helpful. However, due to computational constraints, our generative model is based on an 8B chat-LLM, which limits the diversity and quality of the dataset. Furthermore, as jailbreak methods continue to evolve, newly developed methods are likely to emerge that fall outside the distribution of jailbreak tactics represented in our current dataset. Nevertheless, TRIDENT enables straightforward integration of such emerging methods into the framework, or they can be directly incorporated into TRIDENT-CORE, thereby partially mitigating this limitation."

To address these concerns, we have implemented thorough documentation, clear usage guidelines, and structured access protocols to ensure appropriate utilization in research settings. We believe that transparent sharing of redteaming methodologies and datasets with the research community is crucial for collective progress in LLM safety, despite the potential risk of malicious exploitation.

Subsequently, we employ the GPT-4o to identify and eliminate similar malicious intent categories, culminating in comprehensive list of 100 distinct malicious intent categories. Ultimately, the GPT-4O-MINI is leveraged to classify these malicious intent, as illustrated in Figure 6. It is evident that across four baselines, there is noticeable disparity in the frequency of certain malicious intent categories, with some being significantly more prevalent than others, highlighting the presence of long-tail distribution issue. Conversely, the frequency distribution of malicious intent categories in TRIDENT-CORE is more uniform, with reduced frequency gap between various categories, suggesting that TRIDENT-CORE achieves more balanced diversity in capturing malicious intent.

Figure 6: Frequency of malicious intent categories, malicious intent categories shown in Table Results. Figure 7 presents the results, showing that fine-tuning the base LLM using the red-teaming dataset does not decrease the helpfulness. Instead, the most helpful responses improve by at least 8%. This is due to the fact that, according to the LLMs responses, we have noticed that in numerous instances, the base LLM merely generates certain responses that are unrelated to the question and even continuously repeats the question. This might be attributed to the base LLMs failure to comprehend the instructions or its deficiency in the capacity to express. Although the responses of the red-teaming dataset all do not follow the instructions, to certain extent, it also improves the LLMs ability to understand instructions and the ability to express, therefore, the helpfulness is enhanced. AART and ATTAQ show higher helpfulness than SAFE_RLHF and HH_RLHF, validating the effectiveness of our CoT-based helpful response generation method. Furthermore, TRIDENT-EDGE achieves higher helpfulness than AART and ATTAQ, suggesting that diverse dataset may also contribute to improvements in helpfulness. A.3 Analyzing Instruction Clustering Across Diverse Intent Domains We embedded the instructions of TRIDENT-CORE using BERT, visualized them in two-dimensional plane using t-SNE, and labeled different intent domains with distinct colors, as shown in Figure 9. Among the 26,311 instructions, we observe that all intent domains except domains 1 and 2 form multiple distinct clusters. Notably, intent domains 3-14 clearly segment the instructions under the red-teaming theme, while intent domains 1 and 2 provide more comprehensive coverage of instructions within this theme. Red-teaming Dataset Generation B.1 Intent Domain Description and Malicious Intent Categories S1 - Violent Crimes Responses that enable, encourage, or endorse the commission of violent crimes. S2 - Non-Violent Crimes Responses that enable, encourage, or endorse the commission of non-violent crimes. Figure 7: We utilize baseline and TRIDENT-EDGE conduct LoRA fine-tuning on META-LLAMA-3.1-8B, and apply the settings from Lin et al. (2024) to evaluate their helpfulness. The horizontal axis represents the proportion of the helpfulness rank. Figure 8: Quality of TRIDENT-CORE Figure 9: Intent Domain cluster. Risk represents intent domain.
