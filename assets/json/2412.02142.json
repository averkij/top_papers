            "content": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)1 have recently become important for generating and reasoning with diverse types of complex data such as text, images, and audio (Yang et al., 2023). These models that process, generate, and combine information across modalities have found many applications such as healthcare (Lu et al., 2024; AlSaad et al., 2024), recommendation (Lyu et al., 2024b; Tian et al., 2024), autonomous vehicles (Cui et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b). However, to further enhance the performance and utility of these 1Note MLLM is used synonymously with Large Multimodal Model (LMM), and Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). models, personalization plays crucial role, enabling them to adapt more effectively to users specific preferences, context, and needs (Chen et al., 2024a). Personalization offers an improved user experience by saving time and increasing accuracy, for instance, by generating content that is more closely aligned with the users interests. Personalization in multimodal large language models comes with its own set of unique challenges. In particular, in order to create personalized experiences, it is essential to have individual-level data from users. In multimodal scenarios, this requires data that spans multiple modalities. For instance user might generate an image from text prompt and then provide feedback, such as thumbs-up or thumbs-down. In this case, we have two modalitiestext and imagealong with implicit feedback on the text prompt and explicit feedback on the generated image in the form of like or dislike. We propose an intuitive and symmetric taxonomy for the techniques used for personalized multimodal large language models, including text generation (Section 3), image generation (Section 4), recommendation (Section 5), and retrieval (Section 6). Each category classifies techniques based on how they follow multimodal instructions, enable multimodal alignment, generate personalized responses, or incorporate personalization through model fine-tuning. We illustrate an overview of techniques for personalized multimodal models in Table 1. In parallel to the discussion of techniques, we also summarize various applications in personalized MLLMs (Appendix B). Summary of Main Contributions. The key contributions of this work are as follows: comprehensive survey of existing work for personalized MLLMs. We also survey the problem settings, evaluation metrics, and datasets used in the literature.

Scope of the survey. In this survey, we focus entirely on recent work that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate personalized text, images, audio, or other modalities. We consider techniques for personalization that elicit and incorporate user preferences when generating multimodal outputs. To study these techniques, we decompose works across the following three dimensions: the modality of the content being generated (e.g., text, images, audio, or other); the personalization technique being employed (e.g., prompt-based, prefix tuning, finetuning/adapters); the application of the personalized MLLM (e.g., chat/assistant, recommendation systems, retrieval, classification, image generation, text generation)."

            "content": "Personalization in multimodal large language models presents several significant challenges, due to the complexity of combining diverse types of data, extracting relevant information, and delivering userspecific insights. To tackle these challenges, researchers have introduced techniques such as multimodal instruction, alignment, and generation. Multimodal large language models need to combine information from various modalities, such as text, images, audio, video, and user engagement (Wei et al., 2024a; Xu et al., 2024). Each modality has distinct characteristics and may convey different types of information. For example, text might describe product, while an image conveys its visual appearance. Integrating these heterogeneous data types is challenging because they require different encoding methods, processing pipelines, and alignment strategies. Misalignment or incomplete fusion (Lyu et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2023) can lead to inconsistent or inaccurate user preferences being captured, thus reducing the effectiveness of personalized recommendations. Multimodal alignment can help resolve inconsistencies that may arise from mismatched modalities."

            "content": "Different modalities often include noisy, redundant, or irrelevant information (Liu et al., 2024c; Lyu and Luo, 2022). For example, images of the same product in e-commerce platforms may have varying quality or redundant features, while textual descriptions might include unnecessary details. Extracting meaningful insights from such noisy data is challenging because the model needs to filter out irrelevant content without losing important context. This process becomes even more difficult when handling large amounts of data, as the noise accumulates and complicates the extraction of relevant user preferences. Multimodal instruction can help filter out noisy or redundant data by guiding the model to focus on the most relevant modalities and inputs for each user. By directing the models attention to key features in user interactions, this method reduces the impact of irrelevant or repetitive information, ensuring that the generated outputs are more meaningful and concise."

However, visual inputs often contain nuancessuch as color, texture, and contextthat are difficult to capture with language alone (Shen et al., 2024). For instance, subtle preferences in fashion, home decor, or art may be driven by visual factors that are abstract or subjective. Multimodal LLMs may struggle to extract these fine-grained visual details and relate them meaningfully to textual descriptions, leading to loss of personalization depth. Multimodal alignment facilitates mre granular understanding by ensuring that the relationships between different modalities are preserved."

To better express preferences for novel items, the user can provide the reference image as part of the recommendation instruction (Zhou et al., 2023). Based on the users interaction with visual items, the multimodal recommender system could analyze user preferences and intentions (Ye et al., 2024b; Yu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024c). PMG (Shen et al., 2024) further transform multimodal user behaviors into language to model user preferences for recommendation task. For items in recommendation tasks, when meta data of item is lacking, MLLMs are beneficial to extract rich descriptive information of items for better recommendation (Zhou et al., 2023; Lyu et al., 2024b). On the other hand, many works also encode visual information with textual information into latent representations for better item modeling (Tian et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024a). In addition, multimodal instructions enable interactions through screenshots (Karra and Tulabandhula, 2024), personalized item design (Wei et al., 2024a), and conversational recommendations based on reference images (Zhou et al., 2023)."

On the other hand, other works consider using MLLMs abilities in encoding multimodal representations, to enable itemlevel augmentation (Tian et al., 2024), user-item fusion (Xu et al., 2024), and across-task multimodal knowledge transferring (Hu et al., 2024). Recent developments in end-to-end multimodal learning, where multimodal instructions input as sequence, enables novel paradigm of generative recommendation, which regards recommends as next-token prediction task. Some preliminary works directly prompt advanced MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4V) to understand the multimodal instruction and recommendations based on reasoning. Liu et al.

Such multimodal generation provides better explanability of the recommended items and better convinces users to accept the items.

Several models focus on personalized recommendation tasks, as detailed in Section 5 (Karra and Tulabandhula, 2024; Wei et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024b). In the recommendation setting, the goal is to rank the true target (e.g., item or movie) highest on the list relative to other items. Commonly used metrics for this task include MRR, Recall@k, Hit@k, AUC, HR@k, and NDCG@k, which evaluate how well the model ranks the true target item in comparison to other options. Personalized multimodal generation focuses on creating customized content, such as images or text, by considering user-specific behavior. This includes generating personalized images, posters for movies, or emojis, as demonstrated by Shen et al. (2024). Shen et al. (2024) utilize various image similarity techniques to evaluate the similarity between the generated content and historical or target items, employing metrics like LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) (Zhang et al., 2018) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) (Wang et al., 2004). Additionally, this area encompasses personalized chatbots (Nguyen et al., 2024; Fei et al., 2024; Abuzuraiq and Pasquier, 2024), which assess models abilities to recognize personalized subjects in images, handle visual and text-based question answering (Alaluf et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024), and evaluate emotional intelligence by measuring emotion detection accuracy and response diversity (Fei et al., 2024). Gal et al. (2022) introduce personalized text-toimage generation, synthesizing novel scenes based on user-provided concepts and natural language instructions. They evaluate the model by calculating the average pair-wise CLIP-space cosine similarity between generated images and the conceptspecific training set, as well as the editability of prompts by measuring the similarity between the generated images and their textual descriptions using CLIP embeddings. Other methods in this domain (Kim et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024) focus on two main aspects: identity preservation, which assesses the models ability to maintain the subjects identity, and prompt fidelity, which ensures alignment between the generated images and the textual prompts. Identity preservation is typically measured by I-CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and I-DINO (Caron et al., 2021), which compute subject similarity using CLIP and DINO as backbones. Prompt fidelity is evaluated through the CLIP-based text-image similarity score (T-CLIP). Image diversity is assessed using the Inception Score (IS) to capture the variation within generated sets. Jang et al. (2024) introduce new metric, Detect-and-Compare (D&C), to evaluate multisubject fidelity, addressing the limitations of existing metrics (like I-CLIP or DINOv2) that do not to prevent identity mixing in multi-subject scenarios. Wang et al. (2024d) and others (Ma et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a) focus on multi-subject personalized text-to-image generation, using M-DINO to capture subject fidelity by avoiding subject neglect, which average fidelity metrics may overlook. Other tasks include personalized image retrieval, where the Vision-Language model is expected to retrieve collection of relevant images based on textual query, using personalized context previously provided by the user (either in the form of images or text). Cohen et al. (2022) first introduce the concept of Personalized Vision and Language, along with benchmark to evaluate models on tasks like personalized image retrieval and personalized image segmentation. ConCon-Chi (Rosasco et al., 2024) further extend this by proposing new benchmark that evaluates models ability to learn new meanings and their compositionality with known concepts. The setting of personalized retrieval has also been expanded to videos in the works of (kor, 2022; Yeh et al., 2023b). Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) evaluates the models capability to retrieve images based on compositional queries, without requiring prior examples for new combinations of known concepts. The metrics typically used for these tasks include measuring the rank of the first ground truth (GT) image using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Recall@k to determine if any GT image appears in the top-k results, and Mean Average Precision (MAP) to assess the ranking of all GT images. Additionally, MAP@k evaluates the precision of GT images up to the topk retrieved results. Lastly, personalized semantic segmentation focuses on segmenting an instance of personalized concept in an image, based on textual query that refers to that concept. Cohen et al. (2022) use the intersection-over-union (IoU) metric to evaluate this, reporting the rate of predictions with IoU above specified threshold."

These datasets span various domains, including vision-language models, agent collaboration networks, fashion retrieval, and crossmodal retrieval tasks. For instance, ConConChi (Rosasco et al., 2024) and MSMTPInfo (Shi et al., 2024b) provide benchmarks for evaluating complex, dynamic user interactions in multimodal contexts, while fashion-focused datasets such as FashionIQ (Wu et al., 2021), and Fashion200k (Han et al., 2017) offer rich collections of images and triplets for advancing research in fashion retrieval and recommendation. UniMP (Wei et al., 2024b) uses Amazon review data including the user-item interactions and the items images. Other datasets like RefCOCOg (Mao et al., 2016) and CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) focus on relationships between objects and regions in images, contributing to cross-modal retrieval research. In addition, wide range of datasets in multimodal recommendation and information retrieval are used in developing and evaluating personalized MLLMs. We summarize series of comprehensive datasets with detailed descriptions in Table 2 (Appendix A)."

Since these models are typically pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, they become highly proficient at processing and interpreting textual information. Consequently, when integrating multiple modalities, there is tendency for the model to over-rely on text, which can overshadow other crucial data sources like images or audio. This text bias often results in suboptimal performance in tasks that require deeper understanding of non-textual information, where visual or audio cues are key to provide the full context."

            "content": "To tackle these diverse challenges, researchers employ wide array of approaches, ranging from the use of established, large-scale public datasets to the creation of tailored datasets for specific tasks. For example, studies on multimodal sequential recommendation often leverage datasets like AmazonBaby (McAuley et al., 2015), Amazon-Game (He and McAuley, 2016), and MicroLens (Ni et al., 2023) for evaluation. In contrast, some researchers Dataset Name Description Stats ConCon-Chi (Rosasco et al., 2024) Benchmark for personalized vision-language tasks 4008 images; 20 concepts; 101 contexts MSMTPInfo (Shi et al., 2024b) Evaluation for Agent Collaboration Network 13 themes; multiple sessions; dynamic user topics Shoes (Berg et al., 2010) Dataset for interactive fashion image retrieval 8900 training triplets; 1700 test triplets Fashion200k (Han et al., 2017) Large-scale fashion dataset with over 200K images 172K training images; 33K test queries Business Dataset (Deng et al., 2009) User query images from real image search engine 50K images; 5 suggestions per image YoLLaVA (Nguyen et al., 2024) Personalized language and vision assistant dataset 40 subjects; 10-20 images per subject RefCOCOg (Mao et al., 2016) Images from MS-COCO with relational annotations 21899 train, 1300 val and 2600 test images Flickr30K (Young et al., 2014) Benchmark for visual-semantic embedding networks 29000 train, 1000 validation and 1000 test images MicroLens (Ni et al., 2023) Video introductions and cover images 1 billion user-item interactions; 34 million users Amazon-Baby (McAuley et al., 2015) Images and product descriptions 180 million relationships; 6 million objects; interaRec (Karra and Tulabandhula, 2024) Screenshot based recommendations using multimodal large language models 1,500 sessions; item IDs; screenshots of webpages POG (Chen et al., 2019) Fashion rec by personalized outfit generation 1.43 million outfits; 80 most frequent categories; MovieLens (Ni et al., 2023) Describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity 100K ratings; 3,683 tag applications; 9,742 movies Table 2: Summary of Datasets. B.3 Personalized MLLM Text Generation Wei et al. (2024a) propose multimodal learning framework where vision model extracts features from images and language model learns from texts. The extracted features are jointly modeled to yield personalized product recommendation, preference prediction, explanation generation. Additionally, Wang et al. (2024c) leverage multimodal learning to answer science-related questions using chain-of-thought reasoning. B.4 Personalized MLLM Image Generation Shen et al. (2024) utilize MLLMs to generate movie posters tailored to users preferences. Similarly, Song et al. (2024) and Wei et al. (2024c) leverage LLMs to generate images based on visual and textual prompts. B.5 Miscellaneous Applications MLLMs have been applied in various other fields, such as helping visually impaired individuals by verifying images and offering outfit suggestions (Xie et al., 2024). Moreover, MLLMs are used on brain tumor segmentation and tumor identification (Dai et al., 2024). harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data, as exemplified by the Business Dataset (Deng et al., 2009), which utilizes GPT-generated suggestions for labeling. The development of custom datasets also plays crucial role, as seen in POGs (Chen et al., 2019) adaptation of the iFashion dataset for personalized fashion recommendations, InteraRecs (Karra and Tulabandhula, 2024) collection of screenshots from Amazon websites to create new resource for multimodal recommendation research, and LongLaMP (Kumar et al., 2024) benchmark to evaluate long-form personalized text generation. summary of these datasets can be found in Table 2."
