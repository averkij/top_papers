            "content": "Images acquired in the wild exhibit mixed, unknown degradationssensor noise, motion blur, lens aberrations, compression artifactsthat erode perceptual fidelity and induce semantic drift in recognition and analysis. Universal image restoration (UIR) seeks to reconstruct images with high perceptual fidelity while preserving semantic consistency under such uncertainty and without access to degradation labels or side information. Despite steady progress, this combination of unknown mixtures, realism, and semantic preservation remains stubbornly challenging. Discriminative restorers based on CNNs and Transformers Dong et al. (2016); Liang et al. (2021); Zamir et al. (2022) perform well on synthetic distortions but falter on in-the-wild mixtures, often oversmoothing textures or leaving visible artifacts. This gap has motivated generative approaches that leverage diffusion-based text-to-image priors to synthesize plausible structure and detail beyond the reach of purely discriminative models Yu et al. (2024); Ai et al. (2024); Wu et al. (2024b); Wang et al. (2024a;b); Yue et al. (2023); Wu et al. (2024a); Lin et al. (2025). Yet most such systems rely on Stable Diffusion (SD) UNet backbones Rombach et al. (2022): their capacity and inductive bias saturate under complex degradations, making it difficult to recover fine detail while maintaining global structuresuggesting the need to look beyond UNet-based designs. Recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) open promising avenue. In contrast to UNet architectures, DiTs employ attention-centric backbones that more effectively couple global context with local detail and carry richer generative priors. For instance, DreamClear Ai et al. (2024) builds on PixArt-Î± Chen et al. (2023), relatively small (0.6B) DiT, illustrating the promise of transformer backbones for restoration. However, their limited scale constrains robustness to mixed, real-world degradations and impedes the concurrent recovery of global structure and fine detail. Large-scale diffusion transformers such as Flux.1 Labs (2024) deliver strong modeling capacity for universal restoration, yet direct transfer rarely works off-the-shelf. Previous ControlNet-style conditioning methods Yu et al. (2024); Ai et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2023) disrupt the parameterstructure balance and underutilize the backbones temporal and hierarchical division of labor. Unconstrained injection of degraded observations amplifies artifacts; relying on VLM-generated captions further increases latency and risks semantic drift0. Meanwhile, backbones at this scale are decisively 0Appendix Sec. A.1 quantifies the prevalence of degradation-related terms in MLLM captions, and Appendix Fig. 5 demonstrates how such bias can misguide restoration. Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab data-limited: gains follow datacompute scaling only when trained on curated, large-scale, highquality sets. Public web corpora fall short for UIRthey skew toward aesthetic, compression-heavy images, contain substantial near-duplicates and low-information frames, and rarely cover the longtail mixtures of real degradations or provide usable pairs. Without rigorous filtering and structureaware selection, large DiTs underutilize capacity and overfit spurious artifacts, underscoring the need for an explicit curation pipeline. Taken together, these tensions point to more structured path, one that schedules conditioning across timesteps and layers, couples robust input handling with caption-free inference, and remains practical to assemble on available datasets. To operationalize this path, we introduce LucidFlux, caption-free UIR framework that adapts the large-scale Flux.1 diffusion transformer to restoration. The core of our LucidFlux is lightweight dual-branch conditionera two-block transformer module that injects signals from the degraded input without inflating the parameters. One branch ingests the low-quality image to anchor the geometry and layout, while the other consumes lightly restored proxy to suppress hard artifacts; their outputs are scheduled through timestepand layer-adaptive modulation that aligns guidance with the backbones hierarchical roles, yielding coarse-to-fine, context-aware updates that preserve texture while protecting global structure. To avoid the latency and drift introduced by text prompts, we enforce semantic consistency via caption-free alignment with SigLIP, extracting semantic cues directly from the proxy. We pair the model with an automated three-stage curation pipelineblur detection, flat-region filtering, and perceptual quality scoringto assemble diverse training sets at the billion-parameter scale. Our contributions are as follows: LucidFlux framework. We adapt large diffusion transformer (Flux.1) to UIR with lightweight dual-branch conditioner and timestepand layer-adaptive modulation, aligning conditioning with the backbones hierarchical roles while keeping less trainable parameters.

            "content": "Generative Priors for UIR. Large-scale pretrained generative models, particularly text-to-image diffusion transformers Rombach et al. (2022); Podell et al. (2023), have shown strong capability in synthesizing high-fidelity textures and structures for image restoration. Existing approaches build on different backbones, with SUPIR Yu et al. (2024) using SDXL, DreamClear Ai et al. (2024) relying on PixArt-Î± Chen et al. (2023), StableSR on SD, SeeSR on SD2, and Resshift Yue et al. (2023) and SinSR Wang et al. (2024b) trained from scratch. While these methods perform well on their respective backbones, they struggle to scale as text-to-image models continue to grow in size, limiting both their performance and expressive capacity. Addressing these challenges, we propose LucidFlux, universal image restoration framework built on the large-scale Flux.1 backbone, which leverages richer generative priors and greater expressive capacity. Semantic Alignment. Preserving semantic fidelity during image restoration remains significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on generating captions from degraded images using visionlanguage models at inference time Yu et al. (2024); Ai et al. (2024); Kong et al. (2025), which introduces additional computational cost and may produce inconsistencies between training and inference. Alternative strategies employ coarse textual cues Wu et al. (2024b;a), but such signals are generally insufficient to capture fine-grained semantic content. In contrast, LucidFlux leverages SigLIP-based semantic alignment module that extracts rich semantic representations directly from lightly restored images, facilitating caption-free guidance and ensuring that restored outputs maintain high semantic consistency without hallucinations. 3 Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab"

            "content": "Figure 2: Overview of the proposed architecture for universal image restoration. Our method integrates dual condition streams (LQ and LRP) with timestepand layer-adaptive modulation modules, and incorporates SigLIP semantic priors through connector into Flux-based DiT backbone to jointly enhance perceptual quality and semantic consistency. Our framework is built upon Flux-based DiT backbone, augmented with two parallel ControlNet branches. The first branch processes the original low-quality image (LQ), while the second branch takes lightly restored version of the input (LRP) generated by lightweight restoration model. Both streams capture complementary information, which is subsequently modulated through timestepand layer-adaptive modules to align with the DiT feature space. Moreover, we incorporate semantic priors extracted from SigLIP and enhanced with connector, which are injected into the DiT layers to facilitate semantic consistency and fine-grained texture restoration. Practically, we eschew inference-time captions: Appendix Sec. A.1 quantifies that 1724% of MLLM captions introduce degradation-related terms, and Appendix Fig. 5 shows such bias misguides restoration, degrading perceptual quality. 3.1 LIGHTWEIGHT DUAL-BRANCH CONDITIONER Directly conditioning on the low-quality (LQ) image preserves high-frequency details but often leaks residual artifacts under mixed degradations; conditioning on lightly restored proxy (LRP) suppresses artifacts but tends to oversmooth textures. Following the dual-branch paradigm proposed in Ai et al. (2024), we therefore decouple structure anchoring and artifact suppression into two signals and encode them with minimal-overhead conditioner that interfaces with the Flux.1 DiT backbone without duplicating large blocks. As illustrated in the top-right of Fig. 2, only the core conditioning pathway is shown for clarity, while other components such as timestep embeddings remain consistent with Flux. Throughout, the Flux.1 backbone and VAE remain frozen for stability and efficiency. The output feature map ILRP of the LRP is computed by: ILRP = LRP(ILQ). (1) Both ILQ and ILRP are mapped by the shared Flux.1 VAE encoder into latents zLRP = E(ILRP), where is the VAE downsampling factor and the latent width. The Dual-Branch Conditioner (DBC) then converts each latent into compact conditioning tokens via two-block MMDiT applied zLQ = E(ILQ), (2) H d, 4 Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab at latent resolution, ÏLQ = DBC(zLQ), ÏLRP = DBC(zLRP), (3) where DBC patchifies the VAE latent and projects patches into 2D-positioned sequence before two stacked transformer blocks; weights are not shared across branches, as the LQ stream emphasizes detail-preserving, noise-tolerant cues while the LRP stream favors structure-first, artifact-suppressed representations. Using separate parameters avoids competing gradients and preserves branch complementarity, while the conditioner remains minimal (two blocks per branch, constant overhead w.r.t. layer depth and far smaller than ControlNet-style duplication of large DiT). Intuitively, ÏLQ carries detail-preserving yet noisy cues, whereas ÏLRP provides artifact-robust structure; the subsequent timestepand layer-adaptive condition modulation (Sec. 3.2) consumes these two complementary signals for coarse-to-fine, context-aware guidance without increasing the conditioners footprint."

            "title": "3.2 TIMESTEP- AND LAYER-ADAPTIVE CONDITION MODULATION",
            "content": "Diffusion transformers exhibit temporalhierarchical division of labor: early timesteps reconstruct coarse structures while later ones refine high-frequency details; similarly, shallower layers capture low-level edges and deeper layers process semantics Park et al. (2023); Qian et al. (2024). Applying identical conditioning across all timesteps and layers risks redundancy or conflict. We therefore modulate the outputs of the dual-branch conditioner (DBC) in way that is adaptive to both timestep and layer index while keeping the heavy Flux.1 backbone frozen. Let ÏLQ and ÏLRP denote the features produced by DBC from the low-quality input (LQ) and the lightly restored proxy (LRP). lightweight modulation head takes sinusoidally encoded (t/T, l/L) and predicts feature-wise (per-channel) scale and bias for each branch independently: , Î²t,l Î±t,l = Modulation (cid:0)PE(t/T, l/L)(cid:1), {LQ, LRP}, Î±t,l , Î²t,l Rdc. These parameters effect an AdaptiveLN-style adjustment, Ït,l LQ = Î±t,l LQ ÏLQ + Î²t,l LQ, Ït,l LRP = Î±t,l LRP ÏLRP + Î²t,l LRP, (4) (5) We then fuse the branches without additional normalization via feature-wise convex mixture: Î³t,l = Ï(cid:0)Gate(cid:0)PE(t/T, l/L)(cid:1)(cid:1), LQ + (cid:0)1 Î³t,l(cid:1) Ït,l Condt,l = Î³t,l Ït,l Î³t,l (0, 1)dc, LRP. (6) Predicting Î±/Î² per channel supplies sufficient flexibility to track the backbones roles across and without inflating capacity, and independent modulation for LQ vs. LRP preserves their complementary inductive biases (detail-preserving vs. artifact-robust). Keeping modulation inside the lightweight conditioner maintains negligible overhead while enabling coarse-to-fine, timestepand layer-aware guidance; ablations (Sec. 4.3) show that removing either the temporal or the hierarchical dependency degrades fidelity under mixed degradations. 3.3 SIGLIP FOR CAPTION-FREE SEMANTIC ALIGNMENT T2I diffusion models are typically conditioned on text, and many restoration methods adopt captions as semantic guidance Ai et al. (2024); Yu et al. (2024). During training, such captions are often derived from clean ground truth, yielding idealized supervision. At inference, however, only degraded inputs are available; captions generated from low-quality images tend to inherit degradation-specific artifacts and, when produced by large VLMs, add substantial latency and exacerbate traintest mismatch Sun et al. (2024). We replace caption generation with caption-free semantic pathway. Concretely, we extract image semantics from the lightly restored proxy ILRP using frozen SigLIP encoder and map them into the backbones textual embedding space via lightweight Connector: zs = Connector(cid:0)SigLIP(ILRP)(cid:1). The projected semantics zs are concatenated with small set of prompt tokens (default instruction) to form the multimodal context fed to the DiT backbone: (7) Context = Concat(zs, c). (8) 5 Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab Grounding semantics in ILRP stabilizes content under mixed degradations, while the Connector furnishes drop-in bridge to the text-conditioning interface, avoiding any duplication of heavy modules. This design eliminates external captions at both training and inference, reducing latency and removing major source of caption-induced semantic variance (e.g., differences across captioners or paraphrases). Grounding semantics in zs keeps outputs structurally faithful and semantically aligned to the input."

            "content": "Although large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are pretrained on hundreds of millions of imagetext pairs, they are not tailored for the universal image restoration task of our work. Training large diffusion transformers for UIR requires task-aligned data at scale with strong structure and perceptual quality. However, publicly available restoration corpora remain modest and/or lack reproducible quality control: DIV2K Agustsson & Timofte (2017a) (800/100), Flickr2K Agustsson & Timofte (2017b) (2,650), LSDIR Li et al. (2023) ( 85K with manual curation), and SUPIR Yu et al. (2024) (20M without disclosed filtering criteria), while DreamClear Ai et al. (2024) synthesizes 1M pairs at substantial computational cost. This leaves practical gap between what large DiTs need and what current datasets provide. To bridge this gap, we introduce, to our knowledge, the first publicly documented and extensively validated UIR-specific data filtering pipeline. It is fully automatic (parameters empirically set, pipeline automatic once fixed) and comprises three stagesblur screening, flat-region suppression, and perceptual-quality rankingexplicitly designed to retain structure-rich, high-quality images while discarding unsuitable samples. Data source. Our initial dataset is collected from two sources. First, we collect 2.3M images In addition, we incorporate 557K images from the Photo-Concept-Bucket from the Internet. dataset bghira (2023), yielding total of 2.9M candidate images. This combined pool serves as the raw data for subsequent filtering. Blur detection. Images that are heavily blurred or contain excessive high-frequency noise provide unreliable structural cues and are thus unsuitable for training. Following LSDIR Li et al. (2023), we quantify the degree of blur using the variance of the Laplacian Sblur(I) = Var(cid:0)2I(cid:1), where denotes an input image. Only images with 150 Sblur(I) 8000 Li et al. (2023) are retained, effectively excluding both overly blurred and noisy samples. These bounds are empirically hand-tuned based on preliminary experiments and careful visual audits on held-out subset to balance removal of extreme blur/noise while retaining legitimate shallow-depth-of-field and low-light scenes. (cid:17) (cid:16)(cid:112)(xI)2 + (yI) Flat-region detection. Images dominated by textureless regions may bias the model towards producing over-smoothed outputs. To mitigate this, each image is divided into non-overlapping 240 240 patches, and the edge richness of each patch is measured using the Sobel operator with Sflat = Var . Patches with Sflat < 800 are considered textureless, and images containing more than 50% such patches are discarded. Both the 800 patch-level threshold and the 50% image-level ratio are empirically set by manual inspection of edge-statistics distributions and visual audits; they provide conservative balance that suppresses large flat backgrounds yet preserves natural sky/water regions. This ensures that retained images exhibit sufficient edge and texture diversity, essential for high-fidelity restoration. After applying blur and flat-region filtering, 1.28M candidate images remain. IQA Filtering for High-quality Data. While LSDIR employs manual curation in its final stage, such human intervention is impractical for scaling to larger datasets. We apply CLIP-IQA to further ensure perceptual quality of our training data. The remaining images are ranked by their perceptual scores si, and only the top 20% are retained, i.e., {i si quantile0.8({si})}, resulting in 257K high-quality images. The 20% cutoff is empirically chosen after careful inspection at multiple percentiles (e.g., 10/20/30%), trading off perceptual quality against semantic/content diversity. By additionally incorporating 84K high-quality samples from LSDIR Li et al. (2023), the final curated dataset comprises 342K high-quality images. Once these cutoffs are fixed, the pipeline executes fully automatically at scale. For generating paired training data, degraded counterparts are synthesized using the Real-ESRGAN degradation pipeline Wang et al. (2021) as implemented in Ai et al. (2024), 6 Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab Figure 3: Comparison of dataset attributes. Our dataset exhibits higher CLIP-IQA scores, lower flatness, and more diverse resolutions than Flickr2K Agustsson & Timofte (2017b) and DIV2K Agustsson & Timofte (2017a). across 4 epochs, producing total of 1.36M image pairs. This procedure ensures both diversity and realism in the low-quality inputs, facilitating effective model training. To assess the effectiveness of our filtered data, we randomly select 10K samples and compare their attribute distributions with existing datasets. Figure 3 shows that our dataset achieves higher CLIP-IQA scores, comparable blur scores, lower flatness values that reflect richer textures, and more diverse resolutions than Flickr2K and DIV2K. In Appendix 6, we also analyze semantic diversity using t-SNE, and it shows that our dataset demonstrates substantially broader semantic coverage."

(2018). Together, these metrics provide comprehensive assessment of restoration performance across perceptual quality, semantic alignment, and structural fidelity. Qualitative Comparisons. Figure 4 presents visual comparisons on representative samples from RealLQ250. SeeSR and DreamClear reduce some degradations but tend to leave residual artifacts or produce oversmoothed outputs with limited texture recovery. SUPIR generates cleaner results yet often loses fine details, leading to overly smooth surfaces. In contrast, our method achieves clearer edges, richer textures, and better semantic consistency with the degraded inputs, especially in challenging regions such as hair, text, and high-frequency patterns. These qualitative observations align with the quantitative results in Table 1, further confirming the effectiveness of our approach. Quantitative Comparisons. Table 1 reports the IQA metric results on real-world and synthetic benchmarks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches on perceptual and semanticoriented metrics, such as CLIP-IQA+, MUSIQ, MANIQA, Q-Align, and NIMA, highlighting its ability to generate visually faithful and semantically aligned restorations. On real-world datasets (e.g., DRealSR, RealSR, RealLQ250), LucidFlux achieves clear gains over existing captionor tagbased methods. For distortion-focused measures like PSNR and SSIM on synthetic datasets, prior approaches report slightly higher values, yet these metrics are widely recognized as being less correlated with human perceptual quality. In contrast, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance on modern IQA benchmarks, supporting the view that advanced IR frameworks should be evaluated with perceptual and semantic quality measures rather than traditional distortion metrics. Runtime and Model Scale Comparison. We compare LucidFlux with SeeSR, SUPIR, and DreamClear in terms of runtime and model size in Table 3. Despite using substantially larger backbone (12B), our LucidFlux achieves competitive total runtime by eliminating the caption preprocessing. In contrast, SeeSR, SUPIR, and DreamClear require additional preprocessing and rely on smaller backbones (1.29B, 3.5B, 0.6B), resulting in higher latency relative to their size. For trainable 8 Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab Figure 4: Qualitative comparisons on RealLQ250. Baseline methods either leave noticeable artifacts or yield over-smoothed textures, while our approach restores sharper details. See Figure 8 to Figure 13 in Appendix for more visual comparisons. adapters, LucidFlux maintains balanced design (1.6B), outperforming SUPIR (1.3B) in representational capacity while remaining more efficient than DreamClear (2.2B). 4.3 ABLATION STUDY We ablate our three contributions in testing RealLQ250 and report the quantitative results in Table 4. Starting from the Dual-Branch Conditioner (DBC) trained on LSDIR, our CLIP-IQA / CLIP-IQA+ / MUSIQ scores are 0.585/0.609/61.582, and three scores are enlarged after adding caption-free SigLIP semantic alignment. Our timestepand layer-adaptive condition modulation (TLCM) further improves score performance, and scaling to our curated large-scale high-quality data provides the largest jump over TLCM on three metrics. The progression indicates that SigLIP alignment stabilizes semantics; TLCM exploits the DiT hierarchy; and data curation supplies structure-rich supervision, and thus all three modifications on DBC are required for the final outcome. 4.4 COMPARISON WITH CLOSE-SOURCE COMMERCIAL METHODS To assess the effectiveness of LucidFlux, we further compare it with several widely used commercial image restoration solutions, including HYPIR-FLUX Group (2025), Seedream 4.0 ByteDance Seed Vision Team (2025), Topaz Labs (2025), Gemini-NanoBanana DeepMind (2025), and MeiTu SR MeiTu (2025). All evaluations are conducted under the same experimental settings and the identical IQA metrics are used in the open-source comparisons. Table 2 reports the quantitative results of different methods. Our LucidFlux achieves the largest scores across all metrics and outperforms other commercial solutions. MeiTu SR shows the best performance among compared methods, but its restoration results generally have less details than our LucidFlux. In contrast, our method balances strong quantitative performance with reliable and consistent restoration, which makes it particularly suitable for real-world applications. See our Appendix Figure 7 for qualitative comparisons. 9 Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab Table 2: Quantitative comparison across different IQA metrics with commercial models on RealLQ250.

SigLIP-based semantics provide traininginference consistency without captions. To make post-training practical, we introduce, to our knowledge, the first publicly documented and extensively validated UIR data-filtering pipeline. It is fully automatic once hyper-parameters are fixed and scales to 342K high-quality images and 1.36M paired samples, supplying structure-rich supervision at the capacity needed by large DiTs.Across real and synthetic benchmarks, LucidFlux delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality and semantic fidelity with competitive runtime and minimal trainable overhead. We hope the pipeline, data recipe, and design insights provide reliable foundation for restoration in the wild, and inspire future work on learned data selection, multi-frame/video extensions, and higher-resolution backbonesall while retaining caption-free inference."

            "content": "When using captions from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as semantic guidance for restoration tasks, potential risk is that these models may unintentionally introduce degradationrelated terms (e.g., blur, noise, or low resolution). Such bias can mislead the restoration model by attributing degradations to input images even when they are not visually apparent. To quantify this effect, we evaluate the occurrence of degradation-related descriptions in captions generated by set of representative MLLMs on RealLQ250, specifically LLaVA-v1.6-Vicuna-13B Liu et al. (2024) and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct Team (2025). Each caption is produced using the same prompt as DreamClear Ai et al. (2024), i.e., describe the key subjects and style, which is designed to neutrally guide the model toward content description without explicitly emphasizing or suppressing degradation cues. We then employ Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image as an external evaluator to analyze whether captions contain degradation-related mentions. Each caption is processed with structured instruction to extract and categorize any degradation-related terms. Prompt A.1 (Identifying Quality Degradations in Image Captions) You are professional image quality analysis expert. Carefully analyze the following image description text and identify any image quality issues that are either explicitly mentioned or implicitly implied. Image description text: {caption content} Your task is to identify quality issues mentioned in the description. Focus on: Sharpness issues such as blur, unclear details, or defocus Noise, grain, or artifacts Low resolution, compression traces, or general quality problems Overexposure, underexposure, or color distortion Physical damage such as scratches, stains, or aging Return results strictly in the following JSON format, without any additional explanation or text: { } \"caption_content\": \"{caption_content}\", \"degradation_keywords\": [\"Extracted degradation-related terms\"] , \"degradation_categories\": { \"Blur-related\": [\"blur\", \"unclear\", \"defocus\"], \"Noise-related\": [\"noise\", \"grain\", \"artifacts\"], \"Quality-related\": [\"resolution\", \"compression\"], \"Exposure-related\": [\"overexposure\", \"underexposure\", \" color issues\"], \"Damage-related\": [\"damage\", \"stains\", \"aging\"] }, \"degradation_score\": 0.0, \"severity_level\": \"None/Minor/Moderate/Severe\", \"primary_issues\": [\"Main issue types\"], \"analysis_summary\": \"Brief analysis summary\" Scoring standard: degradation score: 0 means no degradation, < 0.3 minor, 0.30.6 moderate, > 0.6 severe If no quality issues are mentioned in the text, set all arrays empty, score = 0, severity level = None Important: Only return pure JSON format results, without markdown code blocks or extra commentary. If caption contains terms that explicitly refer to image degradations, such as blur, noise, low resolution, or compression artifacts, we consider it degradation-related caption. Table 5 presents the likelihood of captions containing such degradation-related terms. We observe that LLaVA-v1.6-vicuna13b produces degradation-related captions in 17% of cases, whereas Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits higher occurrence of 24%. This indicates that different MLLMs vary in their tendency to 14 Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab Table 5: Occurrence rates (%) of degradation-related terms in captions generated by different MLLMs on RealLQ250.

The fifth and sixth columns show that captions containing explicit degradation descriptions misguide the restoration model and result in inferior quality compared with captions focusing purely on content and style. introduce degradation cues into captions, which may potentially bias downstream restoration tasks if these captions are directly used as supervision. A.2 IMPACT OF DEGRADATION-RELATED CAPTIONS ON MODEL RESTORATION To further investigate the influence of degradation-related descriptions in MLLM-generated captions on restoration performance, we conducted experiments using two types of captions generated by LLaVA-v1.6-vicuna-13b. The first type uses the prompt Describe the key subjects and style to generate captions without emphasizing image degradations, while the second type uses the prompt Describe the key subjects and style, retain the descriptions of degradations on the image to produce captions that explicitly include degradation-related content. As shown in Figure 5, two patterns emerge from the qualitative results. First, captions generated by the same MLLM using the neutral prompt exhibit variability across multiple runs, resulting in differences in the restoration outputs for the same input image. Second, when captions explicitly include degradation-related descriptions, the models restoration performance is adversely affected, producing outputs of lower perceptual quality compared with captions that focus solely on key subjects and style. These findings indicate that both the consistency and content of MLLM-generated captions can significantly influence downstream restoration performance, underscoring the importance of controlling for degradation-related content when employing such captions as guidance. These observations further highlight the practical limitations of relying on MLLM-generated captions during inference. The variability in captions leads to inconsistent restoration results, the presence of degradation-related descriptions can mislead the model and reduce output quality, and generating captions introduces additional computational overhead. Together, these factors underscore the advantages of caption-free approach, which avoids reliance on potentially inconsistent or misleading textual guidance while reducing inference cost and maintaining robust restoration performance. 15 Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab A.3 ADDITIONAL RELATED WORKS Large-Scale Image Restoration Datasets. The availability of large, high-quality datasets is critical for training generative restoration models. Existing datasets exhibit notable limitations: LSDIR Li et al. (2023) provides 85K images but depends on manual filtering, SUPIR Yu et al. (2024) collects 20M images without disclosing quality control procedures, and DreamClear Ai et al. (2024) generates 1M images via SDXL fine-tuning at cost of 1280 V100 GPU days. To overcome these constraints, LucidFlux employs fully automated three-stage filtering pipeline integrating blur detection, flat-region detection, and perceptual quality assessment. This approach produces diverse, structurally rich datasets that are reproducible, scalable, and suitable for training billion-parameter diffusion backbones efficiently."

Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) introduces Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) with separate weights for image and text tokens and bidirectional information flow; it is trained with rectified flow and improved noise sampling biased toward perceptually relevant scales, yielding stronger text comprehension and typography Esser et al. (2024). PixArt-Î± proposes an efficient DiT recipethree-stage training (pixel dependency, textimage alignment, aesthetics), injecting cross-attention into DiT, and dense pseudo-captioningachieving 1024px photorealistic quality at fraction of typical compute Chen et al. (2023). FLUX Labs (2024) scales rectified-flow Transformer (rather than diffusion transformer), with open-weight variants (e.g., dev/schnell) built around cross-attention over text embeddings. Building on this line, LucidFlux leverages large MM-DiT backbone (Flux.1) and specializes conditioning for caption-free restoration, improving detail fidelity while preserving semantics. A.4 EXTENDED DATASET ANALYSIS To further examine semantic diversity, we visualize the CLIP imagetext embeddings using t-SNE. We randomly sample 10K images from our filtered data, while using all available images from Flickr2K and DIV2K. As shown in Figure 6, our dataset spans substantially broader semantic range, reflecting richer and more diverse imagetext concepts. This confirms the advantage of our dataset in supporting models that rely on wide semantic generalization. Figure 6: t-SNE visualization of CLIP imagetext embeddings. Our dataset covers broader semantic range than Flickr2K and DIV2K, indicating richer imagetext diversity. A.5 EXTENDED VISUAL COMPARISONS To provide more comprehensive evaluation, we present extended qualitative results across all benchmark datasets. Figures 813 include representative examples from RealLQ250, DRealSR, RealSR, DIV2K-Val, and LSDIR-Val. These comparisons consistently demonstrate that our method produces sharper edges, more faithful textures, and better preservation of semantic structures compared with existing open-source state-of-the-art approaches. The additional results further corroborate the advantages of our approach observed in the main paper. 16 Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab A.6 VISUAL COMPARISON WITH CLOSE-SOURCE COMMERCIAL METHODS Figure 7 illustrates representative visual results on RealLQ250. HYPIR-FLUX and Seedream 4.0 fail to fully remove degradations, leaving noticeable residual artifacts. Topaz suppresses degradations more effectively but generates flat and over-smoothed textures. Gemini-NanoBanana provides visually plausible outputs but often struggles to recover high-frequency details. MeiTu SR shows relatively strong restoration ability, producing sharper and more natural results compared with most commercial counterparts. Among the evaluated models, LucidFlux consistently delivers the sharpest structures and most faithful details, particularly in fine-grained regions, while maintaining high structural fidelity and reliability.

A.8 LIMITATIONS While LucidFlux attains strong perceptual quality and semantic fidelity, several practical limitations remain: Large model scale. LucidFlux is built on high-capacity DiT backbone (Flux.1). This provides rich generative priors but entails substantial parameter count and compute cost. Training generally requires multi-GPU setups; for inference, high-end GPUs are preferable to maintain reasonable throughput. Inference GPU memory. VRAM usage during inference is sizable and grows with input resolution and batch size. Transformer-based diffusion exhibits quadratic attention complexity with respect to token count, so higher resolutions can quickly amplify memory pressure. This constrains deployment on memory-limited devices unless tiling or resolution reductions are used. Sampling steps vs. quality. High-quality outputs typically require more than 15 denoising steps. Fewer steps may lead to over-smoothing and loss of fine textures. This introduces latencyquality trade-off that can be restrictive for real-time or interactive applications. Mitigations. Promising directions include model compression (distillation/pruning), low-precision inference, memory-efficient attention, and step reduction via progressive distillation. These optimizations are orthogonal to our method and could reduce compute and memory while preserving quality.

LucidFlux is designed for benign restoration of non-sensitive, natural photographic images with mixed, unknown degradations (e.g., sensor noise, motion blur, compression). Appropriate uses include consumer photo enhancement, archival preservation, academic research, and benchmarking under unknown degradations. The model aims to improve perceptual quality while preserving semantics, but as generative diffusion system it may synthesize plausible details not present in the input. Out-of-scope scenarios. The method is not intended for domains that require pixel-accurate fidelity or expert supervision (e.g., medical imaging, scientific microscopy, satellite/remote sensing, Technical Report - W2GenAI Lab or legally binding forensic evidence). It is also not tailored for document restoration or OCR-critical text recovery. Prohibited or discouraged uses. LucidFlux should not be used to circumvent privacy, safety, or consentsuch as deblurring or enhancing faces, license plates, or personally identifiable content for surveillance or re-identification; removing watermarks or intentional obfuscation; fabricating or altering imagery for deception; or generating identity-sensitive content (e.g., deepfakes). When restoration might affect downstream decisions about people, human oversight is required. Operational caveats. Because performance depends on degradation type and sampling steps, outputs should be reviewed before downstream use, especially in safety-critical or regulatory contexts. If exact visual truth is required, classical reconstruction baselines or domain-specific methods with uncertainty quantification are preferable.
