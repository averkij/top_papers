            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Recently, significant progress has been made in aligning vision-language models (VLMs) (Hurst et al., 2024) with humans through visual instruction tuning (Liu et al., 2024b), visual preference optimization (Sun et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023), and safety alignment (Zong et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024c). These studies focus on general alignment goals, e.g., following human instructions, reducing visual hallucinations, and aligning with human values. Based on the success of these techniques, * Corresponding authors. Figure 1: Individuals with different Role-Sets exhibit personalized situated cognition when encountering the same broken swing visual scene, resulting in personalized expectations for the VLM assistants responses. VLMs have become essential assistants for humans in managing visual tasks (Yin et al., 2023). However, even in the same situation, people with diversified backgrounds might have personalized situated cognition 1. Consequently, they may have personalized expectations for the VLM assistants responses. To illustrate this, we present broken swing visual scene as an example in Figure 1. When faced with the broken swing scenario, child may feel unsure and worried due to their limIn this conited ability to address such issues. text, the VLM assistant is expected to offer reassurance and basic safety guidance, ensuring that the child understands not to play on the swing for their safety and easing their concerns. In contrast, repairman possesses the expertise to fix the problem. Therefore, the VLM assistant should provide professional advice on repairing the swing, enabling 1Referencing the Situated Cognition Theory (Brown et al., 1989), we define the situated cognition discussed in this paper as: 1) cognition of the visual scene state; 2) cognition of body and mind states; 3) cognition of the appropriate next action. the repairman to take appropriate actions. ity of PCogAlign compared to baselines. The personalized situated cognition and personalized expectation reveal that current VLM assistants, which provide one-size-fits-all response, are inadequate. Therefore, advancing research to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition is crucial. This will enable them to be more effective collaborators, capable of meeting personalized expectations from diverse individuals. To study this problem, we first need to consider how to define diverse individuals. Given that human diversity stems from numerous factors, such as age and socioeconomic status, which are almost impossible to operationalize in experiments, we have to make necessary simplifications. Based on the concept of the Role-Set from Role Theory (Goffman, 1959), we characterize each individual as set of Role@Location components, such as Child@Home, Member@Community as illustrated in Figure 1. Individuals with different Role-Sets exhibit personalized situated cognitions and therefore expect personalized responses. Based on the above definition, we construct benchmark named PCogAlignBench to investigate how to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition. Specifically, we select 8 social locations (Oldenburg, 1989) where individuals might engage and define 3 to 5 roles for each location (32 roles in total). Based on certain combination constraints, we define 20 Role-Sets, each of which consists of 5 Role@Location combinations. Then, we automatically collect 12k training samples and 6k test samples. The test samples undergo rigorous quality control through human annotators to ensure evaluation reliability. Each sample includes RoleSet, an image, and query posed by the individual. Additionally, every test sample includes an oracle guidance, which describes the characteristics of the expected personalized response. Furthermore, we propose framework named PCogAlign for this problem, which consists of three steps. 1) Estimating the individuals situated cognition and optimal action. 2) Sampling multiple personalized responses via cooperative agents. 3) Constructing and utilizing cognition-aware and action-based reward model to iteratively select the optimal response. The selected optimal responses are expected to align well with individuals personalized situated cognition and assist individuals in making optimal actions, and will be used as feedback for alignment training. Experimental results in various settings consistently prove the superiorIn all, our study makes three main contributions. 1) Novel Task. We introduce novel task that aims to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition to meet diverse expectations. 2) New Benchmark. We present new benchmark named PCogAlignBench to explore this novel task, which consists of 18k samples. 3) Novel Methodology. We propose novel framework named PCogAlign as baseline for this task. Comprehensive experimental results and analysis validate its effectiveness."

            "content": "Alignment of Vision-Language Models Existing techniques for aligning vision-language models (VLMs) with humans can be categorized into three types based on their alignment objectives: 1) visual instruction tuning (Liu et al., 2024b,a) to enable VLMs to follow human instructions in visual tasks; 2) visual preference optimization to mitigate visual hallucinations in VLMs responses (Sun et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024a; Xing et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024a,b); and 3) safety fine-tuning to align VLMs with human values and prevent harmful outputs (Chen et al., 2024b; Shi et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024c). The success of these alignment techniques has enabled VLMs to be effective assistants for humans in tasks involving visual scenes (Yin et al., 2024). However, considering the diversity of individuals cognition, even in the same visual context, their expectations for VLM assistants may vary widely. Existing general alignment objectives struggle to meet such wide range of needs. Our research aims to bridge this gap by exploring how to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition. Personalized Alignment of AI Models There are two main orientations (Wang et al., 2024e) of AI models personalized alignment (Kirk et al., 2024a,b; Zhang et al., 2024d; Sorensen et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c; Wu et al., 2024a): 1) Personal Reflection, where AI imitates human personalities for AI-based social simulation (Mou et al., 2024a,b; Zhou et al., 2023) or social agents (Feng et al., 2024; Agrawal et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2023); 2) Personal Assistant, which tailors AI to be the ideal assistant for humans with specific personalities, including personalized recommendations (Wei et al., 2024), retrieval (Pi et al., 2024; Shen et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024), or personalized image (Li et al., 2024b; Shi et al., 2024a) or text generation (Li et al., 2024a) assistance. Our work falls within the scope of the latter. The most relevant studies to our work are recent research on personalized Large Language Model (LLM) assistants (Jang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024b; Sun et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024d). However, these studies: 1) do not involve visual contexts; 2) mainly focus on certain combinations of personalized text styles or values (Chen et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024f; Zhang et al., 2024b,a; Cheng et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2024), which are unable to model human diversity. Our research seeks to address these issues through: 1) modeling human diversity using the sociological concept of Role-Set; and 2) investigating personalized alignment of VLM assistants in visual scene tasks."

            "content": "To clarify the proposed task, this section provides: 1) problem simplifications, 2) the notations, and 3) the optimization objective of this task. Problem Simplification The proposed task aims to explore how to align VLM assistants with the personalized situated cognitions of diverse individuals. However, there are two main challenges when exploring this problem: 1) How to define diverse individuals? 2) How to evaluate whether the personalized alignment is achieved? For the first question, we introduce Role-Set to characterize individuals diversity. In Role Theory (Goffman, 1959), Role-Set is the collection of various roles connected to specific social positions, influencing an individuals behavior and expectations. The roles within an individuals RoleSet reflect the combination of their social positions, which may lead to diverse situated cognitions and personalized expectations for VLM assistants responses. In this study, each individuals Role-Set is set to contain 5 Role@Location components. For the second question, we believe that personalized alignment should enable the VLM assistant to generate personalized responses that effectively guide individuals toward taking better actions. As emphasized in Gallagher (2006), both the human body and mind are critical to human action. Thus, we conceptualize action here as the combination of external Body Behavior and internal Mind Feelings. For example, in Figure 1, personalized response should help the child move away from the broken swing and reduce feelings of worry. Notations Consider sample = (RS, v, q), where RS denotes the Role-Set of the individual, represents the visual scene (image) encountered by the individual, denotes the query posed by the individual. The VLM assistant, parameterized by θ, is represented as fθ. For given sample s, the response generated by the VLM assistant is = fθ(s). The individual with the Role-Set RS who encounters the visual scene has the situated cognition = C(s). Subsequently, based on the individuals situated cognition and the received VLM response r, the probability that the individual takes the action is denoted as PA(ar, c). Optimization Objective According to the problem simplification, when the VLM response is wellaligned with the individuals personalized situated cognition, the individual is most likely to take the desired optimal action. Thus, based on the above notations, we define the optimization objective as: θ = arg max θ EsStrainPA(ar = fθ(s), c), (1) where Strain is the training set, = C(s), and = (RS, v, q). The objective is to find the optimal parameters θ for the VLM assistant that maximizes the expected probability of the individuals action being the desired action a."

Benchmark Overview The proposed benchmark consists of 12k training samples and 6k test samples. We define 20 individuals with different RoleSets in total. Each training sample consists of an individuals Role-Set, an image, and query proposed by the individual. To ensure the evaluation is reliable, we further gather oracle guidance for each test sample, which describes the characteristics of the expected personalized response. Besides, considering that the proposed benchmark cannot cover all possible Role-Sets, we need to ensure settings where the Role-Sets encountered during the training and test phases do not overlap. To achieve this, we divide the defined 20 Role-Sets into two subsets, LS1 and LS2, according to the different social location sets considered, as shown in Figure 2 (a). Such division allows us to test the models generalization ability to unseen Role-Sets, e.g., training on LS1 and testing on LS2. Figure 2: Overview of the collection process of PCogAlignBench. The LS1 subset considers roles in {Home, Community, Museum, Airport, Store}. The LS2 subset considers roles in {Home, Community, School, Hospital, Restaurant}. Here we take the Individual I1 in LS1 as an example to illustrate the process of image collection."

            "content": "Figure 2 illustrates the construction of PCogAlignBench, consisting of three steps, i.e., Role-Set collection, image collection, and query collection. Role-Set Collection We refer to Oldenburg (1989) and select eight social locations where individuals might participate, including Home, Community, Museum, Airport, Store, School, Hospital, Restaurant. Then, we define 3 to 5 roles for each location (32 roles in total), e.g., Student, Teacher, Librarian in the School. Finally, based on certain constraints 2, we construct 20 different Role-Sets via combinations, 10 per subset as in Figure 2 (a). Image Collection To ensure the diversity and reliability of collected images via search engines, we need to first collect diverse and detailed visual scene descriptions as search terms. To achieve this, we design hierarchical collection strategy as shown in Figure 2 (b). Specifically, the collection process consists of four coarse-to-fine levels, beginning with the individuals Role-Set at Level 1. At Level 2, we collect various visual scene types that individuals might observe in the social locations associated with their Role-Sets. However, we find that it is quite difficult to generate diverse visual scene descriptions directly through the collected types. Thus, at Level 3, we include middle process, i.e., visual scene phrases collection, which can ensure diversity more 2For example, each individual can only have one permanent role. For more details, please refer to Appendix B.1. easily. Then, at Level 4, these collected visual scene phrases serve as seeds to guide the generation of detailed visual scene descriptions. Finally, we use these gathered visual scene descriptions as search terms in search engines to retrieve the desired images. Throughout this process, all generation is accomplished by providing instructions and demonstrations to GPT-4o. Please refer to Table 11 in the appendix for the prompt templates used for collecting visual scene types, visual scene phrases, and visual scene descriptions. Query Collection We further collect queries that individuals might pose to the VLM assistant in various image contexts. However, we find that GPT-4o may sometimes generate hallucinated queries that cannot be answered based on the information in the image. To address this, we first generate several candidate queries and then ask GPT-4o to select the best query according to predefined rules, e.g., the rule of avoiding queries that require real-time information, as illustrated in Figure 2 (c). Please refer to Table 12 in the appendix for prompt templates used for describing the collected images, generating candidate queries, and selecting the best query. Quality Control Considering that the process of image and query collection is automated through GPT-4o and search engines, its unavoidable that some noise data might be collected. To ensure the evaluation reliably reflects the models personalized alignment performance, we perform quality control on the test split by human annotators 3. Specifically, in the image collection, two human annotators revise about 30 duplicate or unclear visual scene types at level 2. At level 4 of image collection, we replace approximately 1,000 low-quality images with manually gathered ones collected by 10 trained annotators. For the query collection, one annotator carefully revises the queries that are observed to be unanswerable in experiments."

(2024) to ensure reliability. 1) We collect oracle guidance for each test sample through collaboration between GPT-4o and humans before evaluation, describing what kind of personalized response is expected by the individual. 2) We break down the scoring criteria into five dimensions, three reflecting personalized quality based on our problem definition and two reflecting general quality. In the evaluation process, we employ simulated interview method where the evaluator (GPT4o) acts as an interviewee with specific Role-Set. The oracle guidance is provided to the evaluator to score the VLM assistants responses based on the following five dimensions 4. 1) Role-Set Awareness (RSA): Advice tailored to roles. 2) Body Behavior Awareness (BBA): Strategies for users desired behavior and physical goals support. 3) Mind Feelings Awareness (MFA): Support for users emotional needs and desired mental states. 4) Contextual Awareness (CA): Relevance to the query and context. 5) Conversational Flow (CF): Interaction, natural flow, and balance between detail and clarity. Each scoring dimension ranges from integer 1 to 5. The average score across five dimensions is referred to as the personalization score (P. Score). Besides, we conduct human evaluation to ensure this automatic evaluation is reliable and consistent with humans, as shown in Figure 5."

            "content": "Since not all sampled responses align well with personalized situated cognition, we need to select the optimal one for alignment training. To facilitate this selection, we first construct cognition-aware and action-based reward model, as depicted in Figure 4. We then use this reward model for optimal response selection in Figure 3 (c). Reward Model Construction The reward model is key component in alignment techniques like RLHF (Bai et al., 2022), and is often trained using manually collected preference data. However, in personalized alignment, we cannot use such general preference data. Instead, we need to collect preference samples for each individual. To this end, we propose using negative RoleSets to collect preference data for reward model training as shown in Figure 4 (a). For example, for individual I1 (Teacher@School) and I2 (Student@School), VLMs responses for I2 are inappropriate for I1. Thus, the Role-Set of I2 can be treated as negative one for I1. Besides, since whether response meets personalized expectations is reflected in the individuals actions, we incorporate the individuals actions into the preference pair. The collected preference pairs are then used to train cognition-aware and action-based reward model, as shown in Figure 4 (b). Optimal Response Selection via Best-of-N We employ Best-of-N strategy to select the optimal response, as shown in Figure 3 (c). Specifically, Figure 5: Heatmaps showing the comparison between automatic and human evaluations on two subsets, LS1 and LS2. The automatic evaluation agrees with human assessment in 88% of cases (the sum of the diagonal elements), highlighting the reliability of the proposed automatic evaluation method. each personalized response is compared with the current optimal one. The optimal response is replaced with the new one if the reward model judges that the new one is better aligned with the personalized situated cognition and can guide the individual towards better action. Optimization The finally selected optimal response is used to optimize the VLM assistant fθ using the following supervised fine-tuning loss. θ = arg min θ EsStrain log (fθ(rs)), (2) where the obtained θ is also the solution to Eq. 1."

To ensure fair comparison, we empower all the DPO and SFT baselines with the estimated situated cognition and optimal action in Section 5.1 and generated Key Points in Section 5.2 5.

For the RS Prompt (S), we use the RS Prompt described above to generate personalized responses as the SFT targets. For Self-Refine (S), RLCD (S), and RLAIF (S), we adopt the chosen response in the DPO versions as the target for SFT.

The experiments show that our ablated version PCogAlign (D/S) achieves up to 5.7% improvement over RLAIF (D/S), indicating that our proposed cognition-aware and action-based reward model effectively empowers the optimal personalized response selection. Analysis on Detailed Dimensions Table 2 reports the results on the 5 dimensions described in Section 4.2, which is averaged by all settings in Table 1. We make the following observations. First, on dimensions focused on personalization, i.e., RSA, BBA, and MFA, our PCogAlign shows consistent improvements. This indicates that the VLM assistant obtained through PCogAlign can hit@1 hit@2 hit@ hit@1 hit@2 hit@3 w/o RM 28% 69% w/ RM 56% 94% 69% 99% 31% 79% 51% 93% 68% 98% Table 3: Human evaluation results (hit@k) of the selected responses without and with the constructed reward model (RM). The hit@k indicates if the response is within the top of the candidates. effectively recognize the users Role-Set (RSA), guide the user towards better body behavior (BBA), and enhance mind feelings (MFA). Second, our PCogAlign also brings improvements in the dimensions for general quality, i.e., CA and CF. This suggests that our method can improve the contextual awareness (CA) and conversational flow (CF) of the responses. Analysis on Constructed Reward Model To delve into the effectiveness of the constructed reward model in Section 5.3, we conduct human evaluation to examine the actual quality of the selected optimal response by the reward model. Specifically, we select 100 samples from the training processes on LS1 and LS2, respectively. Human evaluators are asked to rank the top 3 responses among the candidates for each sample (N = 6). Then, we calculate the hit@k metric of the selected response without and with the reward model. Note that without the reward model, we treat the first response generated during the personalized response sampling as the selected one. Method LS1LS1 LS1LS2 LS2LS LS2LS2 Average P. Score Win Rate P.

Besides, the constructed reward model brings 44.5% increase of hit@1, which further validates the importance of utilizing the constructed reward model for selecting the optimal personalized response. Evaluating Different VLMs on PCogAlignBench Our proposed PCogAlignBench can also serve as benchmark for evaluating the personalization adaptation ability of different VLMs. To this end, we have included several VLMs from additional series to benchmark their personalization adaptation abilities. We consider the prompt-based baselines and the prompt variant of our PCogAlign for this experiment. The results are shown in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the MiniCPM-V-2_6 shows the strongest personalization adaptation ability (average P. Score). Still, our PCogAlign (P) method consistently outperforms the baselines across all VLMs."

            "content": "In this paper, we highlight the importance of novel task, i.e., aligning vision-language model (VLM) assistants with personalized situated cognition. To explore this task, we construct new benchmark named PCogAlignBench, consisting of 18k samples. Furthermore, we present novel framework named PCogAlign as baseline for this problem, involving cognition-aware and actionbased reward model for alignment training. Experimental results and human evaluations validate the reliability of the proposed automatic evaluation method and the effectiveness of the PCogAlign."

            "content": "We summarize the potential limitations of our study as follows, which may inspire future research to further explore based on this work. 1) For the experimental feasibility, we introduce the Role-Set concept to simplify the problem when defining diverse individuals. However, in real life, an individuals diversity may extend beyond the Role-Set and can be influenced by various factors such as personality and background. Fully capturing such diversity while ensuring experimental feasibility is highly challenging issue, and we will continue to explore it in future work. 2) In the proposed PCogAlign framework, we employ prompt-based method to estimate the personalized situated cognition and optimal action. Although our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of this simple yet effective estimation method, we believe there may be better ways to accomplish this step. We encourage future research to explore this more deeply. 3) Experimentally, we notice that the effects brought by DPO-based variants are very weak. However, given the important role of preference optimization algorithms in general alignment, we may have not used the most suitable preference optimization algorithm for personalized alignment. We encourage future work to address this challenge theoretically and experimentally."

            "title": "Ethics Statement",
            "content": "During the data collection process, we made necessary designs in the role definition phase and quality control process to mitigate potential ethical risks. Specifically, in the role definition phase, we thoroughly discussed and defined roles that meet ethical standards to avoid factors like gender bias. For instance, to avoid gender bias, we defined that the responsibilities of mother@home\" and father@home\" are fairly distributed, including shared household chores, childcare, and handling family emergencies. Besides, in our human-led quality control process, we aimed to avoid potential ethical risks, including gender and racial biases etc. For example, if an annotator repeatedly encounters images showing women doing housework\" and relatively few men doing housework images, they are required to replace some of the women doing housework images with men doing housework. Thanks to the carefully designed role definitions, which consider avoiding potential bias, the automatically generated visual scene descriptions have largely avoided such biases, and we encountered less than 1% of such cases during the quality control process. Considering the vast number of potential role combinations (theoretically 6300 combinations in our setup), which significantly reduces the feasibility of conducting academic experiments, we selected subset of role combinations (20 Role-Sets) to form the Role-Sets in our dataset. This might raise concerns about certain biases. Although we believe this is acceptable in simulated research environment, in actual industry development, we encourage companies/developers to consider various user backgrounds to form comprehensive, unbiased Role-Sets for data collection and personalized alignment training. The diversity of the dataset encompasses two aspects: increasing the diversity of scenarios, and ensuring diversity to avoid potential biases, such as racial and gender biases. We obtained informed consent from all annotators about the statement of all human annotators being paid by the laboratory following local wage requirements before the manuscript submission."

Then, for each location, we define 3 to 5 roles as shown in Table 5. Specifically, the underlined roles are permanent roles, which occupy the majority of an individuals daily working time. Then, since we need to enable settings where the Role-Sets encountered during the training and test phases do not overlap, we divide the above locations into two subsets, LS1 and LS2, according to the different social location sets considered. The LS1 consists of {Home, Community, Museum, Airport, Store} and the LS2 consists of {Home, Community, School, Hospital, Restaurant}. Finally, we construct 10 Role-Sets for each subset via combinations based on the following predefined constraints. 1) Each individuals Role-Set can contain only one permanent role. 2) Each individuals Role-Set involves five roles. 3) Each permanent role can be adopted by only one individual. The collected Role-Sets are shown in Table 10. B."

We present the specific templates in Table 11. Besides, for collecting images based on visual scene descriptions in level 4, we use Googles API platform 6 for automated collection. Statistics on the Quality of the Image Collection Generally, approximately 1,000 images in the test samples (17%) were replaced by humancollected ones. During this process, annotators not only need to ensure that the images show proper scenarios in the expected locations, but also need to consider the diversity of the images and avoid potential ethical risks, such as gender and racial biases. For example, even if an image is highquality, if it appears multiple times (>2 times) in the dataset, it is replaced with new one. Besides, suppose an annotator repeatedly encounters images showing women doing housework\" and relatively few men doing housework\" images. In that case, they need to replace some of the women doing housework\" images with men doing housework\". Thanks to the carefully designed role definitions, which consider avoiding potential bias, the automatically generated visual scene descriptions have largely avoided such biases, and we encountered less than 1% of such biased cases during the quality control process. B.3 Query Collection The query collection in Figure 2 involves three prompt templates, which are used for describing collected images, generating several candidate queries, and selecting the best query, respectively, as shown in Table 12. Statistics on the Quality of the Query Collection Thanks to the well-designed query collection strategy and high-quality human-checked images, only about 20 queries (0.3%) were found to be unanswerable and revised by annotators.

The permanent roles are underlined, which occupy the majority of an individuals daily working time. understanding of the quality control requirements. Following this, the benchmark construction manager, with the help of two other annotators, checked the samples replaced by the annotators. Finally, the benchmark construction manager provided feedback to the annotators to help them better comprehend the quality control requirements. B.5 Evaluation Method Oracle Guidance Collection To collect the oracle guidance for each test sample, we adopt collaboration manner with human annotators and GPT-4o. Specifically, we first use GPT-4o to collect each individuals expectations in each location, resulting in 100 general expectations in total. Then, we ask human annotators to carefully check the general expectations obtained above. Finally, each individuals general expectation in each location is used for constructing prompt using the prompt template in Table 13, which is then used for generating the oracle guidance for each test sample. Dimensions of Evaluation Criteria In Section 4.2, we propose an automatic evaluation method, which breaks down the evaluation criteria into five dimensions. The detailed descriptions of the five dimensions are as follows: 1. Role-Set Awareness (RSA): Does this response consider your multiple roles and responsibilities (especially the primary role in the specific scenario), providing advice or information specifically tailored to support you effectively? The response should provide tailored advice or information to effectively support you, acknowledging only the roles that are essential in the current context. 2. Body Behavior Awareness (BBA): Does this response offer guidance or strategies that help you achieve your desired body behavior? 3. Mind Feelings Awareness (MFA): Does this response provide support and address the emotional needs necessary for you to achieve your desired mind feelings? 4. Contextual Awareness (CA): Does this response accurately address your query, maintaining focus on the main intent without deviation? Is the response relevant to your specific scenario, including location and situational factors? 5. Conversational Flow (CF): Does this response encourage ongoing interaction by being engaging and naturally flowing? Is the response appropriately concise or detailed, delivering information that strikes balance for optimal understanding? Prompt for Evaluation The prompt used for evaluation is presented in Table 14. Considering the cost, we use GPT-4o-mini for all evaluations, which, through our human evaluation, demonstrates reliable evaluation quality (Figure 5). B.6 Word Cloud Visualization of"

The prompt template used for such estimation is shown in Table 15. Besides, we also need to estimate the possible optimal action that the individual can take after receiving the personalized response from the personalized VLM assistant. The prompt template used for such estimation is shown in Table 16. C.1.2 Personalized Response Sampling In Section 5.2, we design two agents, i.e., the KeyPoints Generator (KeyG) and Response Generator (ResG), to cooperate for sampling multiple Figure 6: Word cloud visualization of user queries from the test split of LS1 and LS2 subsets, illustrating the variety of queries in the dataset. Note that LS2 includes an individual who is child, and individuals may frequently encounter scenarios in various locations where child-related issues need to be addressed. This results in significant number of queries involving child. personalized responses. The number of candidate sampled responses is set as = 6, including the initial response. The prompt templates designed for the KeyG and ResG agents are presented in Table 17. C.1.3 Reward Model Construction As shown in Figure 4, to construct the reward model, we first collect preference pairs used for reward model training using the negative Role-Set. The negative Role-Set selection is based on the different roles in certain locations. For example, for visual scene in Museum, the currently focused positive Role-Set is Father@Home; Fireman@Community; Visitor@Museum Passenger@Airport; Customer@Store. Then, one of the Negative Role-Set can be Mother@Home; Member@Community; Guide@Museum; Passenger@Airport; Customer@Store. Then, we adopt the collected preference pairs to train the VLM to be task-specific reward model via SFT. To avoid position bias, we construct two SFT samples with different response orders for each collected preference pair. We show an example of the SFT sample for the reward model training in Table 18. C.1.4 Optimal Response Selection For the pair comparisons in the process of optimal response selection, we adopt the same prompt template as in the reward model training, i.e., Table 18. C.1.5 Optimization The implementation of the SFT loss in Eq. 2 follows the trl 7. Specifically, the learning rate is 2e-4, the batch size is 4, the learning rate scheduler type is cosine, the warmup ratio is 0.03, the 7https://github.com/huggingface/trl optimizer is adamw_torch_fused, and the epoch is set as 4.

PCogAlign (S) and PCogAlign demonstrate similar performance, which might be attributed to the high quality of generated candidates during the personalized response sampling stage, thanks to the strong capabilities of Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct. As result, it only necessitates pairwise comparisons between the candidate responses and the initial response using the reward model, eliminating the need for best-of-n selection. Nonetheless, PCogAlign (S) also relies on the constructed reward model to select responses, which still demonstrates the importance of the constructed reward model. I.
