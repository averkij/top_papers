It involves interpreting contextual clues within an image, such as architectural styles, road signs, natural landscapes, and cultural markers. Inferring location from such diverse indicators demands advanced reasoning, making geolocation challenging task for both artificial models and human experts [20]. Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Trovato et al. hand, some tasks are highly challenging, where only few users spend considerable time before providing accurate answers. Unlike previous approaches that address this task with coarse level of granularity, we conduct comprehensive evaluation of recent advanced LVMs on GeoComp, where the models are required to reason and predict the exact city of given location. Our findings reveal that this task poses significant challenge for existing LVM models. To address this, we introduce Geographical Chain of Thought (GeoCoT) approach, which automatically guides the reasoning process through multi-step analysis of geographical cues, such as landmarks, environmental features, and spatial relationships. For the evaluation of the reasoning process, we propose set of articulated evaluation metrics, named as GeoEval including comparison with ground truth reasoning data and intrinsic evaluation. The results demonstrate that our GeoCoT paradigm significantly improves geolocation accuracy. It not only helps break down complex tasks into manageable reasoning steps but also enhances the interpretability of the inference process. Our work makes key contributions to geolocation. First, we present GeoComp, large-scale, human-annotated geolocation dataset with over 3.9 million tasks and 25 million human player annotations, featuring diverse geographic regions, languages, and environmental contexts. These annotations identify high-difficulty geolocation cases and establish benchmarks to guide future advancements. Second, we introduce the Geographical Chain of Thought (GeoCoT) framework, multi-step reasoning approach that improves geolocation accuracy by leveraging geographical cues like landmarks, environmental features, and spatial relationships. Finally, through comprehensive evaluations involving human assessments and LLM inferences, we show that GeoCoT improves predictive performance by up to 25% while enhancing interpretability."

            "content": "Figure 1: The gaming logic of our platform: Two players independently guess the location based on the same image and their own hints, with scores determined by the distance between their predictions and the ground truth location. Significant effort has been devoted to solving the geolocation task, but often at coarse level of granularity. For example, methods like Im2GPS3K [50] and PlaNet [53] frame the task by dividing the globe into grid cells and training deep neural networks to predict the correct cell for given image. Subsequent studies improve precision by retrieving the most visually similar image from dataset and using its coordinates as the predicted location [38, 76]. The reason for this coarse granularity in many approaches is potentially due to the lack of high-quality datasets. For example, Im2GPS3K contains up to 35% non-localizable images [1], while the YFC100M dataset includes irrelevant data such as indoor photos and food images, which provide little to no locational information [47]. Additionally, many datasets are limited in size, with Georeasoner [24] featuring only 3K images, thereby restricting the robustness and generalizability of geolocation models. comparison of these datasets is shown in Table 1. To address the above obstacles, in this work, we leverage the contributions of hundreds of thousands of geolocation game enthusiasts who provide valuable annotation labels while playing the game. Specifically, we launched free, public-benefit-oriented online geoguessing website in June 2022 (tuxun.fun), as shown in Figure 1. Users are required to guess the latitude and longitude based on these images, which are sourced from Google Maps, Baidu Maps, and Gaode Maps. The platform offers various game formats, including team contests and solo matches. As of December 17, 2024, this platform has 740,468 users, 3,954,397 locations as unique geolocation tasks, and 25,355,174 human response records. We name the collected dataset GeoComp. This rich and valuable dataset of real human responses enables us to evaluate task difficulty and filter out unreasonable cases. For instance, some tasks are too easy, such as when the name of shopping mall in city is clearly visible in the image, enabling most users to answer correctly.

(c) Unlike previous datasets like OSV-5M, where single country (e.g., America) dominates 25% of the data, our dataset is balanced at country level. concerns about their quality for effectively evaluating geolocation capabilities. For instance, datasets derived from web scraping, such as YFCC100M [48] and Im2GPS3K [50], include significant proportion of images depicting food, art, pets, and personal photographs. These types of images are often weakly localizable or entirely non-localizable [47]. Street-view datasets also face limitations, such as restricted geographic coverage [1]; for example, [37]s work includes data from only three cities in the United States. Furthermore, dataset collection processes often introduce biases. For instance, some commonly used platforms are inaccessible in certain countries, resulting in uneven geographic representation. Additionally, the difficulty of individual geolocation tasks varies widely within these datasets, but this aspect has not been comprehensively evaluated. For example, images taken at prominent landmarks are relatively easy to geolocate, while others offer no clear hints and are highly challenging [1]. These limitations hinder the ability of current datasets to provide reliable benchmark for geolocation task."

The platform offers various engaging competition modes to enhance user experience, such as team contests and solo matches. Each competition consists of multiple questions, and teams are assigned vitality score. Users mark their predicted location on the map, and the evaluation is based on the ground truths surface distance from the predicted location. Larger errors result in greater deductions from the teams vitality score. At the end of the match, the team with the higher vitality score wins. We also provide diverse game modes, including street views, natural landscapes, and iconic landmarks. Users can choose specific opponents or engage in random matches. To prevent cheating, external search engines are banned, and each round is time-limited. To ensure predictions are human-generated rather than machine-generated, users must register with phone number, enabling tracking of individual activities.

Similarly, countrys performance score is the average score across all tasks performed within that country. Player Performance Across Levels. The performance of game players across different levels, as illustrated in Figure 3, highlights significant gaps between beginners and experts in mainstream countries. Expert players, defined as the top 15% of performers, consistently achieve much higher performance metrics compared to beginners, defined as the bottom 15%, with noticeable gaps in countries like Canada, China, and India. For example, in Canada, experts perform nearly 10 times better than beginners, underscoring the steep learning curve involved in mastering the game. This performance gap presents challenges for new players, as it emphasizes the level of skill, strategy, and game knowledge required to compete effectively at higher levels. Player Performance Across Countries. The player performance across countries, as shown in Figure 3, demonstrates significant variations influenced by three key factors: climate, geographic size, and language. Players tend to perform well in countries such Geolocation with Real Human Gameplay Data: Large-Scale Dataset and Human-Like Reasoning Framework Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Figure 4: Comparison of previous geolocation tasks and our proposed paradigm: while previous works focused on coarse-grained predictions limited by dataset quality, our generation and reasoning-based method enables fine-grained city-level predictions. as Germany, France, and Japan. These nations are characterized by unique languages and relatively small geographic sizes. The presence of distinctive languages on urban street signs provides clear linguistic clues, enabling players to quickly identify the country. Additionally, the compactness of these countries allows for more precise guesses, resulting in higher scores. In contrast, despite Chinas unique language, its vast size and diverse climates make pinpointing specific locations challenging, leading to lower scores. Similarly, large countries like the USA, China, and Canada face additional challenges due to their shared temperate climates and extensive territories, where players often confuse them due to similar vegetation and climate, reducing accuracy. Player Performance Across Tasks. From Figure 3, we can also observe significant variations in player performance across different tasks. In certain countries, player performance is relatively low, while in others, it is notably higher. This highlights the diversity in task difficulty within our dataset, offering valuable insights for assessing and categorizing task complexity."

            "content": "Concretely, GeoCoT operates in five sequential stages: 1. Continental or Climate Zone Identification. The process begins with identifying broad regions using natural features like mountains, vegetation, or soil, narrowing the scope to continent or climate zone. 2. Country-Level Localization. Cultural markers, language on signs, and architectural styles are analyzed to refine predictions to the country level. 3. City-Level Refinement Using Infrastructure. Street elements, such as driving direction, bollards, and license plate colors, are used to locate specific cities or regions. 4. LandmarkBased Verification. Features like fire hydrants, guideposts, and street signs help validate and further refine the predicted location. 5. Fine-Grained Micro-Level Validation. Finally, subtle details such as sidewalk patterns and clothing styles confirm precise localization at city or neighborhood level. Detailed prompts can be found in Appendix A. The answers generated at each of these stages are combined to produce the final predicted city, ensuring comprehensive and step-by-step reasoning process guided by LVMs. By emulating human reasoning, GeoCoT surpasses traditional methods by avoiding coarse classification grids and exhaustive image databases, providing scalable, interpretable, and accurate solution Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Trovato et al.

Finally, our model, GeoCoT, consistently achieves top performance across all nine metrics and three levels, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability in geolocation tasks. Additionally, GeoCLIP surpasses GPT-4o at the continent level, which can be attributed to its pretraining on imageGPS pairs, making it particularly well-suited for coarse-grained geolocation tasks. Coarse-grained continent-level predictions typically require less detailed local knowledge and instead rely on broader geographic cues, such as climate, landscapes, and cultural Geolocation with Real Human Gameplay Data: Large-Scale Dataset and Human-Like Reasoning Framework Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA markers. However, GeoCLIP performs poorly at finer granularities like country and city levels, suggesting that it lacks strong capability for geographic reasoning beyond direct visual features.

The metrics represent the proportion of predictions within three distance thresholds: Street (1 km), City (25 km), and Country (750 km). Higher values indicate better performance, with stricter thresholds assessing fine-grained localization and larger thresholds evaluating coarse-level accuracy. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama-3.2-vision outperform the dedicated large-scale model GeoCLIP for geolocation, even under finer-grained evaluation settings.

            "content": "Beyond evaluating overall task performance, we focus on analyzing the reasoning process of GeoCoT, which emulates human-like reasoning approach. To establish reference for this evaluation, three gaming enthusiasts collaboratively constructed reasoning processes for the same 500 cases based on geo-tagged locations, which we designated as the ground truth (GT). These GT annotations serve as benchmark within our evaluation framework, GeoEval. The evaluation process utilizes GPT-based assessment through GPTScore [13] and prompt-based scoring across three custom-defined aspects. The first dimension is the completeness of feature extraction (CE), which evaluates whether all key clues provided in the GT are comprehensively covered and accurately described in the reasoning process. Comprehensive feature extraction ensures that reasoning outcomes are based on sufficient factual evidence, thereby enhancing their reliability and accuracy. The second dimension is the accuracy of feature extraction (AE), which measures whether the identified and described attributes or characteristics of the key information in the GT are correct. Misidentified features can lead to reasoning outcomes that deviate from the facts, reducing the credibility of the results. The third dimension is the accuracy of reasoning and cue correspondence (AC), which assesses whether the reasoning process derives reasonable conclusions based on the extracted cues and maintains consistency with the reasoning logic presented in the GT. Incorrect correspondence between cues and conclusions can result in outcomes that deviate from reality. The final dimension is the logical coherence of reasoning (LC), which evaluates the consistency, logical flow, and adherence to common sense within the reasoning chain.

GeoCoT achieves the highest GPTScore of 0.728, outperforming GPT-4o (CoT) (0.663) and -1.6 (0.478), demonstrating its superior alignment with human-constructed reasoning processes. In terms of feature extraction, GeoCoT achieves CE score of 2.690 and an AE score of 3.538, significantly surpassing GPT-4o (CoT) and the dedicated GeoReasoner model. Furthermore, GeoCoTs performance in reasoning accuracy and logical coherence is unmatched, with AC and LC scores of 3.696 and 3.945, compared to GPT-4o (CoT), which scores 3.156 and 3.540, and GeoReasoner, which lags behind at 1.719 and 2.038. These results clearly demonstrate that GeoCoT not only captures key information more comprehensively but also maintains more accurate and logically coherent reasoning process compared to both reasoning-based models and traditional baselines like GeoReasoner."

Clues are shown in blue, correct predictions in green, incorrect in red, and vague/uncertain guesses in orange. Following previous work on assessing hallucinations in terms of objects, attributes, and relationships [25, 46], we evaluate the quality of synthetic data across three key dimensions: (1) Object Hallucination(OH): assesses whether the synthetic data includes objects that do not exist in the image. Object Hallucination evaluates the extent to which synthetic data introduces fictional elements. (2) Fact Hallucination(FH) measures the accuracy of factual information within the synthetic data. Fact Hallucination occurs when the synthetic data contains facts, figures, or other information that is incorrect or not supported by the original data. (3) Attribution Hallucination(AH) evaluates whether the synthetic data incorrectly attributes properties, characteristics, or relations to entities or objects. To evaluate these dimensions, we invited 2 human annotators with professional backgrounds in geographic reasoning and data validation to assess GPT-4o, GeoReasoner, and our proposed GeoCoT model. These three baselines provide textual reasoning processes across 1,500 evaluated cases. The results, shown in Table 5, indicate the number of errors in each dimension, demonstrating that GeoCoT significantly reduces hallucination errors compared to the other models."

We observe that state-of-the-art geolocation models, such as GeoCLIP, achieve performance on traditional geolocation tasks that surpass GPT-4o and are almost comparable to our model, GeoCoT. However, this result is inconsistent with the performance shown in Table 2, where GeoCLIP significantly underperforms GPT-4o on fine-grained city and country-level geolocation tasks. This indicates that these baseline models are overfitting on specific datasets and highlights the importance of comprehensive evaluation across different datasets.

            "content": "Data Ethics The creation and release of our dataset adhere to stringent ethical standards to ensure the privacy and well-being of all contributors. We have conducted rigorous anonymization of the dataset to protect user privacy. All personally identifiable information, such as usernames, email addresses, and IP addresses, has been permanently removed. Only non-identifiable behavioral data, such as prediction outcomes and timestamps, are retained. The dataset originates from user participation on our open-source geolocation game platform. Users were informed during the registration process that their activity data might be used for research purposes. This ensures transparency in data collection and maintains user trust. We have explicitly designed the dataset for research purposes, with the sole intention of advancing geolocation and related artificial intelligence technologies. Importantly, our dataset does not include the images directly but instead provides links to images hosted on platforms such as Google Maps or Baidu Maps, which can be accessed through their official APIs. We are committed to ensuring the responsible use of this dataset. Researchers accessing the data must agree to data usage agreement that prohibits unethical or illegal use. Detail of GeoCoT We present the detailed prompt of our GeoCoT process below: Question1: Are there prominent natural features, such as specific types of vegetation, landforms (e.g., mountains, hills, plains), or soil characteristics, that provide clues about the geographicalregion? Question2: Are there any culturally, historically, or architecturally significant landmarks, buildings, or structures, or are there any inscriptions or signs in specific language or script that could help determine the country or region? Question3: Are there distinctive road-related features, such as traffic direction (e.g., left-hand or righthand driving), specific types of bollards, unique utility pole designs, or license platecolors and styles, which countries are known to have these characteristics? Question4: Are there observable urban or rural markers (e.g., street signs, fire hydrants guideposts) , or other infrastructure elements, that can provide more specific information about the country or city? Question5: Are there identifiable patterns in sidewalks (e.g., tile shapes, colors, or arrangements), clothing styles worn by people, or other culturally specific details that can help narrow down the city or area? Lets think step by step. Based on the question provided, locate the location of the picture as accurately as possible. Identify the continent, country, and city, and summarize it into paragraph. For example: the presence of tropical rainforests, palm trees, and red soil indicates tropical climate... Signs in Thai, right-side traffic, and traditional Thai architecture further suggest it is in Thailand... Combining these clues, this image was likely taken in city in Bangkok, Thailand, Asia. Here, cyan highlights potential clues within the image to help the model infer geographic locations. Green defines the geographic scope inferred from the clues, such as region, country, or city. Orange provides detailed descriptions of the cyan clues, enhancing the models understanding. Red specifies the expected output format, including city, country, and continent. Human Annotation Example Below we show an example of human annotated ground truth to demonstrate the annotation process, criteria, and the reasoning behind the annotations, where clues are shown in blue, correct predictions in green. Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Trovato et al. The image shows rural residential area with dense trees and expansive green lawns. The terrain is flat, and the soil is reddish-brown, which matches the temperate climate of central Europe, particularly rural areas of France. The architectural style of the house is distinctive: red-tiled sloped roof, yellow walls, and solar panels, reflecting the regions focus on renewable energy, common feature in French countryside homes. The red mailbox at the gate is hallmark of rural French residences. The design of the fences and modern gates aligns with typical styles in the French countryside. The house design and surrounding natural environment suggest rural European region. Based on the architectural style, natural landscape, and street elements, the image was most likely taken in Aumont, France, Europe.
