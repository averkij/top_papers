Introduction Inferring 3D geometry from 2D observations remains long-standing challenge in computer vision, serving as fundamental pillar for numerous applications, ranging from autonomous navigation [14, 52, 72] and virtual reality [27, 93] to 3D/4D reconstruction [30, 41, 68, 77] and generation [64, 88]. However, its inherently ill-posed nature poses persistent difficulties in achieving reliable and consistent geometry estimation from diverse open-world videos. Pioneered by Marigold [36], recent methods harness diffusion models [4, 26, 59, 63] to generate affine-invariant depth maps [18, 19, 23, 25] or sequences [31, 62, 80], which is achieved by recasting depth cues as pseudo-RGB frames that are suitable for Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [37] processing. Although these methods exhibit remarkable spatial and temporal fidelity, the compression of unbounded depth values into the fixed input range of the VAE inevitably leads to non-trivial information loss, especially for distant scene elements, as shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, the absence of camera intrinsics and the presence of unknown shift values impede accurate 3D reconstruction, thereby limiting their utility in downstream applications. Another line of research [5, 56, 69, 70, 87] uses pretrained image foundation models to directly estimate metric depth or point maps. However, neglecting temporal context often induces flickering artifacts when applying these methods to videos. In this paper, we propose novel approach, named GeometryCrafter, to estimate high-fidelity and temporally coherent point maps from open-world videos. These point maps facilitate 3D/4D point cloud reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and the derivation of temporally consistent depth maps and camera intrinsics. Our method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities by exploiting the inherent video diffusion priors of natural videos. Central to our approach is novel point map VAE, tailored to effectively encode and decode unbounded 3D coordinates without compressing depth values into bounded range. It contains dual-encoder architecture: an encoder inherited from the original video VAE to capture the primary point map information, and newly designed residual encoder to embed the remaining information in latent offset. Leveraging this design, we can preserve the latent space analogous to the video VAE by regulating the adjusted latent code with the original video decoder. This analogous latent distribution enables the utilization of pre-trained diffusion weights for robust zero-shot generalizations. For VAE training, we disentangle the point map into log-space depth and diagonal field of view, rather than directly encoding 3D coordinates in the camera coordinate system or adopting cuboid-based representation as in prior works [69, 70]. This disentangled representation demonstrates enhanced suitability for the VAE to capture the intrinsic structure of the point map, largely attributed to its location invariance and resolution independence. For supervision, we augment the standard reconstruction objective with normal loss, multi-scale depth loss to enhance local Diffusion-based depth estimation methods, e.g., Figure 2. DepthCrafter [31] and DAV [80], suffer from significant metric errors in distant regions due to the compression of unbounded depth values into the bounded input range of VAEs. geometric fidelity, and regularization term penalizing deviations from the original latent distribution. Furthermore, our GeometryCrafter integrates diffusion U-net that generates point map latents from video latents, forming robust framework for producing high-fidelity and temporally coherent point maps from open-world videos. We comprehensively evaluate GeometryCrafter on diverse datasets, ranging from static to dynamic scenes, indoor to outdoor environments, and realistic to cartoonish styles. Our method significantly outperforms existing methods by large margin, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our proposed components, and demonstrate the applicability of our method to 3D/4D point cloud reconstruction and camera pose estimation. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We present GeometryCrafter, novel approach for estimating high-fidelity and temporally coherent geometry from diverse open-world videos. We propose point map VAE for effective encoding and decoding of point maps, which employs dual-encoder architecture to maintain the latent space analogous to the inherited video VAE for generalization ability. We introduce the disentangled point map representation and multi-scale depth loss to train the VAE, significantly improving the robustness and fidelity of our method. 2. Related Works Monocular depth estimation (MDE). MDE methods [1, 3, 15, 17, 40, 43, 44, 53, 79] predict depth maps from single images or videos. To achieve zero-shot generalization, MiDaS [57] introduces affine-invariant supervision and trains on mixing datasets. Depth Anything [81] and its V2 [82] extend this framework to transformer-based architectures [51] and semi-supervised learning, using largeFigure 3. Architecture of our point map VAE. The point map VAE encodes and decodes point maps with unbounded values, alleviating the native encoder ESVD inherited from SVD captures the inaccurate prediction in distant regions. We adopt dual-encoder design: normalized disparity maps, while residual encoder EÏµ embeds remaining information as an offset. It preserves the original latent space by regulating the latents via the original decoder DSVD, enabling the utilization of pretrained diffusion priors. point map decoder Dpmap recovers the final point maps from the latent codes. scale unlabeled images for improved generalization. Pioneered by Marigold [36], recent works [18, 19, 23, 25, 55] adapt pretrained image diffusion models [59] to MDE by converting depth maps to pseudo-RGB representations and exclusively finetuning the U-net on depth latent codes, achieving superior quality and robustness. To generalize to videos, previous methods [10, 39, 47, 73, 83, 92] employ test-time optimization, memory mechanisms, or stabilization networks for temporal coherence, whereas recent studies [31, 62, 80] finetune video diffusion models [4] to yield high-quality, temporally consistent depth sequences. However, these methods ignore the camera intrinsic estimation and provide only affine-invariant depth, which is scale and shift ambiguous, hindering 3D accuracy and downstream applications that require projection into 3D space. Monocular geometry estimation (MGE). To overcome these limitations, MGE methods jointly infer camera parameters and metric or up-to-scale depth maps. LeRes [85, 86] utilizes 3D point cloud encoders to recover missing shift and focal parameters during depth estimation. UniDepth [56] decouples camera parameter prediction from depth estimation via pseudo-spherical 3D representation and camera self-prompting mechanism. DepthPro [5] introduces ViT-based design [51] for high-resolution depth estimation, coupled with dedicated image encoder for focal length prediction. DUSt3R [70] projects two-view images or identical pairs to scale-invariant point maps in camera space, facilitating the derivation of camera intrinsic and depth maps. MoGe [69] employs affine-invariant point maps to mitigate focal-distance ambiguity, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Besides, Metric3D [87] and its V2 [28] rely on user-provided camera parameters to estimate metrically accurate depth maps. However, these approaches are restricted to static images and incur flickering artifacts when directly applied to video sequences. phy visually hides secret information within existing features [2, 33, 95]. Previous works have demonstrated the capacity of neural networks to embed visual data within images or videos, such as invertible down-scaling [75], grayscaling [74], and mono-nizing [29]. The most relevant work to ours is LayerDiffuse [90], which conceals image transparency information within small perturbation in the latent space of Stable Diffusion [59]. Adhering to the same insight, we encode point maps into the latent space of diffusion models while preserving the underlying distribution, facilitating the utilization of pretrained diffusion models for geometry estimation. 3. Method Given an input RGB video RT HW 3, we aim to predict temporally consistent point map sequence RT HW 3 alongside valid mask [0, 1]T HW to exclude undefined regions (e.g., sky). Each point map contains the 3D coordinates = (xp, yp, zp)T in the camera coordinate system for every pixel. To this end, we propose GeometryCrafter, novel approach that leverages video diffusion models (VDMs) for robust point map estimation from open-world videos. We model the joint distribution P(p, v) in the latent space. While VDMs native VAE effectively encodes video frames and masks, accurate point map representation necessitates dedicated VAE tailored for geometric encoding and decoding. 3.1. Architecture of Point Map VAE Existing diffusion-based depth estimation methods [31, 80] simply employ the native VAE to encode and decode only partial information from the point maps, i.e. the normalized disparity maps (cid:101)xdisp: (cid:101)xdisp = 2 xdisp min(xdisp) max(xdisp) min(xdisp) 1, (1) Steganography and information hiding. Steganograxdisp = / zp, where is the baseline, is the focal length, and zp is the z-coordinate of the point map p. However, such normalization often misestimates depths in distant regions  (Fig. 2)  , resulting in geometric distortions due to compressing unbounded depths into the VAEs fixed input range. To this end, we propose point map VAE that directly handles point maps over the unbounded range [0, +]. Crucially, its latent distribution should be tightly aligned with that of the native VAE to fully exploit pre-trained VDMs. Inspired by LayerDiffuse [90], we propose dualencoder architecture: the inherited native encoder ESVD captures the primary point map features, while newly designed residual encoder EÏµ encodes remaining information as an offset (see Fig. 3). Given that the normalized disparity maps (cid:101)xdisp encapsulate significant relative depth cues, we employ ESVD on (cid:101)xdisp and harness EÏµ to embed the residual information into the offset. The final point map latent is obtained by their summation: (2) zpmap = ESVD((cid:101)xdisp) + EÏµ(p, m, (cid:101)xdisp), This dual-encoder architecture allows us to explicitly regularize the latent space of zpmap to avoid disrupting the original latent distribution. Considering most VAEs in VDM are diagonal Gaussian models (i.e. mean and variance), we apply the offset solely to the mean, retaining the original variance for simplicity. For decoding, we design dedicated decoder Dpmap to reconstruct both the point map (cid:98)p and the valid mask (cid:98)m: (cid:98)p, (cid:98)m = Dpmap(zpmap). To ensure temporal consistency, we employ temmporal layers in the decoder to capture the temporal dependencies across frames. (3) 3.2. Training of Point Map VAE Point map representation. The points = (xp, yp, zp)T are scattered non-uniformly across the view frustum, resulting in complex spatial distribution that poses challenge to deep networks in capturing their inherent structure. To mitigate this, existing point map estimation methods [69, 70] assume centered camera principal point and remap depth values into log-space, thereby projecting the points into cuboid domain: pcuboid = [xp/zp, yp/zp, log zp] . (4) However, this representation is suboptimal for our point map VAE. In particular, the first two channels of pcuboid encode ray directions from the camera center to each pixel, conveying location-specific information that diverges from the translation-invariant nature of RGB features. To address this discrepancy, we propose decoupling the point map into: pdec = [Î¸diag, log zp] , (5) Figure 4. Diffusion UNet. We jointly condition the diffusion model on video latents and per-frame geometry priors from an image MGE model Mimg. The geometry is encoded into latent space via our point map VAE, while the video latents are obtained from the native VAE. 2 + 2 / 2f denotes the diagonal field where Î¸diag = of view, constant map for all points in frame. Since pdec is independent of spatial location, it is more suitable for our VAE to learn an effective latent distribution. Moreover, this formulation enables us to train our network only on fixedresolution videos, while generalizing to varying resolutions and aspect ratios, owing to the invariance of Î¸diag. The original point map can be effortlessly recovered from pdec via the inverse perspective transformation. Loss functions. To train the point map VAE, we define reconstruction loss Lrecon as the L1 norm between the decoded depth and diagonal field of view and their ground truth counterparts. Besides, we also impose mask loss Lmask to exclude undefined regions, e.g. sky, as the L2 norm between the predicted and ground truth valid masks. To promote surface quality, we introduce normal loss Ln that supervises the normal maps derived from the reconstructed point maps and the ground truth, as well as multi-scale depth loss Lms that measures the alignment between reconstructed and ground truth depth maps within local regions, inspired by MoGe [69]. Importantly, to regularize our latent space agnostic to the original SVDs latent distribution, we employ loss term Lidentity to penalize the latent deviation: Lidentity = (cid:101)xdisp DSVD(zpmap)2 2. (6) The final training objective LVAE is defined as: LVAE = Lrecon + Lms + Î»nLn (cid:125) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) Lpmap +Lidentity + Î»maskLmask.

Diffusion UNet Since our point map VAE is meticulously designed and regularized to align closely with the original SVDs latent distribution, we can train diffusion UNet to estimate point maps from videos with only synthetic data, using the pretrained generative prior of video diffusion models. Although it significantly alleviates the issue of lacking highquality point map annotations in real-world videos, the synthetic data still suffers from limited diversity in camera intrinsics, which may degrade the generalization ability of diagonal field-of-view prediction on real-world scenarios. To mitigate this, alongside video latents, we propose the integration of per-frame geometry priors as conditioning inputs within the diffusion UNet, as shown in Fig. 4. We employ our point map VAE to encode the per-frame point maps predicted by MoGe [69] into the latent space to act as geometry priors that provide strong camera-intrinsic clues, although they may suffer from inaccuracies and flickering. Following DepthCrafter [31], we train the diffusion UNet with the EDM [35] pre-conditioning and noise schedule, and adopt multi-stage training strategy to capture long temporal context under GPU memory constraints. After training, the UNet can process videos with varying lengths (e.g. 1 to 110 frames) at time, and we adopt the stitching inference strategy [31] to handle videos with arbitrary lengths. Besides, inspired by recent advancements [19, 25] in reformulating the diffusion process into deterministic single-step framework for depth estimation, we also train deterministic variant by removing the noisy latent from input. 4. Experiments 4.1. Implementation Details We build GeometryCrafter upon the SVD [4] framework. The residual encoder and point decoder in the point map VAE adopt the same architecture as in SVDs VAE, supplemented by zero convolution [91] in the output layers. We collected 14 synthetic RGBD datasets [8, 16, 22, 32, 34, 42, 49, 50, 58, 60, 66, 67, 71, 94], comprising 1.85M frames, for training. Among these, 11 datasets can form 12K video clips with up to 150 frames each. For training stability, we normalize point clouds with shared scale factor across frames, yielding up-to-scale point clouds akin to structurefrom-motion [61]. We first train the point map VAE from scratch on RGBD images with an AdamW [46] optimizer at learning rate of 104 for 40K iterations, then finetune on video data for an additional 20K iterations. The diffusion UNet is finetuned with learning rate of 105 for 40K and 30K iterations in two stages. All experiments are conducted on 8 GPUs and take about 3 days. Further details are in the supplementary material. 4.2. Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluation Evaluation protocol. For evaluation, we employ seven datasets unseen during training: GMU Kitchens [21] and ScanNet [12] are captured with Kinect for indoor scenes; DDAD [24] and KITTI [20] are collected via lidar sensors for outdoor driving; Monkaa [48] and Sintel [7] are synthetic datasets with precise depth annotations and challenging dynamics; and DIODE [65] is high-resolution Figure 5.

To assess upto-scale point map quality, we use the relative point error Relp and percentage of inliers Î´p (threshold 0.25), following MoGe [69]. We align predicted point maps with ground truth by optimizing shared scale factor across the entire video for all methods. We also evaluate derived depth sequences using the absolute relative error Reld and the inlier percentage Î´d (threshold 1.25), following [31]. Evaluation on point maps. We compare our method with representative point map estimation approaches, e.g., DUSt3R [70], MonST3R [89], UniDepth [56], DepthPro [5], and MoGe [69]. Among them, DUSt3R and MonST3R are designed for two-view scenarios, addressing static and dynamic scenes, respectively, and are evaluated by inputting two identical frames. For MonST3R, we also evaluate with its post-processing, which requires external optical flows to refine global point clouds and poses. As shown in Tab. 1, our method outperforms others on most benchmarks, with substantial gains on the challenging Monkaa and Sintel datasets. Although UniDepth shows better performance on KITTI (likely due to training on DrivingStereo [78] with shared LiDAR sensor), our approach attains superior average rank. For the image benchmark DIODE, our method still achieves competitive performance compared to methods specialized for static images. Notably, some methods are trained on ScanNet [12] or ScanNet++ [84], violating the zero-shot evaluation, yet our method sustains comparable accuracy on ScanNet. Moreover, visual comparisons in Fig. 5 indicate that only our method can produce temporally consistent point maps with Figure 6. Qualitative comparison of depth map estimation.

Ablation Study Effectiveness of point map VAE. We conduct ablation studies by removing the point map VAE and using SVDs VAE to encode normalized disparity maps while keeping other components unchanged and retraining the model. As shown in Tab. 3, the estimated depth maps exhibit significant performance drop across various datasets, except for KITTI, where the ground truth is constrained by the LiDAR sensors range. The visual comparison in Fig. 7 reveals that the performance decline is due to information loss from compressing unbounded depth values into bounded range, leading to the neglect of distant objects. Components in point map VAE. We perform ablation studies to examine the effectiveness of the point map representation, multi-scale loss Lms, temporal layers in the decoder, and latent alignment. As shown in Tab. 4, the decoupled point map representation Eq. (5) markedly enhances reconstruction fidelity. Results in the second to fourth rows also highlight the importance of multi-scale supervision in Table 4. VAE reconstruction performance with different components.

Eliminating the latent alignment component not only increases point map errors (see the last two rows of Tab. 4), but also hinders effectively leveraging video diffusion priors. As shown in Tab. 5 and Fig. 8, latent alignment substantially improves the quality and robustness of point map predictions. UNet design. We investigate the impact and robustness of per-frame geometry priors derived from MoGe [69] by excluding them from the UNet input and replacing MoGe with DUSt3R [70]. As shown in Tab. 5, per-frame priors benefit the model across diverse scenarios by compensating for limited camera intrinsics in the training data. Moreover, replacing MoGe with DUSt3R also consistently improves performance, confirming the robustness of our method to different priors. Besides, we present two variants of the UNet: one with the diffusion framework (noted as Ours(G)) and the other with deterministic scheme (noted as Ours(D)). As shown in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, the deterministic approach exhibits slightly lower accuracy but achieves 1.1 acceleration in inference speed, e.g. 4.1 v.s. 3.7 FPS at 448 768 resolution on our experimental setup. Users may choose one of the two variants based on their requirements for speed or accuracy. 4.4. Applications 3D/4D reconstruction. With our temporally consistent, high-quality point maps, we enable 3D/4D reconstruction, whose cornerstone is the camera pose estimation. To this end, if dynamic objects exist, we first obtain their masks using SegmentAnything [38] and XMem [11]. Then, we detect interest points in the static regions with SuperPoint [13] Figure 9. Application of depth-conditioned video generation. The prompt is car is drifting on roads, snowy day, artstation. and track them via SpaTracker [76]. Finally, we optimize the camera poses with the established correspondences by 3D geometric constraints, taking only few minutes to converge. Examples of 3D/4D reconstruction are shown in Fig. 1 and supplementary materials. Depth-conditioned video generation. Depth sequences are pivotal to controllable video generation, capturing the inherent 3D structures of videos. Our consistent depth maps serve directly as conditioning inputs in existing depthdriven methods (e.g., Control-A-Video [9]), enabling creative outputs as shown in Fig. 9. 5. Conclusion We present GeometryCrafter, novel method that estimates temporally consistent, high-quality point maps from openworld videos, facilitating downstream applications such as 3D/4D reconstruction and depth-based video editing or generation. Our core design is point map VAE that learns latent space agnostic to original video latent distribution, enabling effective encoding and decoding of unbounded point map values. We also introduce decoupled point map representation to eliminate the location-dependent characteristics of point maps, enhancing the robustness to resolutions and aspect ratios. Furthermore, we integrate perframe geometry prior conditioned diffusion model to model the distribution of point sequences conditioned on the input videos. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that our method outperforms prior methods in performance and generalization. Its main limitation is relatively high computational and memory overhead due to the large model size."

Datasets 1.1. Training Datasets We collect 14 open-source synthetic RGBD datasets to facilitate the training of GeometryCrafter, among which 11 can be composited into video sequences. To construct the training video dataset, we extract non-overlapping segments with sequence length not exceeding 150 frames. An overview of the training datasets is provided in Tab. 1, categorized into four distinct domains: indoor, outdoor, in-thewild and driving scenarios. It is noteworthy that the frame count may slightly differ from the original datasets, owing to the exclusion of invalid frames. To ensure computational efficiency and adhere to GPU memory constraints, we preprocess all images and videos to standardized resolution of 320 640. Specifically, we apply cover resizing while preserving the original aspect ratio, followed by center cropping to achieve the desired resolution. Additionally, we implement random resizing as technique for augmenting camera intrinsics. 1.2. Evaluation Datasets We exhaustively evaluate GeometryCrafter and previous state-of-the-art methods using seven datasets with ground truth labels that remain entirely unseen during the training phase. Notably, to ensure compatibility with most baselines, such as MoGe [69] and UniDepth [56], which necessitate an input image aspect ratio of less than 2, we preprocess the evaluation datasets in the following manner: GMU Kitchens [21]: All scenarios are employed for evaluation. For each scenario, we extract 110 frames with stride of 2 to ensure extensive spatial coverage while preserving temporal coherence. To reduce memory usage during evaluation, we downsample the generated 1920p videos and ground truth depth maps to resolution of 960 540. ScanNet [12]: Following DepthCrafter [31], we select 100 scenes from the test split for evaluation, wherein each video comprises 90 frames with frame stride of 3. Due to the discrepancy in resolutions between the RGB images and depth maps, we first resize the RGB images to align with the depth maps, followed by center cropping to remove the black space around RGB images, yielding videos of resolution 624 464 . DDAD [24]: All 50 sequences from the validation split of the DDAD dataset are utilized for evaluation, with sequence lengths of either 50 or 100 frames. Owing to the high memory demands of the raw resolution 19361216, we apply center cropping to reduce the resolution to 1920 1152, followed by downsampling to 640 384 for evaluation. The ground truth depth maps, acquired via LiDAR sensors, are inherently sparse; consequently, the preprocessing has negligible influence on the comparative analysis of various methods. KITTI [20]: All sequence in the valid split of depth annotated dataset are used evaluation. For excessively long video sequences, we extract the initial 110 frames, resulting in 13 videos with sequence lengths ranging between 67 and 110 frames. Given that the original resolution of 1242 375 fails to conform to the aspect ratio requirements of most baseline methods, we apply center cropping to achieve resolution of 736 368. Monkaa [48]:We select 9 scenes from the original dataset for evaluation, truncating each video sequence to 110 frames while maintaining the original resolution of 960 540. To derive valid masks, we manually annotate the sky regions within each sequence. Sintel [7]: All sequences within the training split are employed for evaluation, with sequence lengths ranging between 21 and 50 frames. Given the original resolution of 1024 436 for each image, we apply cropping to achieve standardized resolution of 872 436. DIODE [65]: We utilize all 771 images from the validation split of DIODE for evaluation purposes. To address the noisy values along the edges of objects within the depth maps, we employ Canny filter to detect edge regions, subsequently refining the valid masks based on the filtering outcomes. 2. Loss Functions of VAE and UNet To train the point map VAE, we define the loss function Lpmap to measure the reconstruction errors of point maps. The reconstruction loss Lrecon for each valid pixel is defined as the L1 norm Lrecon = (cid:88) pM zp (cid:98)zp1 + (cid:88) pM Î¸diag (cid:98)Î¸diag1 (8) where = {pm(p) = 1} and (cid:98)zp, (cid:98)Î¸diag are the reconstructed values at pixel p. To enhance surface quality, we additionally supervise the normal maps derived from the reconstructed point maps and the ground truth: Ln = (cid:88) pM (1 np (cid:98)np) (9) To enhance supervision for local geometry, we draw inspiration from MoGe [69] and propose multi-scale depth loss function that measures the alignment between reconstructed and ground truth depth maps within local regions HÎ±, parameterized by scale Î± (cid:88) (cid:88) Lms = HÎ± pHÎ±&pM (zp zp,HÎ± ) ((cid:98)zp (cid:101)zp,HÎ± )1 (10) Here, zp,HÎ± and (cid:101)zp,HÎ± are the mean value of predicted and ground truth depth map defined on local region HÎ±. In practice, we split video frames into non-overlapped patches of size Î± to define the local regions. The reconstruction objective Lpmap is thus given by Î± Lpmap = Lrecon + Lms + Î»nLn (11) Following LayerDiffuse [90], we apply the frozen decoder DSVD to measure the extent to which the latent offset disrupts the modified latent distribution during training, given by 2 = (cid:101)xdisp DSVD(zpmap) Lidentity = (cid:101)xdisp (cid:98)xdisp2 where 2 2 denotes the mean square loss function. Additionally, we introduce mask loss to regularize the reconstructed valid mask: 2 (12) Lmask = (cid:98)m m2 where RT HW is the ground truth valid mask. The final training objective of VAE is defined as (13) 2 LVAE = Lidentity + Lpmap + Î»maskLmask (14) To finetune the UNet DÎ¸ parameters on the adjusted latent space obtained by our proposed point map VAE, we employ the objective LUNet for supervision, written as Eztp(z,Ït),Ïtp(Ï)[Î»Ït DÎ¸(zt; Ït, zv, zprior)zpmap2 2] (15) Here the noisy latent input zt is generated by adding Gaussian noise to the latent code zpmap. zv is the conditional latent code of input video. zprior denotes the per-frame geometry priors provided by MoGe [69]. Ït denotes noise level at time t, satisfying log Ït (Pmean, Pstd) with Pmean = 0.7 and Pstd = 1.6 adopted in the EDM [35] noise schedule and Î»Ït is weight parameter at time t. 3. More Implementation Details For the point map VAE design, we reuse the architecture of SVDs VAE with minor modification: we adopt zero convolution initialization [91] to the output convolution layer of encoder and apply scale factor of 0.1 to ensure that latent offsets do not disrupt the latent distribution during the initial stage of training. Inspired by the training strategy of SVD, we first train the model from scratch with an AdamW [46] optimizer on RGBD images, with fixed learning rate of 1e-4 for 40K iterations. Then, we finetune the temporal layers in the decoder for another 20K iterations on video data. The batch sizes are set to be 64 and 8 for the respective stages, with sequence lengths randomly sampled from [1, 8] for video data in the second stage. For the UNet denoiser, we initialize UNet with the pretrained parameters provided by DepthCrafter [31], finetuning it with learning rate of 1e-5 and batch size of 8. We train our diffusion UNet in two stages, where we first train it on videos with sequence lengths sampled from [1, 25] frames to adapt the model to our generation task, and then solely finetune the temporal layers with the sequence length randomly sampled from [1, 110] frames due to the limitation of GPU memory. After training, the UNet can process videos with varying lengths (e.g., 1 to 110 frames) at time. Both components are trained on 320 640 images or videos for efficiency, with random resizing and center cropping applied for data augmentation and resolution alignment. All trainings are conducted on 8 GPUs, with the entire process requiring about 3 days. 4. Camera Pose Estimation To recover camera poses from point maps, we need to establish correspondences of the static background across frames. We first obtain the dynamic object masks by annotating the first frame using SegmentAnything [38], and then apply XMem [11], robust method for video object segmentation, to generate the dynamic target masks for the subsequent frames. Given the dynamic masks, we adopt SuperPoint [13] to detect reliable points of interest in the first visual analysis in Fig. 2. Our method achieves robust and sharp point map estimation compared to other methods. In contrast, UniDepth [56] fails to segment the sky region from the input frames, while MoGe [69] struggles to handle finegrained structure. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the point maps aligned with the optimized camera poses, where the rows from left to right are 4 input frames uniformly sampled from the whole video and two views of aligned point maps in the world coordinates. We only provide the results of concatenating 8 point maps sampled from the predicted point sequences for better visualization. Table 2.

After that, we employ SpaTracker [76] to generate the 2D trajectory of each point, which is subsequently used to form the constraints for the camera pose optimization. Let pt denote the XY coordinate of 2D trajectory at time step t, the 2D point pt can be lifted to the world coordinate (cid:101)pt using the following transformation (cid:101)pt = 1 Ï1 Kt (pt, D(pt)) (16) Here Wt denotes the camera pose at time step t, D() denotes the scale-invariant depth value obtained from our predicted point maps and Ï1 refers to the back-projection of Kt the 2D point to camera coordinate with camera intrinsic K, which can also be estimated from the point maps. For time step t, the 2D projected coordinate should align with the trajectory position at timestep t. Therefore, we formulate the camera pose estimation as the following problem min W1...WT (cid:88) i,j[1...T ] ÏKj WjW 1 Ï1 Ki [pi, D(pi)] [pj, D(pj)]2 2 (17) Due to the sequence length limitation of SpaTracker (12 for each segment), we apply shifted window strategy with 6 overlapping frames to regularize the optimization of all camera poses. The optimization process for each scene takes from less than 1 minute to several minutes, relying on the number of frames. 5. Limitations The major limitation of our method is the expensive computation and memory cost, primarily attributing to the large model size inherent in both the VAE and U-Net architectures. As shown in Tab. 2, we provide comparison of the inference times of different components in GeometryCrafter. Our experiments are conducted on single GPU, revealing that the decoder of the point map VAE is the bottleneck during inference. How to design lightweight decoder capable of producing temporally consistent outputs will be focal point of our future works. 6.

We provide more results on Sora [6]-generated videos to demonstrate the temporal consistency and geometry quality of our method, as shown in Fig. 1. For comprehensive comparison with MGE methods, we provide Figure 1. Visual results on Sora-generated videos.
