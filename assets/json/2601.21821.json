            "content": "Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have led to substantial improvements in visual reasoning capabilities [55, 60]. State-of-the-art (SOTA) proprietary systems such as GPT-5 [35] and Gemini 3 [13] achieve strong performance on complex multimodal tasks, benefiting from access to massive, carefully curated private datasets. Mounting evidence suggests that the quality and structure of training data plays central role in unlocking strong reasoning abilities [57]. 1 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods Figure 1: Average score across mathematical reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks. MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B demonstrates strong performance relative to thinking models with significantly more parameters. In the text domain, this data-centric paradigm has proven highly effective. The release of DeepSeekR1 [10] and its distilled variants have further highlighted that constructing high-quality post-training data is key to closing the gap with proprietary models. Recent works [15, 36, 54, 21, 28, 34, 20] have extensively investigated pipelines for building high-quality training data, enabling open models to approach proprietary performance. However, extending this success to the multimodal setting remains challenging. The open-source community still struggles to produce multimodal datasets that match the scale, consistency, and reasoning depth of those used by leading proprietary models. Although recent efforts such as FineVision [46] and LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 [2] have expanded both the quality and quantity of available data, two critical limitations persist: Data imbalance: While VQA data derived from natural images and documents is largely sufficient, high-quality visual reasoning samplesparticularly for STEM diagrams and visual puzzlesremain scarce due to inherent data rarity and high annotation costs [22]. Inconsistent reasoning quality: Unlike the text domain, where distillation from strong teacher models such as DeepSeek-R1 has become standard practice for obtaining high-quality rationales. Multimodal datasets remain fragmented and heterogeneous in annotation style, with limited availability of interpretable, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision [39, 33]. These limitations hinder principled, data-centric research on multimodal reasoning. natural solution is to distill reasoning traces from capable multimodal teacher. The recently released Qwen3-VL series [3] demonstrates strong visual reasoning capabilities approaching proprietary systems, making it promising candidate for scalable data synthesis. Motivated by this, we introduce MMFineReason, an open-source dataset of over 1.8M samples with 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235BA22B-Thinking. As illustrated in Figure 2, we build the dataset in three stages: (1) Data Aggregation and Standardization, where we collect, clean, and unify raw multimodal data from diverse sources 2 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods Figure 2: MMFineReason data pipeline and the two-stage training. Illustrating data construction, annotation, selection, mixing, and model training (SFT and RL) in our framework. into canonical schema; (2) Reasoning Distillation, where we generate detailed, visually grounded reasoning traces using the SOTA teacher model; and (3) Data Selection, where we conduct rigorous quality verification and difficulty-based filtering to ensure both correctness and training efficiency. By fine-tuning Qwen3-VL-Instruct on our constructed MMFineReason dataset, we obtain MMFineReason2B/4B/8B models with superior performance. As shown in Figure 1, our models establish new SOTA among open-source models of comparable size. Notably, MMFineReason-4B can surpass Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We design systematic pipeline integrating data collection, filtering, and CoT distillation to construct MMFineReason-1.8M, the first large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 5.1B tokens with high-quality annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. We develop the MMFineReason model family (2B/4B/8B) by fine-tuning Qwen3-VL-Instruct on this dataset. Notably, our models exhibit exceptional scaling efficiency: MMFineReason-4B surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, while MMFineReason-8B outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3BThinking and approaches the performance of Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking. We demonstrate that training with reasoning-oriented data, such as STEM, puzzles, games, diagrams, yields synergistic effect, driving simultaneous improvements in both specialized reasoning capabilities and general model performance. We adopt difficulty-aware filtering strategy to construct efficient fine-tuning subsets, specifically MMFineReason-123K and MMFineReason-586K. Remarkably, fine-tuning on just 7% of the data selected achieves performance comparable to training on the full dataset. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on training strategies and data composition, providing key insights and practical recipes for multimodal reasoning model development. 3 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods In summary, MMFineReason serves as high-quality training resource and reproducible framework for building open-source VLMs with robust reasoning capabilities, fostering principled exploration of data-centric strategies in multimodal reasoning."

With strong pretrained backbone, training on only 5.1B tokens is sufficient to surpass larger open-source models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-thinking) and achieve performance comparable to advanced closed-source models (e.g., GPT-5-mini-high). severe cross-domain imbalance in data distribution and difficulty. large portion of the current training data is overly simple (67%), while puzzle-style problems are significantly harder and remain underrepresented compared to STEM reasoning data. Difficulty-aware filtering is highly effective. The difficulty-filtered MMFineReason123K dataset achieves performance close to the full dataset using only 7% of the data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency gains. reasoning-oriented data mixing strategy enables simultaneous gains in general and reasoning tasks. Only few amount of general data improves both general-purpose tasks and reasoning benchmarks in synchronized manner. Ultra-high resolution offers diminishing returns for reasoning. Extremely large input resolutions (e.g., 20482) bring limited benefits for reasoning tasks, while general vision tasks still require higher resolutions. Caption augmentation provides marginal benefit once chains-of-thought are mature. When the reasoning chain is already well-formed, concatenating an additional caption brings almost no further improvement."

            "content": "Multimodal reasoningincluding mathematical problem solving, visual logical reasoning, and chart understandingis key challenge for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. Prior work has demonstrated that data is central factor driving the advancement of model reasoning ability [60, 36]. However, in the multimodal domain, data acquisition and synthesis are considerably more difficult [46]. Many proprietary models rely on large-scale private datasets [13, 35, 3], resulting in significant data gap. In contrast, the open-source community still lacks multimodal reasoning datasets of substantial scale. To support VL reasoning, several datasets have been proposed, such as MathV360K [41] and LLaVACoT [51]. However, these datasets primarily focus on mathematical reasoning and therefore provide limited coverage. Although FineVision [46] attempts large-scale data aggregation, its content is relatively coarse, includes low-quality data sources, and omits many reasoning-oriented datasets. To address these limitations, we conduct the most extensive collection and integration of existing multimodal reasoning data to date, and further provide high-quality reference answers to support research in the open-source community. 4 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods"

ShareGPT4V [7] leveraged GPT-4V [53] and ShareCaptioner to produce large-scale image descriptions, with lengthand content-based filtering to ensure data quality. Other approaches, such as SynthVLM [26] and FUSION [27], further scale up existing datasets by generating synthetic images. Parallel to advancements in the visual domain, significant progress has been made in constructing text-only reasoning data [37, 38, 20]. With the emergence of DeepSeek-R1 [10] and its high-performance distilled models, recent efforts such as OpenR1 [15] and OpenThoughts [36] have built open and transparent data construction pipelines, enabling the open-source community to approach the capability levels of proprietary systems using only public data [16]. Despite this progress, the multimodal field still lacks transparent and reproducible data curation and training pipelines capable of achieving performance parity with closed-source systems. To this end, we introduce MMFineReason, high-quality and fully reproducible data construction pipeline that helps open-source multimodal models progressively narrow the performance gap with closed-source systems at reasonable cost. Importantly, our data construction workflow is entirely based on locally deployed open-source models and does not rely on any closed-source APIs."

            "content": "Data Collection. We initiate our data construction by aggregating diverse array of multimodal datasets from the open-source community. We first leverage FineVision [46], an extensive collection of visual instruction datasets. We conduct rigorous manual inspection of each candidate source, filtering out datasets unrelated to STEM or reasoning tasks. To expand the coverage of mathematical reasoning, scientific reasoning, and visual games & puzzles, we further incorporate high-quality datasets such as BMMR [48], Euclid30K [19], Zebra-CoT-Physics [18], and GameQA-140K [42]. This strategic expansion ensures more balanced and challenging coverage of scientific and puzzle-solving domains. For comprehensive details and inclusion criteria, please refer to Appendix A. Data Cleaning. We implement comprehensive data cleaning pipeline to guarantee the linguistic consistency, textual cleanliness, and reasoning suitability of the collected samples. The cleaning prompt is detailed in Prompt 11 (see Appendix for representative noise cases). The procedure includes: Language Standardization: To unify the linguistic landscape of the corpus, we translate nonEnglish questions found in datasets like BMMR and Euclid30K into English. Noise Removal: We sanitize question text by removing extraneous artifacts, including webpage links, corrupted characters, formatting residues, problem indices, and score annotations. Instruction Refinement: We reformulate prompts that solicit shallow responses (e.g., directly give the answer) into directives that explicitly encourage analytical thinking (e.g., provide your answer after careful reasoning). This step is crucial for eliciting high-quality reasoning traces during distillation. Task Suitability Filtering: We filter out tasks that fall outside the scope of visual analytical reasoning, such as coding exercises or generation-based drawing tasks, ensuring the dataset remains focused on logical problem-solving. 5 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods We further perform automatic image cleaning [46] by discarding corrupted or unreadable images, resizing those with longest side exceeding 2048 pixels while preserving aspect ratio, and converting all images uniformly to the RGB color space. Data Standardization. The landscape of multimodal datasets is characterized by significant fragmentation and lack of standardization. The heterogeneity in file formats and annotation structures across different sources poses substantial challenge for unified data processing. For datasets that lack explicit ground-truth labels, we employ Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking to extract and store the missing answers in the answer field, following the prompt in Prompt 12. To facilitate downstream processessuch as caption generation, reasoning distillation, and correctness evaluationand to enhance accessibility for the research community, we further convert all collected samples into unified canonical schema. Each standardized data entry includes the following fields: Metadata: source, id Raw Data: original question, original answer Input/Output: image, question, answer Augmented Annotations: qwen3vl 235b instruct caption, qwen3vl 235b thinking response Metrics: qwen3vl 4b pass rate, is consistent, consistency analysis The schema fields are defined as follows: source denotes the origin dataset (e.g., Geometry3K), while id serves as the unique sample identifier. The Raw Data fields preserve the original question and original answer exactly as obtained from the source, which are then processed into the standardized Input/Output triplet (image, question, and answer) used for training. Within the Augmented Annotations, qwen3vl 235b instruct caption and qwen3vl 235b thinking - response denote the dense visual description and reasoning steps generated by the teacher model, respectively. The Metrics group includes qwen3vl 4b pass rate, which serves as difficulty proxy based on smaller models performance, alongside is consistent and consistency analysis, which provide automated verification of the generated reasoning against the ground truth."

Specifically, to ensure high-quality and non-redundant reasoning traces, we apply multi-stage filtering procedure to the distilled outputs. Template and Length Validation: We first impose strict structural validation to ensure the usability of the distilled output. Specifically, we filter out any reasoning trace that fails to adhere to the mandated <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer> output template. Furthermore, to prevent the retention of superficial or trivial rationales, we enforce minimum length constraint, discarding traces that are shorter than 100 words. This stage removes approximately 1.2% of the data based on length and template constraints  (Table 6)  . The detailed statistics of the processed subsets are reported in Table 6. N-gram De-duplication: We detect and remove templated or overly repetitive CoTs using an n-gram overlap criterion. Concretely, we flag CoTs that contain any 50-gram that repeats at least 3 times (i.e., = 50, frequency threshold = 3). Flagged traces are either discarded or re-generated with different random seed to encourage diversity. Correctness Verification: For tasks that have ground-truth answers, we extract the final answer from the <answer> tag and compare it against the answer extracted in Section 3.1, the incorrect CoTs are discarded. The detailed verification protocol is provided in Prompt 15. This process eliminated roughly 20% of instances containing potential hallucinations or incorrect reasoning traces, the consistency ratios across different subsets are summarized in Figure 3. The detailed verification results are shown in Table 7. Following the above data selection pipeline, we obtain high-quality MMFineReason-1.8M dataset with totally 5.1B solution tokens. We further uniformly sample 40k instances from MMFineReason1.8M to construct an RL training subset, while the remaining data are reserved for SFT. Difficulty Filtering for Efficient Training. Given the massive scale of our curated data, training on the entire corpus is computationally suboptimal due to the prevalence of redundant or trivial samples. To address this, we employ difficulty-based filtering strategy [54]. Specifically, we perform inference on each question using Qwen3-VL-4B-Thinking, generating four independent responses. We discard any example where the model provides correct answer in at least one attempt (pass rate = 0). This conservative filtering criterion ensures that we retain only genuinely challenging problems where moderate-sized model fails consistently. By discarding samples that contribute negligible training 7 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods Figure 4: Dataset composition of MMFineReason-1.8M.

Specifically, we derive two challenging subsets from the full MMFineReason-1.8M corpus: MMFineReason-123K and MMFineReason-586K, by retaining samples with pass rate = 0 and pass rate = 1, respectively, which are well suited for efficient SFT and ablation studies. detailed analysis of the difficulty score distribution is presented in Section 4.2."

Bubble size and color intensity denote the proportion of samples at specific pass rate level.

Conversely, puzzle and game-based datasets like GameQA-140K, Raven, and VisualSphinx demonstrate the lowest pass rates.

By generating detailed descriptions and categorizing the images based on their semantic content, we provide fine-grained analysis of the visual distribution. Visual Content Analysis. Recent studies [51, 49] demonstrate that detailed image captioning significantly enhances multimodal reasoning capabilities. Building on this insight, we leverage the powerful Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking model to generate structured, high-fidelity captions for the entire MMFineReason dataset. As shown in Figure 6c and Table 1, MMFineReason provides significantly denser semantic information, averaging 609 tokens per captionmore than double the length of HoneyBee [4] (299 tokens). Crucially, distinct from HoneyBee which only incorporates captions for subset of its samples (approx. 58%), MMFineReason guarantees 100% caption coverage for all image-question pairs. This comprehensive coverage ensures that every reasoning chain is explicitly supported by fine-grained visual details, providing more consistent and robust foundation for multimodal learning than baselines with partial visual context.

Reasoning Depth Comparison to Other Datasets. We quantify reasoning depth by analyzing the CoT token length distributions using the Qwen3-VL tokenizer (Figure 6b and Table 1). MMFineReason exhibits substantially more elaborate reasoning process than existing baselines, achieving an average CoT length of 2,910 tokensapproximately 2.7 longer than HoneyBee (1, 063) and 4.3 longer than OpenMMReasoner (675). Notably, the median token count of MMFineReason (2, 038) is nearly 2.1 that of HoneyBee (972) and over 11.3 that of OpenMMReasoner (180). This disparity indicates that while baselines often provide concise or superficial rationales, MMFineReason consistently delivers extensive, step-by-step derivations. Furthermore, the extended tail of our distribution (Max: 16, 316) underscores the datasets capacity to handle highly complex, multi-stage reasoning tasks requiring deep cognitive traversal. Token Length Distribution of MMFineReason. To evaluate the structural quality and domain adaptability of MMFineReason, we analyze the token length distribution and reasoning density across four curated domains. Using the Qwen3-VL tokenizer on the generated responses (qwen3vl 235b - thinking response), we observe distinct characteristics (visualized in Figure 6a): Puzzle & Game: This domain exhibits the highest average length (4, 810 tokens), reflecting the most intensive reasoning requirements. The distribution is driven by the necessity for rigorous visual-spatial verification. In tasks such as Raven (avg. 7, 745 tokens) and VisualSphinx (avg. 6, 833 tokens), the model must explicitly hypothesize rules and verify candidate options 11 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods sequentially, resulting in dense System-2 reasoning traces that significantly exceed those of other domains. Mathematics: The Mathematics domain demonstrates high information density with an average length of 2, 950 tokens. Distinguished by exceptional symbolic rigor, this category exhibits density of LaTeX markers more than double that of scientific tasks. The structure is distinct from natural language tasks, heavily populated with step-by-step symbolic derivations (e.g., Euclid30K, Geo170k) essential for precise calculation. Science: Averaging 2, 305 tokens across 245k samples, this domain bridges abstract logic and real-world context. The data reflects dual process: the model must ground visual entities (Perception) before applying domain-specific knowledge (Causal Inference). The result is balanced reasoning structure combining substantial textual explanation with moderate symbolic usage. General/OCR: Serving as regularization baseline, this category remains concise (avg. 1, 262 tokens). Primarily derived from LLaVA-CoT, these samples prioritize direct visual grounding over complex logical deduction. This preserves the models System-1 perception capabilities, mitigating reasoning hallucinationthe tendency to over-generate complex rationales for simple perceptual tasks."

SFT Drives Major Gains in Reasoning. For mathematical and logical reasoning, the largest performance improvements come from SFT.

While RL improves DynaMath across all scales, it causes slight drops on MathVision for 4B and 8B models.

As illustrated in Figure 7, our approach demonstrates superior scaling properties across data volume, data quality, and model capacity. Superior Data Quality and Peak Performance. We first examine the impact of data quality by comparing models trained on full datasets under the same parameter scale (8B). MMFineReason-1.8M achieves peak score of 75.7, establishing substantial lead over existing open-source datasets such as MMR1-1.6M (67.4) and HoneyBee-2.5M (65.1). Despite utilizing smaller sample size than HoneyBee (1.8M vs. 2.5M), our model achieves performance gain of +10.6 points. This significant gap highlights that the fine-grained reasoning logic in our dataset provides much denser supervision signals than standard caption-based or coarse-reasoning datasets. Extreme Data Efficiency. Beyond peak performance, MMFineReason exhibits remarkable efficiency in low-data regimes. The most striking finding is that our minimal subset, MMFineReason-123K, already achieves score of 73.3. This result significantly outperforms models trained on the full 15 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods Figure 8: Ablation studies on data and training strategies. Left: caption augmentation brings marginal or negative gains on STEM benchmarks, likely redundant with visual cues in long CoT. Right: ultrahigh resolution (20482) shows diminishing returns over 7682/2562 for geometry and chart tasks, though still beneficial for natural images (RWQA). HoneyBee (2.5M) and MMR1 (1.6M) datasets. By utilizing only 5% of the data volume of comparable benchmarks, MMFineReason matches or exceeds their performance. This cross-over effect suggests that rigorous filtering and high-quality rationale construction effectively eliminate the redundancy found in large-scale datasets, allowing for faster convergence with fraction of the computational budget. SOTA Comparison and Parameter Efficiency. Finally, we benchmark our models against leading open-weights and commercial baselines (represented by dashed lines in Figure 7). Our high-quality data enables smaller models to punch above their weight class. Specifically, our 4B model achieves score of 73.9, surpassing the widely-used Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking (72.5), which demonstrates that superior data quality can effectively compensate for 2 reduction in model parameters. Scaling up to 8B parameters, our model establishes new state-of-the-art for its size class with score of 75.7. It not only outperforms the significantly larger Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking (74.5) but also exceeds the performance of the commercial baseline Gemini-2.5-Flash (75.0).

            "content": "To validate the effectiveness of our proposed data strategy and training settings, we conduct two sets of ablation studies to investigate the impact of caption augmentation strategies and input resolution on model performance. Trade-off of Caption Augmentation. Figure 8 (left) presents the effects of introducing caption augmentation (CapAug), specifically by prepending image captions enclosed within <caption>...</caption> tags to the response. The experiments reveal clear trade-off in model performance. Specifically, CapAug slightly boosts logical reasoning capabilities, with LogicVista improving by 1.1%. This can likely be attributed to captions forcing the model to parse the layout and complete information of images, facilitating better understanding of structure and logical relationships. However, on STEM visual reasoning tasks like MathVista and MathVision, it does not bring significant performance 16 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods Figure 9: Performance landscape of distilled sub-datasets. gains. This is likely because the Long CoT already contains sufficient visual information required for reasoning, rendering the caption information redundant. Consequently, we do not adopt CapAug in our final version. Scaling Effect of Input Resolution. The analysis of input resolution (Max Pixels) in Figure 8 (right) shows that simply increasing resolution does not always yield performance gains. Surprisingly, ultra-high resolution (20482) does not outperform medium-to-low resolution settings on multiple benchmarks. For example, on MathVista and CharXiv, the performance of 7682 or even 2562 is superior to that of 20482. Although 20482 achieves slight advantage on MathVision, the overall benefit is limited considering the significantly increased computational cost. This phenomenon suggests that: (1) the core features of many current benchmark problems (especially geometry and charts) do not rely on pixel-level ultra-high definition; and (2) excessive resolution results in overly long visual token sequences, introducing redundancy and increasing the difficulty for the attention mechanism to capture key features. However, notable exception is observed on RealWorldQA, which focuses on general natural images. On this benchmark, scaling up to 20482 yields stable performance gains. This is likely because real-world scenarios often contain fine-grained details, small objects, or dense text embedded in complex backgrounds, which necessitate higher pixel density for precise recognition. In contrast to the sparse and structural nature of diagrams, natural images require high resolution to resolve these subtle visual cues effectively. Balancing performance across domains and computational efficiency, we adopt 7682 as our default setting."

Across all subsets, 17 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods we observe the following key findings. Diminishing Returns of Scale and the Pareto Frontier. By juxtaposing MMR1 (N 1.5M) with ViRL39K (N 39K), we observe significant non-linear relationship between data volume and reasoning performance. While MMR1 establishes the upper bound with 73.60% accuracy, ViRL39K achieves 72.79% accuracyretaining 98.9% of the relative performance using only 2.4% of the data volume. This constructs new Pareto frontier, indicating that systematically cleaned, reformatted, and verified data (as seen in ViRL39K) can drastically reduce training costs. It further suggests that blind data scaling encounters severe diminishing returns beyond certain threshold in multimodal reasoning tasks. Latent Capability Activation via High-Density Instruction. The most significant outlier in our scaling analysis is WeMath2.0-SFT. Despite comprising negligible 0.05% of the total data volume (N = 814), it achieves reasoning accuracy of 70.98%, effectively matching the performance of datasets three orders of magnitude larger, such as MMR1 (73.60%). This disproportionate efficiency validates the Knowledge-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (KO-CoT) paradigm. We hypothesize that large-scale pre-training endows models with latent domain knowledge, but often leaves them without the specific reasoning syntax required for complex problem-solving. WeMath2.0-SFT functions not as knowledge source, but as high-efficiency catalyst, aligning the models internal representations with structured reasoning paths. This suggests that for foundation models, small set of high-quality, reasoningdense instructions is sufficient to trigger capabilities that otherwise remain dormant in massive, noisy corpora. Not all hard reasoning transfers: puzzle/game datasets lag. Puzzle/game-centric datasets are consistently weaker: GameQA-140K (122.9K, 67.67), Raven (20.3K, 68.08), and PuzzleQA (2.0K, 68.82). Despite their rigorous generation/verification (e.g., engine-derived annotations in GameQA-140K), these tasks emphasize planning-like search, symbolic state transitions, and abstract relational rules that may be mismatched with the dominant evaluation distribution (often math/science QA). Another plausible factor is that many puzzle/game solutions resemble program-execution traces; if the target model is not explicitly trained to internalize algorithmic state updates, these examples contribute less to general multimodal QA performance. Geometry-only corpora underperform, indicating narrow visual grammars. Geo3K (9.0K, 66.38) and Geo170K (11.8K, 67.02) are among the lowest performers, despite being in-domain for diagram reasoning. This highlights critical nuance: geometry datasets can be structurally narrow (limited diagram styles, repetitive constructions, constrained linguistic patterns), which reduces their marginal utility for broad reasoning. Euclid30K performs substantially better (26.7K, 70.79), supporting the hypothesis that formalized reasoning structure and better-designed problem diversity (plane/solid geometry, proof-like steps) are more important than simply adding more geometry instances. Impact of Disciplinary Breadth on Generalization. Comparing GameQA-140K (67.67%) and BMMR (72.94%) highlights the importance of disciplinary diversity in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data. Although GameQA offers larger volume of samples (140K), its scope is restricted to closed-world game logic. BMMR, despite being smaller (80K), spans over 300 academic disciplines. This breadth allows the model to internalize more generalized reasoning structure, suggesting that for general-purpose vision-language models, diversity in the reasoning domain is stronger driver of performance than the depth of any single task type. 18 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods"

            "content": "In this work, we view multimodal reasoning primarily as data-centric problem rather than purely model-centric one. MMFineReason shows that strong multimodal reasoning capabilities can be systematically induced through structured data design, without relying on excessive model scaling or proprietary supervision. Beyond the dataset itself, this study establishes scalable framework for reasoning data engineering, covering reasoning supervision, difficulty-aware structuring, and data composition. Results across multiple model scales demonstrate that well-curated reasoning data can deliver substantial performance gains and parameter efficiency, enabling smaller open models to compete with much larger reasoning-oriented systems. Moreover, our findings indicate that reasoningoriented supervision functions as general capability amplifier, benefiting both complex reasoning tasks and broader multimodal understanding. MMFineReason therefore serves as both benchmark resource and reproducible methodology for building open, efficient multimodal reasoning systems. 19 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods References [1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al.

We exclude the following categories of data from our collection: Multi-image samples: Data where each instance contains more than one image. Overly simple task data: e.g., CLEVR family and geo170k (align), which provide limited reasoning complexity. Highly specialized imaging domains: e.g., PathVQA, which focuses on medical imagery. Multilingual datasets featuring minor languages within images: e.g., EXAMS-V. A.3 Filteration Details To ensure the high quality and robustness of our training data, we implemented multi-stage data processing pipeline, consisting of basic structural cleaning and advanced quality assessment. The statistics for these processes are summarized in Table 6 and Table 7. Basic Data Cleaning. As shown in Table 6, we first applied rigorous filtering based on sequence length and template validity.The Filt. (Len) step removed samples that exceeded the context window limits or were anomalously short, while the Filt. (Tem) step discarded samples with parsing errors or malformed templates.Overall, the raw datasets exhibited high structural integrity, with retention rates exceeding 95% for most subsets. notably, while large-scale datasets like MMR1 contained higher absolute number of template errors (75,585), the relative loss remained minimal (< 5%).Some specific domains, such as VisualSphinx and Geometry3k, showed slightly lower retention rates ( 92 93%), primarily due to complex formatting requirements inherent to their tasks. 24 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods Table 6: Data Cleaning Statistics by Dataset.

Following structural cleaning, we evaluated the semantic quality of the remaining data using Pass Rate (PR) metric and consistency check, as detailed in Table 7. The Pass Rate serves as an indicator of sample clarity or model competence, where higher rate implies that the model successfully processed the sample. We observed clear positive correlation between the Pass Rate and the Consistency Rate: High-Consistency Datasets: Datasets such as ScienceQA and the massive MMR1 demonstrated exceptional quality, with consistency rates of 96.18% and 97.30% respectively, and correspondingly high mean Pass Rates ( 0.8 0.9). This suggests these samples are well-posed and have clear ground truths. Challenging Scenarios: In contrast, abstract reasoning tasks like Raven and VisualSphinx exhibited low mean Pass Rates (< 0.25) and low consistency (< 40%). This disparity highlights the inherent difficulty of these tasks or the presence of ambiguous samples that necessitate more robust filtering strategies. Ultimately, we identified approximately 1.81 million consistent samples (Total Consistent) out of the processed pool, providing solid foundation for stable model training."

For evaluation metrics, we replace traditional exact string matching with the compass-verifier [24], which employs an LLM-as-a-Judge to accurately assess response correctness. Regarding rollout settings, following the guidelines from OpenDataArena [5] and the official Qwen documentation, we set the temperature to 0.0, top-p to 1.0, and top-k to 1.

Your primary mission is to deconstruct multimodal tasks (consisting of images and text) and translate them into highly structured and comprehensive natural language description. The goal is to create golden reference text that is as unambiguous and detailed as data file, which will be used to evaluate the accuracy of other AI models. Your adherence to the format described below is critical. You will be provided with task that consists of up to two parts: one image, and its corresponding question text. Guiding Principles for Analysis: 1. Category-First, Structure-Always: Your entire analysis begins with correctly identifying the images category. The category list now includes both STEM-style images and natural photographs (see expanded list below). This category dictates the focus of your description. You must then follow the specified markdown structure precisely for your output. 2. Separate What is Seen from What is Inferred: Your description must maintain strict separation between elements explicitly visible in the image and properties inferred from the accompanying 31 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods text. The output format has dedicated sections for this. 3. Comprehensive and Atomic Breakdown: Every single element in the image must be described individually within the Explicit Component Breakdown section. For natural images, this includes: People (pose, clothing, objects held) Everyday objects Scene elements (furniture, roads, sky, vehicles) Background structures Animals, plants, food, tools, etc. Treat each as standalone component. 4. Holistic Synthesis: The image and question text are single unit. Use the text to define roles, identify actions, or extract inferred properties. Instructions for Structuring Your Output You must generate single text block. The response must be structured using markdown with headings, bolded keywords, and bullet points exactly as specified below. For each image provided, create complete descriptive block starting with: ### Image [N]: [Primary Category Name] Required Output Structure: Heading. ### Image [N]: [Primary Category Name] (replace [N] with the image number, and [Primary Category Name] with the category you identify from the list below). Scene Summary. single, concise sentence that describes the overall purpose and content of the image. Explicit Component Breakdown. (This section is for visible elements only.) [Component Name] ([label]): description of the component. The [label] should be the exact text or symbol labeling the component in the image. If there is no label, use None. Repeat for every single visible component: objects, vectors, surfaces, axes, points, everyday objects, people, clothing, background structures, etc. Interactions and Relationships. (This section describes how the explicit components are connected and arranged.) Describe spatial and structural connections (e.g., Person stands next to table B, Button triggers Modal B). Describe logical or physical relationships (e.g., contact, holding, containment, occlusion). Trace directional flows (arrows/process steps) or describe data trends (charts/graphs).

Solve the problem efficiently and clearly by integrating all information from multimodal inputs. Core Principles 33 MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods 1. Equal Weight to All Inputs. Information from images (photos, charts, graphs, diagrams, tables, handwritten notes) is as important as text. Never ignore visual elements. 2. Systematic Analysis. Follow rigorous, reproducible approach for every problem. 3. Precision and Accuracy. Double-check all calculations and reasoning steps. 4. Adaptive Reasoning. Choose the most appropriate method based on the specific problem context. Solution Framework Phase 1: Comprehensive Information Extraction Carefully analyze all text content for requirements, constraints, and given values. Thoroughly examine all visual elements, extracting every piece of relevant information. Note measurements, relationships, patterns, and any implicit information. Explicitly connect visual and textual information when they relate to each other. Phase 2: Strategic Problem Setup Compile all extracted information in an organized manner. Clearly state what needs to be found or proven. Identify the most relevant scientific principles and methodologies. Consider what assumptions may be necessary and state them explicitly. Phase 3: Rigorous Solution Execution Present your solution with complete logical flow. Show all mathematical steps with proper notation. When using formulas, present them clearly, substitute values, and then calculate. Reference specific parts of visual inputs when they support your reasoning. Maintain unit consistency throughout all calculations. Keep appropriate precision and significant figures. Phase 4: Solution Validation Verify your answer makes scientific and logical sense. Check that all parts of the question have been addressed. For multiple choice questions, confirm your selection and briefly justify if needed. Ensure dimensional analysis is correct. Key Reminders Visual information is never supplementary it is integral to the solution. Every piece of data from images must be considered. Your reasoning should be so clear that someone could follow it without seeing the images. When in doubt, show more work rather than less. Connect each step logically to build complete solution narrative. Answer Format Guidelines Determine the nature of your answer: If the problem has definitive, fixed answer (numerical value, specific choice, exact result): Present your complete reasoning and solution process. MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods At the end, clearly state: Therefore, the final answer is <answer>YOUR ANSWER</answer> (with the actual answer substituted for YOUR ANSWER). Examples: <answer>5.2 m/s</answer>, <answer>C</answer>, <answer>2.5 m, 30</answer>. If the problem requires explanation, discussion, or has no single fixed answer: Focus on presenting your points clearly and in structured manner. Provide full analysis and explanation. You may include examples, reasoning steps, or possible conclusions, but single correct answer wrapped with <answer> tags is not required. Problem injection The problem will be inserted as: Problem: {item[question]} Analyze all provided materials carefully, think through the problem step by step, and provide comprehensive solution that demonstrates mastery of both scientific reasoning and visual analysis.
