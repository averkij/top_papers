Crucially, it empowers these models to generalize beyond their original training objectives via in-context learning, allowing them to adapt to novel problems without the need for task-specific parameter updates. This distinct capability highlights their utility as versatile, general-purpose computational systems. Model evaluation is crucial part of research and deployment. Most evaluation resources are in English, hindering model development for lowresource languages such as Finnish. We have tried to mitigate this challenge by introducing the first medium-scale effort for generative model evaluation with the original FIN-bench (Luukkonen et al., 2023). Finnish has also been included in EuroEval (Nielsen et al., 2024), MMTEB (Enevoldsen et al., 2025), and GlotEval (Luo et al., 2025). However, these resources have their drawbacks: Data quality. Datasets quality for benchmarking different-sized models is not assessed, which may delimit large proportion of tasks (Kydlíˇcek et al., 2024), or samples are produced with machine translation without human review. Task formulation. Task formulations are simple and do not account for prompt sensitivity (Voronov et al., 2024), and are poorly compatible with non-instruction-tuned model evaluation (Gu et al., 2025). Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved into central focus of modern artificial intelligence research, driving substantial progress in natural language understanding and generation. Originating from the Transformer model architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), these models with billions of trainable parameters are typically trained on unprecedentedly large textual datasets. This extensive training enables them to We present FIN-bench-v2, broad collection of Finnish benchmark datasets compiled into unified evaluation suite. We systematically evaluate the quality of benchmark datasets using various metrics, create diverse collection of prompts by hand across all datasets with multiple human annotators, and manually refine the machine-translated GoldenSwag and XED datasets for accurate representation. We release FIN-bench-v2, compatible 1 with the widely used Language Model Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2024)."

            "title": "2 Objectives for FIN-bench-v2",
            "content": "Our main objectives for FIN-bench-v2 were modernizing the previous version of FIN-bench into long-term-maintainable, easy-to-use format and expanding the benchmark to be more extensive and reliable for the evaluation of models of different sizes. The original FIN-bench (Luukkonen et al., 2023) covered broad, though not comprehensive, range of tasks for evaluating the Finnish language capabilities of LLMs. However, the evaluation libraries on which it relied had become deprecated, making it difficult to use in 2025. We therefore first modernized and ported FIN-bench to work on the LM Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2024), converting its datasets into the native format supported by the HuggingFace Datasets library to ensure longterm maintainability and ease of use. This modernization effort later evolved into FIN-bench-v2, broader initiative to expand and diversify the benchmarks task coverage. In particular, we sought to introduce new tasks from variety of domains, including mathematics, geography, and medicine, to make the suite as comprehensive and representative as possible. Beyond standard post-training assessment, we designed the suite to facilitate intermediate feedback during the pre-training phase via model checkpoint evaluation. To accommodate the distinct behaviors of base and fine-tuned models, we sought to implement two separate prompting strategies: Cloze Formulation (CF) and Multiple-choice Formulation (MCF) (Gu et al., 2025). This dual approach addresses established findings that while instruction-tuned models benefit from answer choices embedded in the prompt (MCF), base models typically demonstrate superior performance with standard cloze-style completions (Brown et al., 2020)."

            "content": "FIN-bench-v2 The first step of the benchmark creation was to include all tasks and datasets from the original FINbench (Luukkonen et al., 2023). As will be discussed in the following section, each of these tasks and datasets was systematically re-evaluated to determine whether it should be retained, modified, or excluded in the construction of FIN-bench-v2. This reassessment ensured that the updated benchmark remained reliable, relevant, and compatible with our renewed evaluation framework. To further broaden the scope of FIN-bench-v2 and include new tasks and datasets across variety of domains, we investigated wide range of existing datasets as potential candidates. While some of these datasets were already familiar to us through prior experiments and were known to meet our quality standards, others required closer inspection and additional processing. Our final pool of candidate tasks included: ARC Challenge (Clark et al., 2018), Belebele (Bandarkar et al., 2024), GoldenSwag (Chizhov et al., 2025), ScandiSent (Isbister et al., 2021), SIB-200 (Adelani et al., 2023), SQuAD v2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), ScaLA (Nielsen, 2023), XL-Sum (Hasan et al., 2021), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and all tasks from the original FIN-bench: analogies, arithmetic, cause and effect, emotions, empirical judgments, general knowledge, HHH alignment, intent recognition, paraphrase, misconceptions, sentence ambiguity, and similarities abstraction. We utilized Finnish-language versions of established benchmarks sourced from third-party repositories. For the ARC Challenge task, we employed the human-translated dataset developed by Bijl de Vroe et al. (2025). Conversely, machine-translated versions of GoldenSwag, GSM8K, MMLU, and TruthfulQA were obtained from LumiOpen (2025). For some datasets, additional refinement was necessary to ensure quality and consistency. In particular, we manually annotated the machine-translated GoldenSwag dataset to correct or remove erroneous samples, and we expanded the emotions task from the original FIN-bench to include 1,000 samples derived from the XED dataset, from which the original task was created Öhman et al. (2020). Annotation guidelines for GoldenSwag and XED can be found at Appendix A.8 and Appendix A.9, respectively. We used machine-translated versions of XL-sum and SQuAD (Nuutinen et al., 2025). All datasets used in FIN-bench-v2 are converted and migrated from their original format and sources to individual repositories in our HuggingFace organization page.1 If an original dataset was not in format natively supported by the HuggingFace Datasets library, we converted it to the same for1https://huggingface.co/TurkuNLP 2 mat used for converting the original FIN-bench suite. For both CF and MCF prompts, we have followed the example established in Mikhailov et al. (2025) and Oepen et al. (2025), creating five separate variants of the prompts, roughly retaining the same meaning but with different wording. Three people participated in this task, each following multiprompt writing guidelines (Appendix A.7) created specifically for use in FIN-bench-v2 to ensure cohesiveness across all prompts. This practice allows prompt sensitivity and the effect of different user formulations to be determined."

            "content": "To ensure evaluation tasks are stable and offer clear signal regarding performance shifts during training, this section introduces four metrics derived from the Finetasks framework (Kydlíˇcek et al., 2024): Monotonicity (using Spearmans ρ), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Non-Random Performance, and Model Ordering Consistency help distinguish between tasks that show stable, progressive learning (high-quality signal) and those that exhibit volatile or inconsistent behavior (high noise). 2https://huggingface.co/MultiSynt/ nemotron-cc-finnish-tower9b 4.2.1 Monotonicity Index The Monotonicity Index quantifies the extent to which models performance on specific task consistently improves (or remains stable) as training progresses. This is crucial because effective training should lead to non-decreasing, positive trend in performance metrics. To capture monotonicity without assuming strictly linear relationship between the training step (e.g., number of iterations or tokens processed) and the score, the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (ρ) is employed: ρ = 1 6 (cid:80) d2 n(n2 1) where di is the difference between the ranks of the i-th observation (di = Rstep,i Rscore,i) and is the number of paired observations (checkpoints). The resulting ρ value ranges from 1 to +1 where ρ = +1 is perfect positive monotonic relationship (the score consistently increases with every training step), ρ = 0 means there is no correlation (scores fluctuate randomly with respect to the training progression), and ρ = 1 is perfect negative monotonic relationship (the score consistently decreases with training steps). In the context of LLM training, task is considered reliable and stable if it maintains an average correlation of ρ 0.5 across multiple training runs, indicating clear, positive learning trend is generally present (Kydlíˇcek et al., 2024)."

The resulting SNRAgg provides robust, single-point measure of overall task stability. positive final score indicates that the signal-tonoise performance ratio is, across the prompt population, statistically greater than the required threshold (SNRreq). This implies the system exhibits robust performance, where the signal (median performance) significantly outweighs the noise (variability across runs) relative to the task baseline. negative or zero final score indicates that the robustness is insufficient to meet the required threshold. This suggests performance instability, where the variability across experimental runs is high enough, relative to the signal, to prevent the system from confidently exceeding the tasks performance baseline at the designated statistical confidence level."

Empirical Maximum (MT ) represents the highest performance score achieved on Task across the entire observation window, considering all available sequential training checkpoints and all evaluated models/datasets.

For multiple-choice questions with options, BT is computed as the sum of 1 across all samples. For generative evalNchoices uations requiring exact matches, the baseline is defined as BT = 0. The operation max(0, . . .) ensures that tasks where the empirical maximum score does not exceed the stochastic threshold are assigned an NRC of zero, correctly reflecting an absence of acquired non-random capability. Tasks with high positive NRC provide strong signal above the noise floor, confirming that model learning is actively occurring and that the task is suitable for differentiating the efficacy of earlystage pre-training curricula. Tasks with an NRC of zero are deemed inappropriate for making model selection decisions based on early checkpoints, as the performance achieved remains within the statistical margin of random chance. 4.2.5 Final Metric for Task Selection For the final selection, we check if the task meets all the described criteria, i.e., ρ 0.5, SNRAgg > 0, NRC 0, and τ -Consistency 0.7."

            "title": "5.1 Evaluation Strategy",
            "content": "We report performance metrics for two distinct model groups: the purpose-trained decoder-only models introduced in Subsection 4.1 and larger (> 10B) openly available LLMs. The tasks within the benchmark are categorized based on their output modality, which the LM Evaluation Harness refers to as the output type. This categorization yields two primary task types: Multiple-choice: The model is required to identify the correct continuation to given prompt by computing the conditional likelihood of predefined set of options. For multiple-choice tasks, we report the normalized accuracy score. The only exception is the TruthfulQA MC2 task, which returns separate metric commonly referred to as the MC2 accuracy. Generative: The model produces free-form text output, which is subsequently evaluated by comparison against set of reference answers. These tasks return several different metrics, which we make selection based on the use case. 5.2 Criteria Assessment Using Purpose-trained Models We evaluated the entire pool of candidate tasks to determine if they fulfill the inclusion criteria in FINbench-v2. The evaluation methodology involved the following two main configurations: Multiple-choice tasks were evaluated under kshot run configurations, where {0, 1, 5}. Generative (generate_until) tasks were run in zero-shot (k = 0) configuration. During criteria assessment, we choose single metric from task to compare across all prompts and models. Our evaluation using the purpose-trained models resulted in several different insights. First, the English Nemotron-CC model used as control model functioned as expected, demonstrating negligible performance on our tasks. Second, the MultiSynt model, which trained exclusively on synthetic data translated from Nemotron-CC high-quality English samples, consistently outperformed models trained on human-authored data. This result may be influenced by the evaluation setup itself, while most of examined tasks are translated, they likely share specific stylistic features and artifacts with the MultiSynt training data. This can artificially inflate performance, favoring models trained on translated content over those trained on actual Finnish data (Wu et al., 2025). Following the initial zero-shot evaluation, substantial number of candidate tasks failed to meet the our criteria, of which reference performance plot can be seen in Figure 1. As remedial measure to stabilize underperforming tasks, k-shot configuration was utilized, sequentially increasing the provided context from 0 to 1 to 5 examples. However, this only resulted in marginal performance gains (approximately +5%), and was insufficient to rectify the issues in these tasks, ultimately leading to the exclusion of the tasks from the benchmark suite. These tasks were ScaLA, XL-sum, GSM8K, MMLU, and several tasks in the original FIN-bench suite (arithmetic, cause and effect, empirical judgments, intent recognition, misconceptions, sentence ambiguity). For more information, the focus was shifted to running evaluations on the larger openly available models. We limit the model options to only include instruction tuned models to test the effectiveness of MCF prompts. The chosen models were Googles instruction-tuned Gemma 3 27B (Gemma Team et al., 2025), Metas instruction-tuned Llama 4 Scout 17B 16E 3, and two models from LumiOpen: Llama Poro 2 70B Instruct (Zosa et al., 2025) and LumiOpen Poro 34B Chat (Luukkonen et al., 2025). As the resource usage is significantly higher on these models, we limited the runs to only include tasks on {0, 1} k-shot configurations. 5.3.1 Detailed Evaluation of Multiple-Choice Tasks The zero-shot results for multiple-choice tasks (Figure 3) establish Gemma 3 27B as the most robust performer across the suite. It achieves the highest or near-highest scores in diverse categories, including ARC Challenge, FIN-bench general knowledge, and TruthfulQA. Llama 4 Scout and Llama Poro 2 70B occupy competitive second tier, though they exhibit distinct formulation preferences; the dense Poro 70B model often performs exceptionally well in Cloze Formulation (CF) but exhibits volatility when answer options are presented (MCF), whereas the Scout MoE model typically benefits from the visible options in MCF. Poro 34B Chat consistently trailed the other models across most tasks. Please refer to Appendix A.3 for both {0, 1}-shot performance plots and model-specific performance plots. Task-specific analysis reveals notable differences in formulation sensitivity. While the generalist models (Gemma and Scout) demonstrated the expected behavior of improved performance in MCFfor example, Gemmas normalized accuracy in ARC Challenge rose from 0.57 (CF) to 0.70 (MCF)the Poro family frequently experienced performance degradation in the multiple-choice format. For instance, in FIN-bench analogies, Poro 34B dropped from 0.87 (CF) to 0.53 (MCF), suggesting these models may treat option lists as noise rather than helpful constraints. Finally, certain tasks proved formulation-invariant: ScandiSent results hit ceiling with all models scoring above 0.92 regardless of format, while GoldenSwag presented universal failure case where MCF scores collapsed to near-random chance across all modFigure 1: Prompt average normalized accuracy performance of the empirical judgments task (CF) in the original FIN-bench across all 5 purpose-trained models. This is an example of task where 3 out of 4 criteria were failed in both CF and MCF prompts (monotonicity, low noise, ordering consistency). The dotted line indicates the base score, which can be calculated by dividing the number of correct answers by the number of all answer options.

The task passed all four criteria (monotonicity, low noise, non-randomness, ordering consistency) in both CF and MCF prompts. please refer to the average performance plots for all tasks and k-shot configurations in Appendix A.2, and Appendix A.6 for tables showing the results of the criteria assessment. Conversely, for tasks that demonstrated robust signal, we adopted an inclusive selection strategy: if any single prompt formulation satisfied the criteria, all formulations for that task were retained. An example of validated task meeting these stability thresholds is presented in Figure 2. The final list of all tasks chosen to be included in FIN-bench-v2 can be found in Table 1."

This pattern is visible, for example, in ARC Challenge, FIN-bench Emotions, and FINbench General Knowledge, where three of the four models show clear CFMCF gap in favour of MCF.

GoldenSwag stands out as an exception in the zero-shot setting. For all four models, CF scores clearly exceed 0.60, whereas the corresponding MCF scores remain close to the random baseline.

These observations indicate that the relative behaviour of CF and MCF depends jointly on the task, the model, and the evaluation setup, with some combinations behaving as expected from prior work and others diverging notably from it. 8 Table 1: Final task list of FIN-bench-v2 Task name Text in samples Task type Task category Variants E ARC Challenge HT Belebele HT GoldenSwag MT&HR TruthfulQA MT ScandiSent SQuAD SIB-200 FIN-bench: analogies FIN-bench: emotions_1k HW MT HT MT&HR MT&HR FIN-bench: general_knowledge MT&HR FIN-bench: hhh_alignment MT&HR FIN-bench: similarities_ abstraction MT&HR comMultiple-choice question answering Multiple-choice question answering Sentence pletion Multiple-choice question answering Multiple-choice classification Generative question answering Multiple-choice classification Multiple-choice question answering Multiple-choice question answering Multiple-choice question answering Multiple-choice question answering Multiple-choice question answering World edge knowlCF+MCF Machine reading comprehension CF+MCF - - - - - - Commonsense reasoning Truthfulness CF+MCF - CF+Gen - - - Sentiment analysis Machine reading comprehension Text tion Relational soning classificareaCF+MCF - - Gen - - CF+MCF CF+MCF Sentiment analysis CF+MCF"

            "content": "In this work, we introduced FIN-bench-v2, modernized and substantially extended benchmark suite for evaluating large language models in Finnish. Building on the original FIN-bench, we migrated all retained tasks to the LM Evaluation Harness, converted datasets to the HuggingFace Datasets format, and unified diverse set of Finnish benchmarks under single, consistent framework. The suite covers multiple-choice and generative tasks spanning reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, sentiment analysis, world knowledge, and alignment, with both cloze and multiple-choice formulations and large set of manually designed prompt variants to explicitly account for prompt sensitivity. FIN-bench-v2 is publicly available in our fork of the LM Evaluation Harness at https://github.com/LumiOpen/ lm-evaluation-harness. In addition to the finished evaluation suite, we release the configuration files for excluded tasks, scripts related to our work and instructions on running the benchmark 9 suite on separate GitHub repository at https: //github.com/TurkuNLP/FIN-bench-v2. only models, where the training data provenance is strictly controlled. Our task selection methodology relies on pretraining five 2.15B-parameter decoder-only models on different corpora and using their learning dynamics to assess the quality of candidate tasks. We quantified monotonicity, signal-to-noise ratio, non-random performance, and model ordering consistency, and used these metrics to retain only tasks that provide stable and informative evaluation signal. This process led to the exclusion of several widely used benchmarks in their Finnish form, as they failed to yield reliable trends at this scale or under our experimental setup. We then evaluated set of larger instruction-tuned models on the selected tasks, characterizing how performance varies across tasks, domains, and prompt formulations, and highlighting cases where multiple-choice prompts or few-shot context materially change model behaviour. FIN-bench-v2 is intended as long-term resource for both model development and monitoring. Future work will focus on expanding the suite to cover additional domains and task types, with particular emphasis on more challenging generative evaluation and domain-specific benchmarks for areas such as medicine, law, and safety-critical reasoning. We also plan to further refine and reannotate existing datasets to improve translation quality, grammatical correctness, and label consistency, and to strengthen our contamination analysis as new Finnish pretraining corpora emerge. All datasets, prompts, and evaluation configurations are publicly released, and we hope that the community will build on FIN-bench-v2 to develop more capable and robust Finnish language models."

            "title": "Data Contamination and Memorization",
            "content": "A primary concern in evaluating large language models is data contaminationthe possibility that test sets were included in the models pre-training corpora. Because many of the evaluated models (e.g., Gemma, Llama 3) are trained on undisclosed portions of the internet, it is impossible to guarantee that they have not seen the source datasets prior to evaluation. Consequently, high performance may partially reflect memorization rather than genuine reasoning capabilities. This issue is particularly pertinent for the larger, open-weight models compared to our purpose-trained decoderPrompt Sensitivity and Brittleness LLMs are known to exhibit sensitivity to prompt formulation, where semantically equivalent instructions can yield significantly divergent performance metrics. model might fail task simply due to the specific phrasing of the instruction rather than lack of knowledge. To mitigate this \"prompt brittleness\", we did not rely on single prompt template; instead, we evaluated each task using five distinct, slightly reworded prompts. We report the performance averaged across these variations to provide more stable estimate of model capability, though we acknowledge that this does not fully eliminate the confounding variable of prompt engineering. Cultural and Linguistic Bias Although we utilized high-quality human and machine translations, the underlying logic and knowledge base of benchmarks like ARC and GoldenSwag remain rooted in Anglocentric cultural norms. Translating dataset linguistically does not necessarily adapt the cultural context or the \"common sense\" assumptions inherent in the questions. Therefore, the benchmark may penalize models that are culturally aligned with Finland but lack specific knowledge of US-centric history, law, or social norms present in the source datasets."

For FinBench v2 we use machinetranslated and manually corrected Finnish subset from our own GoldenSwag-FI repository, with single default split of 1000 examples. Each instance consists of short context prefix and several plausible continuations, and the task is to either generate or select the most coherent continuation. We define generative cloze formulation (CF), where the model directly completes the text, and multiple-choice formulation (MCF), where the model selects one continuation from four options.

For FinBench v2 we use the Finnish portion created with the EuroEval ScandiSent generation script (Nielsen, 2023; Nielsen et al., 2024) and archived in our repository. The original Finnish split contains 10 000 training reviews; from these we construct train, validation, and test splits of 1 024, 256, and 2 048 examples, respectively. We define cloze formulation (CF), where the model infers the sentiment from the review text, and multiple-choice formulation (MCF), where the model is explicitly asked to choose between \"positiivinen\" and \"negatiivinen\". For each formulation we use five prompt variants (p0p4) to measure prompt sensitivity.

Each example is assigned one of seven topics: science/technology, travel, politics, sports, health, entertainment, or geography. For FinBench v2 we use an archived Finnish subset of Davlan/sib200 containing single default split of 1004 examples, while the original repository also provides three-way split (701/99/204) for Finnish. As with other datasets, we define cloze formulation (CF), where the model infers the topic from the text, and multiple-choice formulation (MCF), where all seven topic labels are provided explicitly. For each formulation we use five prompt variants (p0p4) to measure prompt sensitivity. 19 Cloze formulation (CF) prompts sib200_fi_cf_fbv2_p0 1 Päättele, mitä aihetta seuraava uutinen käsittelee.

The benchmark covers several task categories, including relational reasoning (analogies), sentiment analysis (emotions), causal reasoning (empirical judgments), world knowledge, alignment and safety (HHH alignment), paraphrase identification, and commonsense reasoning (similarities and abstraction). For FinBench v2, each FIN-Bench task is provided as separate subset derived from the Hugging Face version of the dataset (TurkuNLP/FIN-bench). All subsets contain single default split, and each is implemented in two formulations: cloze formulation (CF) prompt, where the model reasons directly from the question text, and multiple-choice formulation (MCF) prompt, where answer options are presented explicitly. For both formulations we use five prompt variants (p0p4) to measure prompt sensitivity across tasks. Analogies The FIN-Bench analogies task evaluates relational reasoning over word pairs: the model must complete analogies of the form is to as is to ?. We provide both cloze formulation (CF), where the model generates the missing word, and multiple-choice formulation (MCF), where it selects the correct completion from small set of candidates. This subset contains 130 examples.

The goal is to identify the predominant emotion expressed by the text. We provide cloze formulation (CF), where the model infers the emotion from the text without being reminded of the label set, and multiple-choice formulation (MCF), where the eight emotion labels are explicitly listed in the prompt. This subset contains 160 examples.

In addition, the title fields have been machine-translated into Finnish. The resulting dataset is used as generative machine reading comprehension task in FinBench v2 and consists of 84 688 training examples and 5 844 validation examples, with no separate test split. Each instance contains title, context paragraph, and question, and the model must generate short answer span based on the given context. We define five generative prompt variants (p0p4) to measure prompt sensitivity.

Natural language generation 45 Prompt type There are five different types of prompts: MCF, ITC, CF, TC, GEN: 1. Informed formulation (a) Multiple choice formulation (MCF) Choices for multiple-choice tasks are provided in the prompt using e.g, A/B/C/D prefixes with targets being those prefixes (b) Informed text classification (ITC) 2. Uninformed formulation (a) Cloze formulation (CF) Choices for multiple-choice tasks are not provided in context (b) Text Classification (TC) Target labels are not provided in context 3. Natural language generation (GEN) No need to formulate output, but text relating to dataset fields Dataset fields Represent what text will be put inside the brackets Guideline Read the metadata. Produce prompts for the tasks either by translating or writing your own. Be mindful about providing prompts in the same format as it is asked for, as defined in the Task class and Prompt type. For Informed formulation prompts, write the target labels in parentheses for the correct format. Each task is under separate header on different page. After annotation, mark your initials on the prompt number, e.g., (1. Prompt 1 AR:) Rather, provide one prompt for all tasks instead of giving five prompts for one task A.8 GoldenSwag Annotation Guidelines An example annotation task: Is this perfect ENG -> FIN translation? - IF NO: copy/paste the Finnish one, into the answer, and then correct it. - IF YES: write <<<GOOD>>> in the answer. 1 {'ind': 4121, 'activity_label': 'Rope skipping', 'ctx_a': 'A person is jumping rope on white mat. man is kneeling down on the ground in front of red table.', 'ctx_b': 'he', 'ctx': 'A person is jumping rope on white mat. man is kneeling down on the ground in front of red table. he', 'endings': ['takes large knife and begins sharpening it.', 'gets up and starts jumping rope.', 'does forward flip over the table.', 'is throwing darts at target.'], 'source_id': 'activitynetv_lMYtmGRAn8k', 'split': 'val', 'split_type': 'indomain', 'label': '1'} 2 3 {'ind': 4121, 'activity_label': 'Rope skipping', 'ctx_a': 'Henkilö hyppää köyttä valkoisella matolla.

This is to improve the quality of data, i.e. removing bad examples from the dataset. You should ask yourself: is the assigned label \"the most appropriate\" for the sentence. Reminder: There were 8 possible labels for the task: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust."
