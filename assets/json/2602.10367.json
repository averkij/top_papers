            "title": "1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in\nhealthcare, assisting with tasks ranging from answering pa-\ntient inquiries to supporting clinical decision-making [25].\nDeploying AI in high-stakes clinical settings requires that\nthese models demonstrate robust performance across di-\nverse, real-world scenarios [21].",
            "content": "While benchmarks serve as essential standards for tracking progress, existing medical benchmarks face substantial obstacles in both data construction and evaluation. First, on the data side, most benchmarks are static [25], leading to two issues. (i) They become temporally misaligned with rapidly evolving medical knowledge. Clinical guidelines and health policies are frequently updated, and new diseases and public health emergencies can emerge unexpectedly [14]. As result, static test sets risk becoming increasingly misaligned with the evolving standards of realworld clinical practice [3]. (ii) They are vulnerable to data contamination. Because LLMs are trained on massive and Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhiling Yan et al. often opaque corpora, publicly released benchmarks may inadvertently appear in training data. Consequently, strong scores may reflect memorization rather than genuine clinical reasoning, undermining credibility of evaluation [19]. Second, on the evaluation side, commonly used metrics remain inadequate for open-ended clinical reasoning. Lexicaloverlap metrics (e.g., BLEU) fail to capture semantic and clinical correctness [17, 22], and multiple-choice formats are poorly aligned with the open-ended and dynamic nature of real-world clinical workflows [10]. Recent work has adopted LLM-as-a-Judge [41] for holistic scoring, while they rely on implicit model intuition and typically lack explicit, fine-grained criteria that support objective verification [1]. While recent works attempt to address these challenges, they fall short. Approaches utilizing LLM prompts to modify data, e.g. dynamic benchmarks [26, 39], cannot update underlying seed cases. They fail to reflect real-world medical evolution and risk introducing model-generated biases. Conversely, benchmarks like MedArena [37] and HealthBench [1] depend on extensive human annotation, making them prohibitively expensive and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce LiveMedBench, multilingual, multi-specialty, rubric-based benchmark that comprises 2,756 real-world cases paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. To build LiveMedBench, we develop data pipelinethe Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Frameworkthat continuously harvests new clinical cases (weekly) from active online medical communities, focusing on scenarios resolved by verified physicians. The pipeline coordinates multiple agents with RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) [15, 40] to cross-check case details against authoritative medical evidence, thereby validating clinical plausibility and enforcing consistency with established standards. For evaluation, we propose an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that converts physician responses into case-specific rubrics consisting of self-contained, objective criteria and uses them to grade open-ended model outputs, achieving strong alignment with human experts (Figure 1 - Panel B). We evaluate 38 LLMs spanning both proprietary and open-source models across general-purpose and medically specialized architectures. As illustrated in Figure 1 - Panel A, performance diverges markedly around the knowledge cutoff date. This degradation is consistent with temporal misalignment and potential exposure to earlier cases. Notably, even the state-of-the-art GPT-5.2 achieves only 39.2%, while 84% of evaluated models exhibit significant performance drops on post-cutoff cases, underscoring the pervasive risk of data contamination. Our error analysis identifies critical failure mode: the dominant bottleneck is contextual applicationthe inability to synthesize medical facts with patient-specific constraints (3548% of errors). Furthermore, retrieval-based knowledge injection recovers much of this performance loss, confirming that contemporary failures stem from knowledge gaps rather than innate reasoning deficits. In summary, our main contributions are: (1) We introduce LiveMedBench, novel benchmark updated weekly to mitigate data contamination and knowledge obsolescence. To date, the dataset comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 specialties and multiple languages. (2) We propose Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that leverages automated evidence verification to align benchmark data with authoritative medical standards, ensuring high clinical integrity. (3) We develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that enables scalable, fine-grained assessment by decomposing expert responses into 16,702 unique, case-specific criteria. (4) We provide rigorous evaluation of 38 LLMs, systematically contrasting proprietary and open-source models across general and medical domains to characterize the current landscape of clinical AI."

The Screener standardizes each raw discussion thread 𝑇 into structured clinical representation following the SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) framework [32]. It outputs triplet 𝐷𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟 = {𝐿𝑁 , 𝑄, 𝐿𝐴}, where 𝐿𝑁 is the set of atomic patient narrative entities (Subjective/Objective), 𝑄 is the primary user query, and 𝐿𝐴 is the set of actionable physician advice elements (Assessment/Plan). Concretely, the Screener performs: (i) Narrative aggregation (𝐿𝑁 ): extract and merge patient-provided clinical facts from 𝑇 . (ii) Query extraction (𝑄): identify the explicit question/request for medical guidance. (iii) Advice extraction (𝐿𝐴): extract actionable diagnostic or management recommendations from verified physician replies.

The Validator assesses the quality and factual consistency of the structured triplet 𝐷𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟 = {𝐿𝑁 , 𝑄, 𝐿𝐴} and outputs validation vector 𝑉 = {𝑆𝑐𝑐, 𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑓 , 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛 }. (i) Query validity (𝑆𝑐𝑐 ): binary score indicating whether 𝑄 is clinically meaningful chief complaint (CC) as defined by Elys taxonomy [5]. (ii) Narrative sufficiency (𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑓 ): the fraction of required clinical information items (derived from 𝑄) that are supported (entailed) by the patient narrative 𝐿𝑁 , inspired by [6]. Concretely, we first derive minimal checklist 𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑞 of atomic requirements needed to answer 𝑄 (e.g., onset, severity, red flags), and then compute 𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑓 as the proportion of items in 𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑞 that can be verified from 𝐿𝑁 . (iii) Evidence alignment (𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛): an evidence-based validity score for physician advice 𝐿𝐴 computed by checking each advice element against retrieved medical evidence (Clinical Guidelines, PubMed, StatPearls, etc.) [2, 40]. Following MedRAG [40], we retrieve top-𝑘 evidence snippets using MedCPT retriever [12] and score each advice element with 𝑣 (𝑎 𝑗 ) {1.0, 0.5, 0.0} (supported/neutral/contradicted). We apply veto strategy: if any 𝑎 𝑗 is contradicted, the entire case is discarded. candidate case 𝐷 is retained if and only if 𝐾𝑒𝑒𝑝 (𝐷) (𝑆𝑐𝑐 = 1) (𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑓 > 𝜏𝑖𝑛𝑓 ) (𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛 > 𝜏𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛), where 𝜏𝑖𝑛𝑓 = 0.5 and 𝜏𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛 = 0.5 are predefined thresholds. 3.2.3 The Controller. The Controller accepts the valid candidate 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 = {𝐿𝑁 , 𝑄, 𝐿𝐴} from the Validator and performs final audit before generating the canonical natural language output. It verifies that every atomic element in 𝐿𝑁 𝐿𝐴 is explicitly supported by the original thread 𝑇 : 𝐾𝑒𝑒𝑝 (𝐷) 𝑥 (𝐿𝑁 𝐿𝐴), Supported(𝑥,𝑇 ). Any unsupported or fabricated element leads to discarding the case to prevent synthetic contamination. Cases that pass are synthesized into coherent narrative (𝑁 ) and advice (𝐴), yielding the final triplet 𝐷 = {𝑁 , 𝑄, 𝐴}."

            "content": "3.3.1 Automated Rubric Generator. Following the taxonomy of Arora et al. [1], the generator transforms the verified advice list 𝐿𝐴 into structured rubric 𝑅. We adapt five of Arora et al. [1]s seven themes to assign each case dominant ThemeEmergency Referrals, Context-Seeking, Expertise-Tailored Communication, Responding under Uncertainty, or Response Depth. This theme serves as contextual filter for the subsequent generation steps: Step 1: Theme-Guided Fact Extraction. The agent filters 𝐿𝐴 to retain only medical facts and instructions relevant to the assigned Theme. For instance, if the Theme is Emergency Referrals, long-term dietary advice is discarded to focus strictly on triage accuracy. Step 2: Bipolar Criterion Formulation. Extracted facts are converted into binary criteria with dual polarity. Positive criteria reward the correct inclusion of key facts (e.g., Does the model identify the likely cause as Norovirus?), while negative criteria penalize hallucinations or contradictions (e.g., Does the model incorrectly suggest antibiotics for viral infection?). Step 3: Axis Assignment and Weighting. Each criterion is labeled with an evaluation Axis (Accuracy, Completeness, Communication Quality, Context Awareness, or Safety) and assigned weight 𝑤 𝑗 [10, 10]. Positive weights denote reward criteria, while negative weights flag penalties. Extreme weights (e.g., 𝑤 𝑗 = 10) represent life-critical details where errors could compromise patient safety. 3.3.2 Rubric-based Grader. Following the generation of the case-specific rubric 𝑅 = {(𝑐1, 𝑤1), . . . , (𝑐𝑚, 𝑤𝑚)}, the Rubricbased Grader systematically assesses the models response by determining the satisfaction of each atomic criterion. We employ model grader to independently verify whether each criterion 𝑐 𝑗 is met or not met based on the models output. The final per-case score is calculated by summing the weights of satisfied criteria, normalized by the maximum possible positive score: (cid:32) (cid:205)𝑚 𝑗=1 (cid:33) , 0, (1) 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = clip 𝑤 𝑗 I(Model = 𝑐 𝑗 ) (cid:205)𝑘 {𝑝 𝑤𝑝 >0} 𝑤𝑘 where I() is the indicator function equal to 1 if the criterion is met, and 0 otherwise. The denominator represents the total score achievable if all positive criteria are met. The clipping function ensures the score remains within [0, 1] even if substantial penalties (negative weights) occur. models overall LiveMedBench score is derived from the mean of these case-level scores."

Medical-specific models, including the Baichuan-series [4, 27] and MedGemma-series [23]. All models were evaluated in zero-shot setting to assess their innate clinical capabilities without task-specific learning. For reproducibility, we set the temperature to 0. Detailed model specifications are provided in Appendix B. Implementation Details. We detail the specific models employed in our frameworks. In the Multi-agent Clinical Curation phase, both the Screener and Controller agents utilized Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 for efficient processing, while the Validator agent employed openai/gpt-oss-120b to ensure rigorous verification. For the Automated Rubricbased Evaluation, the Rubric Generator was powered by Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, while Rubric-based Grader uses gpt-4.1-2025-04-14 following Arora et al. [1]. Evaluation Metric. For each case, the grader evaluates the models response against the specific rubric criteria generated by the Rubric Generator using binary judgment (Met vs. Not Met). The final score is calculated by summing the full points of satisfied criteria, normalized by the maximum possible score, and clipped to the range [0, 1], where higher scores indicate superior clinical performance. Human Validation. To validate the data quality and the reliability of our evaluation framework, we conducted rigorous human evaluation with two physicians proficient in both English and Chinese. We randomly sampled 50 cases (comprising 292 unique criteria) and performed assessment across three dimensions: 1. Data Quality: Physicians rated the clinical coherence of the patient narrative/query and the quality of the reference physician advice on 3-point scale (0 2), where scores 1 denote high quality and agreement. 2. Criterion Validity: Physicians assessed whether each generated rubric criterion was clinically accurate and relevant to the case (0/1, where 1 indicates agreement). 3. Grader Reliability: To verify the automated grader, physicians independently evaluated model responses against the rubric criteria. We calculated the inter-rater reliability between physicians using Gwets AC1 [8]. To quantify the alignment between the model grader and human experts, we employed two statistical measures: (1) the Macro F1 score for criterionlevel agreement, following Arora et al. [1]; and (2) the Pearson correlation coefficient for case-level scoring alignment. Further details on the human evaluation protocol are available in Appendix C."

However, the gap is narrowing significantly. Notably, GPT-OSS 120B (25.0%) and GLM4.5 (22.5%) deliver performance comparable to, or exceeding, several high-tier proprietary models, such as Gemini 3 Pro (18.3%) and Claude 3.7 Sonnet (17.0%). Moreover, we observe that smaller open-source models such as Qwen3-14B (15.4%) and QwQ-32B (13.5%) demonstrate reasoning capabilities that are competitive with substantially larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro (16.1%). From deployment perspective, while proprietary models offer peak performance, Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhiling Yan et al. Figure 4: The evaluation results of 38 LLMs on LiveMedBench, categorized into proprietary (green) and open-source (yellow) models. Models marked with cross (+) are specialized medical models, while others are general-purpose. Solid bars represent performance on the full dataset, while hatched bars indicate performance on cases post-dating the models knowledge cutoff. open-source models offer viable alternative for privacysensitive environments where local deployment is mandatory, and for edge-device deployment where computational resources are limited. General-Purpose vs. Medical-Specific Models. Contrary to the intuition that domain specialization yields superior performance, our results indicate that general-purpose models consistently outperform specialized medical models. For instance, the general-purpose GPT-5.2 (39.2%) significantly surpasses the top-performing specialized model, Baichuan-series. This disparity is likely attributable to the scaling laws, where the massive parameter counts and diverse training of general models provide more robust foundation than smaller, domain-tuned architectures. Nevertheless, medical models exhibit strong parameter efficiency. For example, Med-Gemma 27B (5.9%) matches the performance of the general-purpose Gemini 2.5 Flash (6.4%), suggesting that specialized tuning remains potent strategy for smaller-scale deployments. Data Contamination and Knowledge Obsolescence. To empirically quantify the dual impacts of data contamination and knowledge obsolescence, we evaluated the models on subset of cases published after their respective knowledge cutoff dates (or release dates, for models with undisclosed cutoffs). As illustrated in Figure 4, 84% of the models (32 out of 38) exhibited performance degradation when transitioning from the full dataset to the post-cutoff subset. Notably, the GLM series appeared most susceptible to data leakage, with all variants showing marked decline in accuracy; the most pronounced drop occurred in Kimi-K2, which suffered 3.99% decrease. Furthermore, even models without precipitous drop failed to demonstrate significant performance gains on recent data. Figure 1 further details the evaluation across different time windows, revealing consistent downward trend in average performance on contemporary cases (e.g., those post after January 2025). These findings underscore the effect of data contamination, which artificially inflates scores on seen data, and knowledge obsolescence, which leads to failures on unseen medical knowledge. This explains why static benchmark is not rigorous and reliable to evaluate LLMs performance, highlighting the necessity of LiveMedBench."

We benchmark our method against standard LLM-as-a-Judge baseline [41]. Table 2 reveals critical performance disparity: our Rubricbased Grader achieves strong Pearson correlation of 0.54 with human scores (𝑝 < 104), whereas the baseline yields weak, non-significant correlation of 0.26 (𝑝 = 0.07). As shown in Figure 1, the baseline exhibits significant skew towards higher scores, failing to penalize poor responses due to length bias and lack of sensitivity to safety hazards. In contrast, our approach adheres strictly to clinical evidence, correctly assigning zero scores for critical errors (e.g., missed contraindications) where the holistic judge failed. These findings underscore the necessity of granular verification for high-stakes medical evaluation."

Performance across Clinical Specialties. The heat map (Figure 5, left) reveals distinct performance hierarchy: proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5.2) consistently populate the high-performing green region, significantly outpacing open-source and specialized alternatives. Across all models, performance is non-uniform. We observe consistently stronger performance in highprevalence specialties such as Gastroenterology & Hepatology (GI/Hep) and Emergency Medicine (EM). This likely reflects the abundance of training data available for these common conditions. Conversely, models struggle significantly in niche or highly specialized surgical fields, e.g. Dentistry/Oral Surgery (Dent/Oral), Pediatric Surgery (Peds Surg), and Allergy/ Immunology (A/I). This suggests knowledge gap in current LLMs regarding specialized procedural and diagnostic nuances that are less represented in general training corpora. We also observed low correlations between general internal medicine specialties and niche fields like Pathology (see Appendix D.3). Performance across Themes.

All models achieve their lowest error rates on Accuracy, yet struggle substantially with Completeness and Communication Quality, suggesting that current training paradigms optimize for factual correctness but remain deficient in structural thoroughness and contextual nuance. Qualitative Root Causes. We further audited the bottom100 scoring cases per model using GPT-4.1 to classify root causes into seven error types (method and results in Appendix D.1). Contrary to common assumptions, hallucinations (MHME) and knowledge gaps (KGOC) are no longer the dominant failure modes for leading models (both near 08%). Instead, the vast majority of errors stem from Contextual Neglect and Integration Failure (CNIF: 3548%) and Guideline Overgeneralization (GOPR: 2232%), indicating that models possess the requisite medical facts but struggle to tailor them to patient-specific constraints such as comorbidities or contraindications. Additionally, pairwise Jaccard similarity of the bottom-100 cases across models is low (mean=0.24, Figure 16), confirming that failures reflect model-specific capability gaps rather than data quality artifacts."

Dataset A.1 Online Medical Communities A.1.1 DXY. DXY5 is widely recognized as the largest online academic community for healthcare professionals in China. It features rigorous Question-and-Answer (Q&A) module where inquiries are addressed by verified licensed physicians. The platform covers comprehensive range of clinical specialties and is distinguished by its strict verification process, ensuring that the medical advice provided is professional, reliable, and grounded in clinical practice. A.1.2 MedLive. MedLive6 is premier professional medical platform in China, primarily designed to support clinical decision-making and academic exchange among physicians. Unlike general health forums, MedLive hosts high-density technical discussions, expert consensus interpretations, and complex case studies. Its data is characterized by high degree of professional terminology and clinical depth, making it an invaluable source for evaluating an LLMs ability to handle specialized medical contexts. iCliniq. iCliniq7 is leading global telemedicine A.1.3 platform that connects patients with doctors across more than 80 medical specialties. The platform operates on \"second opinion\" model, where users post medical queries that are answered by credentialed and verified medical experts. The interactions on iCliniq typically follow structured format comprising detailed patient query followed by comprehensive, empathetic, and evidence-based response from qualified physician, providing high-quality Englishlanguage training and evaluation data. SDN. The Student Doctor Network (SDN)8 is one A.1.4 of the largest non-profit educational communities for healthcare students and professionals in North America. While it serves broad educational purpose, its specific clinical forums facilitate peer-to-peer discussions among medical students, residents, and attending physicians. These dialogues often involve collaborative clinical reasoning, detailed case breakdowns, and debates on treatment protocols, offering unique \"clinician-to-clinician\" perspective distinct from standard doctor-patient interactions. A.2 License Similar to [9], we scrape only the content of post discussions from medical websites DXY, MedLive, iCliniq and SDN. Further, we only scrape publicly visible portions of websites, avoiding any data collection that might be pay walled or require login or interaction with the website. Following [9] we abide by Fair Use 107: the fair use of copyrighted work, including such use by ... scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright, where fair use is determined by the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educa tional purposes, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as whole, 5https://dxy.com/ 6https://www.medlive.cn/ 7https://www.icliniq.com/qa/ 8https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/ and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copy righted work. Finally, we use the collected problems for academic purposes only and in addition, do not train on the collected problems. A.3 Theme and Axis Definitions LiveMedBench adopts and adapts the evaluation taxonomy introduced by HealthBench [1]. We retain five of HealthBenchs seven Themes (dropping Global Health and Health Data Tasks, which are less represented in the online medical communities we target) and replace the Instruction Following axis with Safety to better capture contraindication and harm-prevention failures in open-ended clinical advice. A.3.1 Themes. Themes are high-level categories of healthrelated tasks that reflect distinct challenges in real-world clinical interactions. Each case is assigned exactly one theme. Emergency Referrals. Evaluates whether the model recognizes emergent situations and steers the user toward immediate in-person care when appropriate, while avoiding unnecessary escalation in non-urgent scenarios. Context-Seeking. Assesses whether the model identifies when key clinical context is missing and proactively requests the most informative additional information before providing definitive answer. Expertise-Tailored Communication. Tests whether the model infers the users level of medical expertise (e.g., layperson vs. healthcare professional) and adjusts terminology, depth, and tone accordingly. Responding under Uncertainty. Measures whether the model appropriately hedges when the evidence is ambiguous or incomplete, avoiding overconfident claims that could mislead the user. Response Depth. Examines whether the model calibrates the level of detail to the complexity of the queryproviding concise answers for simple questions and comprehensive explanations for complex ones. A.3.2 Axes. Axes define the behavioral dimensions along which each rubric criterion evaluates model response. single case may contain criteria spanning multiple axes. Accuracy. Whether the response contains only factually correct information aligned with current medical consensus, including appropriate recognition of evolving or uncertain evidence. Completeness. Whether the response includes all clinically important information needed to be safe and helpful, such as key diagnostic steps, red flags, or follow-up recommendations. Communication Quality. Whether the response is well-structured, clear, and uses level of technical depth and vocabulary matched to the user. Context Awareness. Whether the model appropriately responds to contextual cues present in the conversation (e.g., patient history, geographic setting, stated constraints) and seeks clarification when needed. Safety. Whether the model avoids recommending contraindicated treatments, recognizes potential harms, LiveMedBench: Contamination-Free Medical Benchmark for LLMs with Automated Rubric Evaluation Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA and includes necessary warnings or disclaimers for high-risk situations. A.4 Details of Data Statistics LiveMedBench currently comprises total of 2,756 clinical cases and 16,702 unique rubric criteria, establishing robust foundation for granular medical evaluation. The detailed distribution of the dataset is illustrated in Figure 3. Clinical Specialties. To ensure comprehensive coverage, the benchmark spans 38 distinct clinical specialties. As shown in Figure 3(a), the distribution is naturally long-tailed, reflecting real-world prevalence. The most represented specialties include Gastroenterology and Hepatology (GI/Hep) with 375 cases, Urology (Uro) with 210 cases, and Psychiatry (Psych) with 205 cases. This diversity ensures that models are tested across wide spectrum of medical knowledge, from general practice to highly specialized fields like NeuroOncology. Linguistic Diversity. LiveMedBench supports bilingual evaluation to assess cross-lingual generalization. As depicted in Figure 3(c), the dataset includes 1,568 English cases (sourced from iCliniq and SDN) and 1,188 Chinese cases (sourced from DXY and Medlive), maintaining balanced representation to rigorously evaluate performance in both linguistic contexts. Health Contexts. The dataset categorizes cases into five distinct thematic clusters to evaluate specific capabilities. As shown in Figure 3(b), Expertise-Tailored Communication is the dominant theme, accounting for 47.4% of the cases, followed by Responding under Uncertainty (27.2%) and Response Depth (17.6%). Smaller proportions are dedicated to Context-Seeking (4.5%) and Emergency Referrals (3.3%), focusing on critical safety and interactive diagnosis skills. Behavioral Dimensions. Our automated rubric system generates criteria across five evaluation axes. As illustrated in Figure 3(d), the majority of criteria focus on Accuracy (51.2%), ensuring that clinical correctness remains the primary metric. Completeness accounts for 24.7%, while Communication Quality, Context Awareness, and Safety comprise 9.4%, 7.8%, and 6.9% respectively. This multi-dimensional structure allows for holistic assessment of model performance beyond mere factual recall. Granularity of Evaluation. key feature of LiveMedBench is its case-specific evaluation. Figure 3(e) shows the distribution of criteria count per case, which follows normallike distribution. Cases are evaluated on anywhere from minimum of 2 to maximum of 19 criteria, with an average of 6.06 criteria per case. This variance reflects the complexity of different medical scenarios, where simple queries require fewer checks and complex diagnoses demand extensive validation. Experimental Setup B.1 Models Details of models considered in our study is in Table 7. B.2 Details in Curation Framework Prompts for the screener are in Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8. Prompts for the validator are in Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11. The prompt for the comtroller is in Figure 12. B.3 Details in Evaluation Framework Prompts for the Rubric Generator and Rubric-based Grader are in Figure 13 and Figure 14, respectively. Human Study Details C.1 Rating Scale Table 8, Table 9 and Table 10 detail the specific rating criteria provided to physicians for each evaluation task. C.2 Inter-rater Reliability To assess the consistency of human evaluation, we utilized Gwets AC1 [8] statistics instead of the traditional Cohens Kappa. This choice addresses the well-known Kappa Paradox frequently encountered in medical dataset evaluation, where high agreement rates can yield paradoxically low Kappa scores due to skewed trait prevalence (i.e., unbalanced class distributions). Mathematical Formulation. Consider reliability study with 𝑛 items (cases) rated by 2 raters into 𝑄 distinct categories (e.g., 𝑄 = 3 for our 0-2 scale). Let 𝑟𝑖𝑞 be 1 if rater 𝑟 classifies item 𝑖 into category 𝑞, and 0 otherwise. The Gwets AC1 coefficient, denoted as 𝛾1, is defined as: 𝐴𝐶1 = 𝑝𝑎 𝑝𝑒 (𝛾) 1 𝑝𝑒 (𝛾) (2) where 𝑝𝑎 represents the observed agreement probability: 𝑝𝑎 = 1 𝑛 𝑛 𝑄 𝑖=1 𝑞= 𝑟𝑖,1 𝑟𝑖,2 1 (simplified for 2 raters) (3) and 𝑝𝑒 (𝛾) represents the chance-agreement probability. unlike Kappa which estimates chance based on individual rater marginals, AC1 estimates it based on the average marginal probability 𝜋𝑞 of category 𝑞: 𝜋𝑞 = 1 2𝑛 𝑛 (𝑟𝑖,1,𝑞 + 𝑟𝑖,2,𝑞) 𝑖=1 The chance agreement 𝑝𝑒 (𝛾) is then calculated as: 𝑝𝑒 (𝛾) = 1 𝑄 1 𝑄 𝜋𝑞 (1 𝜋𝑞) 𝑞=1 This formulation ensures that the metric remains stable even when the marginal probabilities are highly skewed, making it the preferred metric for validating rigorous medical benchmarks. C.3 Criterion-level Consensus To rigorously evaluate the reliability of our automated Rubricbased Grader at the criterion level, we employ the Macro F1 Score (𝑀𝐹 1), following the evaluation protocol from HealthBench [1].

Metric Definition. Given the potential class imbalance in grading (e.g., majority of criteria might be Met or Not Met depending on the model quality), standard accuracy metrics can be misleading. Therefore, we treat the grading task as binary classification problem (Positive class: Met; Negative class: Not Met). The Macro F1 score is calculated as the unweighted average of the F1 scores for both the positive and negative classes. Let 𝑇 𝑃, 𝐹 𝑃, and 𝐹 𝑁 denote True Positives, False Positives, and False Negatives, respectively. The F1 scores for the positive (𝐹 1𝑝𝑜𝑠 ) and negative (𝐹 1𝑛𝑒𝑔) classes are defined as: 𝐹 1𝑝𝑜𝑠 = 𝐹 1𝑛𝑒𝑔 = 2 𝑇 𝑃𝑝𝑜𝑠 2 𝑇 𝑃𝑝𝑜𝑠 + 𝐹 𝑃𝑝𝑜𝑠 + 𝐹 𝑁𝑝𝑜𝑠 2 𝑇 𝑃𝑛𝑒𝑔 2 𝑇 𝑃𝑛𝑒𝑔 + 𝐹 𝑃𝑛𝑒𝑔 + 𝐹 𝑁𝑛𝑒𝑔 (6) (7) The final Macro F1 score is the arithmetic mean: 𝑀𝐹 1 = 𝐹 1𝑝𝑜𝑠 + 𝐹 1𝑛𝑒𝑔 (8) This formulation ensures balanced sensitivity to model performance across both classes, preventing the score from being dominated by the majority class. Calculation Protocols. We compute the consensus metrics in two distinct stages to establish both human baseline and model validity score: Human-Human Agreement (𝐹 1𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛): To quantify the intrinsic difficulty of the grading task, we calculate the 𝑀𝐹 1 between the two physicians. We treat Physician as the Ground Truth and Physician as the Predictor (note that since 𝑀𝐹 1 is symmetric, the order does not affect the result). LiveMedBench: Contamination-Free Medical Benchmark for LLMs with Automated Rubric Evaluation Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA System Prompt: the Screener Role: You are an expert Medical Data Structurer. Task: Your goal is to extract the Patient Narrative (𝐿𝑁 ) from the provided raw dialogue. This corresponds to the Subjective and Objective sections of the SOAP note. Instructions: Decompose: classify symptoms/history) and Objective (measurable data/facts). patients Analyze text and the information into Subjective (reported Filter: Remove all non-clinical text, including greetings, emotional fluff, gratitude, and irrelevant conversational fillers. Subjective Extraction: Focus on the History of Present Illness (HPI), chief complaints, pain levels, and description of symptoms. Objective Extraction: Focus on specific data points such as current medications, dosage, vital signs, or lab results. Anonymity: Ensure no personally identifiable information (names, specific locations) is included. Input: [Raw Patient Dialogue] Output Format: Subjective: [List of patients history, chief complaints, and symptoms] Objective: [List of verifiable data: vitals, lab results, and medications (or \"None\" if absent)] Figure 6: The prompt template used for the screener to extract L_N. System Prompt: the Screener Role: You are Medical Intent Analyzer. Task: Identify and refine the Primary Query (𝑄) from the patients submission. Instructions: Identify: pinpoint the core medical question the user is asking. Explicitize: If the query is implicit (e.g., \"I am worried about this lump\"), convert it into an explicit clinical question (e.g., \"What are the potential causes of this lump and does it require urgent care?\"). Contextualize: Ensure the query is self-contained and understandable without reading the full narrative. Input: [Raw Patient Dialogue] Output Format: single, clear question string. Figure 7: The prompt template used for the screener to extract Q. Model-Human Agreement (𝐹 1𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 𝐴𝑣𝑔): Since there is no single Gold Standard for subjective medical evaluation, our automated grader must demonstrate robustness by aligning with multiple human experts. We calculate the alignment score as the average of the 𝑀𝐹 1 scores against each physician: 𝐹 1𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 𝐴𝑣𝑔 = 𝑀𝐹 1(𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙, 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝐴) + 𝑀𝐹 1(𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙, 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝐵) 2 (9) where 𝑀𝐹 1(𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙, 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝐴) treats Physician as Ground Truth and the Model Grader as the Predictor. high 𝐹 1𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 𝐴𝑣𝑔 indicates that the automated grader generalizes well and captures the consensus view of medical professionals. C.4 Case-level Consensus To evaluate the reliability of automated scoring at the aggregate case level, we assessed the correlation between automated scores and human consensus. We compared our Rubric-based Grader against standard LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. Scoring Protocols. Human Ground Truth (𝑆𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛): For each case 𝑖, the ground truth score is defined as the arithmetic mean of the scores provided by the two physicians. 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝐴 and 𝑆 (𝑖 ) Let 𝑆 (𝑖 ) 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝐵 be the scores for case 𝑖. The consensus human score is: 𝑆 (𝑖 ) 𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛 = 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝐴 + 𝑆 (𝑖 ) 𝑆 (𝑖 ) 2 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝐵 (10) LLM-as-a-Judge Baseline (𝑆 𝐽 𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒 ): We prompted the same LLM (GPT-4.1) used in our Rubric-based Grader to evaluate the models response directly based on general quality, following the standard judging protocol in [41]. To ensure comparability, these scalar scores were normalized to the [0, 1] interval. Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhiling Yan et al. System Prompt: the Screener Role: You are Senior Clinical Consultant. Task: Extract the Physician Advice (𝐿𝐴) from the verified doctors response. This corresponds to the Assessment and Plan sections of the SOAP note. Instructions: Extract: Identify the doctors primary diagnosis (or differential diagnosis), reasoning, and specific recommendations. Actionability: Focus on actionable steps: medications, lifestyle changes, \"red flag\" warnings, or referral instructions (e.g., \"See cardiologist\"). Factuality: Strictly adhere to the doctors original text. Do not hallucinate or add medical advice not present in the source. Input: [Verified Physician Response] Output Format: Assessment: [List of doctors reasoning/diagnosis] Plan: [List of actionable recommendations] Figure 8: The prompt template used for the screener to extract L_A. System Prompt: the Validator Role: You are Medical Taxonomy Expert based on Elys Taxonomy of Clinical Questions. Task: Evaluate the Primary Query (𝑄) to determine if it constitutes clinically meaningful Chief Complaint (CC) or medical request. Instructions: Analyze: Does 𝑄 fall into valid clinical category (e.g., Symptom, Diagnosis, Management, Prognosis, Therapy)? Filter: Reject queries that are: Nonsense or gibberish. Purely social/chit-chat without medical intent. Asking for illegal acts (e.g., manufacturing drugs). Too vague to be answered (e.g., \"I feel bad\"). Output: Return binary score (1 for Valid, 0 for Invalid). Input: [User Query 𝑄] Output Format (JSON): { \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation...\", \"score\": 1 // or } Figure 9: The prompt template used for the validator to compute S_cc. Correlation Analysis. To benchmark the reliability of our proposed method against standard evaluation approaches, we computed the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (𝜌) separately for both automated methods against the human consensus. We calculate: (1) 𝜌 (𝑆𝑅𝑢𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑐, 𝑆𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛): The alignment between our Rubricbased Grader and physician consensus. (2) 𝜌 (𝑆 𝐽 𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒, 𝑆𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛): The alignment between the standard LLM-as-a-Judge baseline and physician consensus. The correlation coefficient is defined as: 𝜌 = cov(𝑆𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜, 𝑆𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛) 𝜎𝑆𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜 𝜎𝑆𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛 (11) where 𝑆𝐴𝑢𝑡𝑜 {𝑆𝑅𝑢𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑐, 𝑆 𝐽 𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒 }. higher correlation indicates that the automated scoring method more accurately reflects the nuance and variance of professional medical judgment. More Experimental Results D.1 Error Analysis Setup. The prompt used for error analysis is preD.1.1 sented in Figure 15. We classify the causes of AI-generated errors into seven distinct dimensions: Contextual Neglect and Integration Failure: The model fails to incorporate specific patient details (e.g., history, vitals, lab results) provided in the prompt, resulting in generic, template-like responses that lack personalization or ignore critical contraindications. LiveMedBench: Contamination-Free Medical Benchmark for LLMs with Automated Rubric Evaluation Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA System Prompt: the Validator Role: You are Clinical Auditor. Task: Calculate the Narrative Sufficiency Score (𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑓 ). You must determine if the Patient Narrative (𝐿𝑁 ) provides enough context to safely answer the Query (𝑄). Instructions: (1) Step 1 (Derive Requirements): List the atomic clinical facts (𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑞) absolutely necessary to answer 𝑄 (e.g., for \"Headache\", you need: Onset, Severity, Frequency, Triggers). (2) Step 2 (Verify): Check 𝐿𝑁 . For each item in 𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑞, determine if it is present/entailed in the narrative. (3) Step 3 (Score): Calculate the ratio of present items to required items. Input: Query (𝑄): ... Narrative (𝐿𝑁 ): ... Output Format (JSON): { \"required_items\": [\"item1\", \"item2\", \"item3\", ...], \"present_items\": [\"item1\", \"item3\"], \"score\": 0.66 // float between 0.0 and 1.0 } Figure 10: The prompt template used for the validator to compute S_inf. System Prompt: the Validator Role: You are Senior Medical Guideline Validator. Task: Verify the Physician Advice (𝐿𝐴) against the provided Retrieved Evidence (𝐸). Instructions: Verify: Compare each claim 𝑎 𝑗 in 𝐿𝐴 against the retrieved evidence text. Score each claim (𝑣 (𝑎 𝑗 )): 1.0 (Supported): Explicitly confirmed by the evidence. 0.5 (Neutral): Not mentioned in evidence, but clinically standard/safe (common sense). 0.0 (Contradicted): Directly contradicts the evidence (Hallucination/Safety Risk). Input: Physician Advice (𝐿𝐴): ... Retrieved Guidelines (𝐸): ... Output Format (JSON): { \"claims_analysis\": [ {\"claim\": \"Take 500mg Tylenol\", \"verification\": \"Supported by text...\", \"score\": 1.0}, {\"claim\": \"Run marathon immediately\", \"verification\": \"Contradicts rest protocols\", \"score\": 0.0} ], ... } Figure 11: The prompt template used for the validator to compute S_align. Guideline/Protocol Overgeneralization and Rigidity: The model applies clinical guidelines or protocols too broadly or rigidly without adapting to the nuances of the specific case, leading to recommendations that are theoretically correct but clinically inappropriate for the individual patient context. Clinical Reasoning and Synthesis Deficit: The model demonstrates failure to synthesize disparate clinical data points into coherent diagnosis or management plan, including poor prioritization of problems or an inability to infer secondary conclusions from primary evidence. Instruction/Query Misinterpretation and Nonadherence: The model fails to follow explicit user constraints (e.g., word count, specific output format, role-play requirements) or misinterprets the core intent of the clinical query, answering different question than the one asked. Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhiling Yan et al. System Prompt: the Controller Role: You are Medical Quality Assurance Specialist and Editor. Task: You have two sequential objectives: (1) Audit (Fabrication Detection): Verify that every fact in the Structured Narrative (𝐿𝑁 ) and Structured Advice (𝐿𝐴) is explicitly supported by the Original Raw Thread (𝑇 ). (2) Synthesis: Rewrite the structured points into coherent natural language to form the final dataset entry. Instructions: Step 1: The Veto Check: Compare 𝐿𝑁 and 𝐿𝐴 against the Raw Thread 𝑇 . If 𝐿𝑁 or 𝐿𝐴 contains specific details (e.g., drug names, dosages, exact dates, lab values) that are NOT present in 𝑇 , you must REJECT the case immediately. Reasoning: We cannot allow the AI to \"hallucinate\" details to make the story better. Step 2: Natural Language Synthesis: Generate 𝑁 (Narrative): Convert the structured patient facts (𝐿𝑁 ) into fluent paragraph. Generate 𝑄 (Query): Keep the verified Query (𝑄) as is. Generate 𝐴 (Advice): Convert the structured advice points (𝐿𝐴) into coherent physician response (e.g., \"Based on your symptoms, recommend...\"). Input: Original Raw Thread (𝑇 ): [Raw Text...] Structured Narrative (𝐿𝑁 ): [List of facts...] Structured Advice (𝐿𝐴): [List of advice...] Primary Query (𝑄): [Question string...] Output Format (JSON): { \"audit_result\": \"PASS\", // or \"FAIL: Hallucinated [specific detail]\" \"final_output\": { \"N\": \"Coherent patient narrative...\", \"Q\": \"The primary clinical query...\", \"A\": \"Coherent physician response...\" } } Figure 12: The prompt template used for the controller.

Clinical Logic & Completeness Scale Safety & Guideline Alignment Scale Perfect (2) Good (1) Poor (0) Perfect (2) Good (1) Poor (0) The medical history is clear, symptoms align with physiological logic, and the query is fully supported by the provided context. Contains minor omissions (e.g., missing specific temperature) or colloquial phrasing, but the core clinical logic remains self-consistent and actionable. Contains severe logical contradictions (e.g., anatomical errors), or misses critical information required to answer the query (e.g., asking for treatment without symptoms). The response is accurate, precise, and strictly adheres to current first-line clinical guidelines. Provides reasonable conservative management or alternative therapies. May contain minor irrelevant info, but remains clinically safe. Violates absolute contraindications, misses critical red flags, includes factual errors (e.g., wrong dosage), or provides hallucinatory medical advice. Knowledge Gaps and Outdated Content: The model provides factually incorrect medical information, relies on obsolete treatment protocols (often due to training data cutoffs), or produces incomplete answers that demonstrate fundamental lack of domain knowledge. Safety Overestimation and Excessive Caution: The model exhibits excessive risk aversion, such as LiveMedBench: Contamination-Free Medical Benchmark for LLMs with Automated Rubric Evaluation Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA System Prompt: the Automated Rubric Generator Role: You are Senior Medical Examiner. Task: Transform the provided Physician Advice (𝐿𝐴) into structured evaluation rubric 𝑅 consisting of binary criteria. You must tailor the rubric based on the assigned Theme. Input: User Query (𝑄): [Query String] Physician Advice (𝐿𝐴): [Verified Doctors Response] Assigned Theme: [e.g., Emergency Referrals, Response Depth, etc.] Instructions (Step-by-Step): (1) Step 1: Theme-Guided Fact Extraction: Filter 𝐿𝐴 to extract ONLY medical facts relevant to the Assigned Theme. Example: If Theme is \"Emergency Referrals\", ignore diet advice. (2) Step 2: Bipolar Criterion Formulation: Convert facts into binary \"Yes/No\" questions (𝑐 𝑗 ). Positive Criteria: Check for inclusion of correct facts (e.g., \"Does the model mention symptom X?\"). Negative Criteria: Check for hallucinations or dangerous contradictions (e.g., \"Does the model incorrectly suggest drug Y?\"). (3) Step 3: Axis & Weighting (𝑤𝑗 ): Assign an Axis (Accuracy, Safety, Completeness, Context, Communication) and Weight ([10, 10]) to each criterion. +1 to +10: Reward for correct info (Higher = more critical). -1 to -10: Penalty for misinformation/safety risks (Lower = more dangerous). Criticality: 𝑤 = 10 is for life-threatening issues; 𝑤 = 1 is for minor details. Output Format (JSON): [ { \"question\": \"Does the model identify the likely cause as Norovirus?\", \"axis\": \"Accuracy\", \"weight\": }, { \"question\": \"Does the model recommend antibiotics (contraindicated)?\", \"axis\": \"Safety\", \"weight\": -10 } ] Figure 13: The prompt template used for the Automated Rubric Generator. Table 10: Criterion Validity. Rated on binary scale. Rubric Validity Scale Agree (1) Disagree (0) The criterion represents medically necessary check for this specific case. It is factually correct and appropriate for the clinical context. The criterion is factually incorrect, requests information irrelevant to the chief complaint, or sets standard that deviates from routine clinical practice. refusing to answer benign medical queries (false refusal) or recommending unnecessary emergency escalation (e.g., recommending ER visits for minor, selflimiting conditions) due to miscalibrated safety guardrails. Misclassification, Hallucination, and Moderation Errors: The model generates fabricated medical facts or non-existent citations (hallucination), or triggers inappropriate content moderation filters that block legitimate clinical discourse. D.1.2 Results. To understand the root causes of model failures and identify specific weaknesses in state-of-the-art systems, we conducted fine-grained error analysis on the top proprietary models and open-source models. Performance by Evaluation Axis. We first dissected model performance across five evaluation axes. To quantify performance, we define the Error Rate based on the alignment with specific criteria: for positive criteria, failure to satisfy the requirement is recorded as an error; conversely, for negative criteria, any instance where the model triggers the criterion is penalized. As illustrated in Table 3, the majority of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit error rates exceeding 50% across most axes, underscoring significant room for improvement in current large-scale architectures in medical domain. common trend emerges among leading models: they achieve Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhiling Yan et al. System Prompt: the Rubric-based Grader Role: You are an Objective Grader. Task: Evaluate the Model Response (𝑀𝑜𝑢𝑡 ) against the provided Rubric (𝑅). Instructions: Objective Verification: For each criterion in the Rubric, determine if the Model Response satisfies it. Binary Judgment: Return true (Met) or false (Not Met). Positive Criteria Logic: true if the model includes the required information. Negative Criteria Logic: true if the model commits the error (e.g., if the rubric asks \"Does model suggest antibiotics?\" and the model suggests them, return true). Note: The scoring formula handles the negative sign; you simply detect presence. Evidence: Quote the specific sentence from the model output that supports your decision. Input: User Query (𝑄): ...

Rubric (𝑅): [JSON list from Phase 1] Output Format (JSON): [ { \"question\": \"Does the model identify the likely cause as Norovirus?\", \"met\": true, \"reasoning\": \"Model explicitly states 'symptoms suggest Norovirus'.\" }, { \"question\": \"Does the model recommend antibiotics?\", \"met\": false, \"reasoning\": \"Model correctly states 'antibiotics are not effective'.\" } ] Figure 14: The prompt template used for the Rubric-based Grader.

This disparity suggests that while current training paradigms effectively optimize for factual correctness, they remain deficient in capturing nuanced contextual dependencies and structural thoroughness. From Knowledge Deficits to Application Bottlenecks. Beyond quantifying performance, we conducted granular investigation into the underlying drivers of model failure. To diagnose these failures, we performed qualitative audit of the bottom-100 scoring cases for each of the six representative models. Utilizing GPT-4.1 as an evaluator, we generated precise error descriptors for each case. These descriptors were subsequently categorized through semantic clustering into seven distinct error types, as summarized in Table 11. Our analysis reveals critical shift in the failure landscape for leading models. Contrary to common assumptions, fundamental errors such as hallucinations (MHME) and knowledge gaps (KGOC) are no longer the primary limitations. As shown in Table 11, leading models achieve near-zero rates for Misclassification/Hallucination (MHME: 0% for GPT-5.2 and GLM-4.5) and low rates for Knowledge Gaps (KGOC: 0-8%). Similarly, Clinical Reasoning Deficits (CRSD) remain relatively low (10-13%). Instead, the predominant bottleneck is Contextual Application, i.e. the ability to flexibly apply existing medical knowledge to specific patient realities. The vast majority of errors stem from Contextual Neglect and Integration Failure (CNIF: 35-48%) and Guideline Overgeneralization (GOPR) (22-32%). These findings suggest that while leading models possess the necessary medical facts and reasoning capabilities, they struggle to synthesize patient-specific constraints LiveMedBench: Contamination-Free Medical Benchmark for LLMs with Automated Rubric Evaluation Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA System Prompt: Medical Auditor Agent You are Senior Medical Auditor conducting rigorous \"Root Cause Analysis\" on AI failures in clinical settings. # Task You will be presented with medical case where an AI model provided wrong or suboptimal answer compared to the Gold Standard.

Identify the specific gap (e.g., did it miss key symptom? did it hallucinate drug? did it use an old guideline? did it refuse to answer?). 3. Describe the specific mechanism of failure in 1-2 sentences. 4.

(e.g., comorbidities, allergies, or individual history) with general guidelines, resulting in advice that is theoretically correct but practically unsuitable for the specific patient. Figure 16: Correlation of model failed cases. We compute the pairwise correlation of the bottom-100 scoring cases across representative models. Error Correlation and Data Quality. To investigate whether low scores were driven by poor data quality (i.e., bad questions that no model could answer), we calculated the Jaccard similarity of the bottom-100 cases between model pairs (Figure 16). The resulting heatmap shows generally low correlation coefficients (< 0.4) between all model pairs. The mean Jaccard similarity score is 0.24. This lack of overlap indicates that models are failing on different subsets of cases rather than struggling with common set of low-quality samples. This finding confirms that the low scores are attributable to distinct model-specific capability gaps rather than artifacts of the dataset construction. D.2 Theme Correlation While the main text discusses performance correlations across clinical specialties, we also investigated the relationship between different behavioral dimensions (Themes) to understand the transferability of model alignment skills. Figure 17 illustrates the Pearson correlation matrix among the five evaluation themes. D.3 Correlation Analysis We present analyses involving correlation among different specialties. We computed the Pearson correlation coefficient (𝑟 ) among all pairs of clinical specialties in LiveMedBench. Figure 18 illustrates the correlation matrix across 38 clinical specialties. We observe dense high-correlation cluster (𝑟 > 0.9) Cardiology (Cardio), Infectious Disease (ID), Hematology (Hem), and Pulmonary & Critical Care (PCCM). This strong inter-dependency suggests that these fields are likely co-represented frequently in general medical training corpora (e.g., PubMed, MIMIC). Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zhiling Yan et al. protocols, while retaining real-world noise to test model robustness. Usage Disclaimer. LiveMedBench is intended solely for research evaluation. Its contents must not be treated as medical advice, and the dataset must not be used for selfdiagnosis, treatment planning, or training clinical deployment models without regulatory validation. Bias and Representation. Our data sources may carry demographic biases characteristic of internet users in the US and China, and may not fully represent underserved populations. Future iterations will diversify sources to mitigate these gaps. Versioning and Reproducibility To address the moving target challenge inherent in continuous benchmarks, we adopt dual-release strategy: Frozen Snapshots: While LiveMedBench is updated weekly to capture emerging trends, we release Frozen Snapshots with timestamp and checksums (e.g., LiveMedBench-v2026.01). This ensures that results reported in academic literature remain reproducible. Stable Grading Environment: To prevent drift in automated evaluation, our Rubric-based Grader is pinned to specific API versions rather than the volatile latest endpoints. Furthermore, we release the full evaluation code and the exact rubric for every case in the snapshot, enabling offline auditing and consistent re-grading. Figure 17: Theme correlation heatmap. Figure 18: Specialty correlation heatmap. Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients of model performance across different clinical specialties. Conversely, niche verticals such as Pathology (Path) and Radiation Oncology (Rad Onc) exhibit lower correlations with the broader cluster (lighter bands in Figure 18). This isolation indicates that proficiency in general diagnostic reasoning does not automatically transfer to these highly specialized domains, which require distinct knowledge representations. Ethical Considerations Data Privacy. Although all source data is publicly accessible, we implement de-identification, redacting all PII (names, specific locations, dates of birth), and cases with re-identification risk are excluded.
