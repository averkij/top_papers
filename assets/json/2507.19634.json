            "content": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across wide range of tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Grattafiori et al., 2024), leading to growing interest on extending their capabilities beyond text to embrace multiple modalities such as speech (Rubenstein et al., 2023; Chu et al., 2023) and vision (Alayrac et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023). This shift has given rise to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which aim to unify language, audio, and visual understanding within single framework (Liang et al., 2024). Initially tailored for specific tasks (Li et al., 2023b; Tang et al., 2023), MLLMs are now evolving towards more flexible and generalized usage, where they are expected to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse, complex tasks (Hendrycks et al., 2020). This paradigm, widely known as instruction following, requires models to interpret user instruction with the provided context and generate an appropriate response across one or more modalities (Ouyang et al., 2022; Su et al., 2023; Caffagni et al., 2024). parallel and equally important challenge lies in extending these capabilities to multilingual and crosslingual settings (Hu et al., 2020). General-purpose MLLMs must not only handle inputs and outputs in the same language by supporting the highest possible number of diverse languages, but also process cross-lingual multimodal inputs, such as speech in language paired with an instruction in another language (Zeng et al., 2025). Despite rapid advances in both instruction-following and multilingual modeling (Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021; Barrault et al., 2023), current benchmarks fall short of comprehensively analyzing these aspects. Recent work either focuses exclusively on two modalities, such as vision-text (Fu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2024; Das et al., 2024) or speech-text (Yan et al., 2025; Pandey et al., 2025), or restricts their scope to English (Li et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2024a), thereby overlooking the complexities of multilingual and crosslingual interactions (Duan et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Pernes et al., 2024). Adding to these limitations, current multimodal benchmarks predominantly focus on short-form inputs, neglecting the evaluation of models capabilities with long dependencies (Fu et al., 2024), and only few are human-annotated (Li et al., 2023a), raising concerns about data quality, potential biases, and the overall reliability of model evaluations (Zhang et al., 2024a). To fill this gap, we introduce MCIF, the first manually-curated benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate crosslingual, multimodal instruction-following abilities over both shortand long-form inputs. MCIF covers three core modalitiesspeech, video, and textand spans four typologically diverse languages: English, German, Italian, and Chinese. MCIF supports wide range of tasks, enabling systematic evaluation of MLLMs abilities to follow instructions across different languages and combinations of modalities. The benchmark is released under permissive CC-BY 4.0 license to facilitate broad adoption and further research in this area."

            "content": "Speech-Text Benchmarks. Recent efforts to benchmark instruction-following capabilities in speech-based models have led to the development of several speech-text evaluation datasets. Most of them, such as Speech-ifeval (Lu et al., 2025), SAKURA (Yang et al., 2025b), and MMSU (Wang et al., 2025b), restrict their scope to instruction-following monolingual tasks, predominantly covering the English language. AIR-Bench (Yang et al., 2024), VoiceBench (Chen et al., 2024a), ADUBench (Gao et al., 2024), URO (Yan et al., 2025), and SpeechInstructBench (Wang et al., 2025c) are more dialogue-oriented and introduce open-ended tasks that are limited to English and Chinese, with the latter three benchmarks relying entirely on synthetic TTS speech. SD-Eval (Ao et al., 2024), Dynamic-SUPERB (Huang et al., 2025), AudioBench (Wang et al., 2025a) , MSTEB (Beyene et al., 2025), and SIFT-50M (Pandey et al., 2025) offer multilingual speech-text evaluation but rely on preexisting benchmarks, such as CommonVoice (Ardila et al., 2020), and FLEURS (Conneau et al., 2023), potentially suffering from data contamination (Sainz et al., 2023; Balloccu et al., 2024; Kocyigit et al., 2025), reducing their utility for current models evaluation. Overall, while interest in speech-language evaluation is growing, existing benchmarks do not support multimodal, crosslingual, and long-form instruction-following in unified setting as MCIF. Vision-Text Benchmarks. Similarly to the speech-text domain, the vision-text domain has seen huge increase in the number of benchmarks designed to assess MLLMs across diverse capabilities.

Video-based benchmarks such as Video-Bench (Ning et al., 2023), InfiniBench (Ataallah et al., 2024), VITATECS (Li et al., 2024b), TempCompass (Liu et al., 2024), LVBench (Wang et al., 2024b), MVBench (Li et al., 2024a), and MMBench-Video (Fang et al., 2024) focus on bimodal interactions (video and text), cover English only, and rarely incorporate human-authored multilingual instructions. VideoMME (Fu et al., 2024) and MF2 (Zaranis et al., 2025) represent the first benchmarks comprising the three modalities, but restrict their scope to video understanding only, rather than broader crosslingual instruction-following tasks. As result, there is currently no benchmark that enables systematic evaluation across speech, vision, and text modalities in crosslingual instruction-following framework."

            "content": "Data Selection. To develop multimodal, cross-lingual, multi-task benchmark for scientific communication, we collect scientific talks from the ACL Anthology2, the main reference repository for research in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and language technologies community. This source is particularly well-suited to our objectives. First, it is openly available under CC-BY 4.0 License, permitting unrestricted use and redistribution. Second, it offers naturally multimodal and challenging material: video presentations self-recorded by speakers from various linguistic backgrounds and accents, accompanied by slides, spoken audio, and corresponding research papers. To avoid data contamination issues of testing models on material that has been used for training (Balloccu et al., 2024; Kocyigit et al., 2025), we selected the most recent available material at the time of collection,3 namely, the ACL 2023 paper presentations.4 Data Collection. The presentations were randomly selected across the Long (912) and Short (165) ACL 2023 main conference papers,5 covering different topics in the context of NLP. The resulting benchmark includes 21 presentations, with total of 2 hours of video content and approximately 15.5k words. The video, in mp4 format, is converted with ffmpeg6 into wav audio, mono-channel, 16 kHz. To support both the exploration of how models handle long versus short context and to maximize usability for models with limited context capacity, we provide both the full-length video/speech context and an automatically segmented version generated with SHAS (Tsiamas et al., 2022), with segments averaging 16 seconds in duration. Together with the video, we collect the abstracts, which serve as summaries for the presentations. To improve test set representativeness for summarization tasks, we further collect 79 additional videos, yielding total of 100 samples about 10 hours of content with summaries totaling 17k words. For these additional samples, audio and textual transcripts are also available, ensuring alignment across all three modalities. detailed breakdown of MCIF statistics is provided in Fig. 1. 1As we are dealing with instruction-following models, all tasks involve at least the text modality for the presence of the prompt. Therefore, we include text as modality if the task involves text only. 2https://aclanthology.org/ 3As of April 18th, 2025, the most recent conference having the video presentation available is the one chosen for the benchmark. 4https://aclanthology.org/events/acl-2023/ 5The resulting collection was manually inspected and validated to discard presentations with i) repeated speakers (i.e., each sample represents unique speaker), ii) inaudible or low-quality speech (e.g., presentations with excessive background noise or featuring speaker distant from the microphone), and iii) automatically generated speech (e.g., text-to-speech synthesis is used to produce the audio). 6https://ffmpeg.org/"

            "content": "We detail the dataset curation process, including the creation and design of human gold data across tasks and languages. Key steps are outlined below, with additional information on professional costs, annotation procedures, and task guidelines available in Appendix B. Recognition and Summarization. For each talk, we tasked professional linguists with producing high-quality gold transcripts in US English, following detailed guidelines.7. This enabled the creation of aligned English video, speech, and transcript data. For summarization, instead, we used the abstract from the associated paper as the textual summary, as prior work shows abstracts provide reasonably accurate representations of the scientific talks (Zufle et al., 2025). Question-Answering. To evaluate model understanding, we design QA task intended to probe different aspects of contextual dependency and task realism. First, each talk was paired with at least 10 QA pairs, which followed structured distribution: i) General common questions, which are generic and applicable to any talk (e.g., What are the affiliations of the authors?); ii) Transcript questions, created after watching the full talk and targeting narrow, context-dependent information retrieval; and iii) Abstract questions, generated after reading only the abstract, simulating scenario where user queries about talk without having watched it in its full length. All QA pairs were created and verified by 16 expert annotators8 with background in machine learning and NLP. Each QA pair was also distinguished according to the input modality required to answer the question, explicitly including cases where no answer is available. Labels were assigned as follows: NA if the information was not present in either the video or audio, AV if the information was available in both the audio and video modalities, with either modality alone being sufficient to answer the question, if the answer could be obtained from the audio only, and if it was available in the video only. breakdown of the QA distribution among categories is illustrated in Fig. 1. Overall, this setup enables systematic evaluation of model performance across modality conditions and unanswerable cases, as detailed in Appendix B.2. All QA pairs are created in English and, as described in the following, then translated into three additional languages. Translation and Multilinguality. To enable the creation of cross-lingual benchmark for speech and video-to-text translation, as well as cross-lingual question answering and summarization, all English textual datatranscripts, summaries, and QA pairswere translated into three additional languages: Italian, German, and Chinese.9 These languages were selected as they are well-resourced, allow for comparable analyses, and represent diversity of language (sub)families and writing systems.10 All translations were carried out by professional translators with expertise in scientific content. As translators reviewed the original QA pairs, summaries, and transcripts during this process, translation also served as secondary verification step, further ensuring the quality and consistency of the source material. 3.3 INSTRUCTION-FOLLOWING PROMPTS For each sample in the benchmark, there is no information about the specific task to be performed (e.g., ASR), the input modality (e.g., audio, video, or text), or the target language pair to support (e.g., English to German); rather, the model has to correctly interpret and fulfill diverse instructions across the supported language pairs (e.g., Traduci il contenuto inglese in italiano[it], Translate the English content into Italian[en]). Following previous work, we always specify the source language in the prompt, which is written in the target language (Xu et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024a). We create two subsets of the MCIF benchmark, MCIFfix and MCIFmix, based on the set of prompts. MCIFfix include fixed prompt for each of the task macro-areas (recognition, translation, question answering, and summarization), which maps into the 13 tasks. The full set is reported in Appendix C. Instead, the MCIFmix comprises prompts sampled from list of 10 different prompts for each of the 13 tasks, including the original prompts of MCIFfix. The latter subset is intended to measure the generalization capabilities of the models, as they have to cope with different instructions but 7Linguists are hired via professional agency; details on the process and costs in Appendix B.2. 8They are all students and authors of this paper, with high English proficiency. 9Specifically, Mandarin Chinese, and language variants as spoken in Germany and Italy. 10The selection of these three languages was partly guided by budget constraints and the availability of native-speaking co-authors to supervise the work."

In recognition, SpeechLLMs show strong performance on short-form audio, confirming their specialization in speech transcription tasks. However, performance degrades significantly in the long-form scenario, where the WER increases substantially across all models. Notably, Ola, an MLLM, achieves the best long-form performance by wide margin, outperforming SpeechLLMs and even Phi-4 Multimodal, which still reports WERs above 20. This suggests that Olas architectureparticularly its strategy of chunking and concatenating long speech segments using Whisper-based encoderenables it to maintain transcription quality over extended inputs. Despite this, long-form recognition remains major challenge for most models."

As expected, LLMs dominate in the translation task, benefiting from their strong language modeling and multilingual training. While some SpeechLLMs and MLLMs are competitive on short-form segments, performance deteriorates markedly in the long-form setting. This is especially evident for SpeechLLMs, where we observe drops of up to 30 COMET points in certain languages. The degradation is frequently attributable to undertranslation, where models fail to translate the entire context, which is more pronounced with long-form inputs. QUESTION ANSWERING. This macro-area shows more mixed results, especially in the shortform condition, where best-performing models come from across SpeechLLMs, VideoLLMs, and MLLMs. In particular, SpeechLLMs like Phi4-Multimodal and Qwen2-Audio, as well as MLLMs like Ola and Qwen2.5-Omni, show BERTScores above 30, indicating competitive performance in all languages while Qwen2.5-VL stands out in Chinese. In the long-form setting, Ola and Qwen2.5Omni remain highly competitive, with the Qwen2.5-Omni achieving the best scores in both English and Chinese, likely due to the language distribution in the training set. In contrast to recognition and translation, MLLMs generally improve or maintain performance on long-form question answering, while SpeechLLMs and VideoLLMs experience significant drops, mirroring trends seen in the"

LONG Across tasks, short-form performance is generally stronger, with long-form inSHORT puts introducing clear degradation in most models, particularly SpeechLLMs and VideoLLMs. An exception is Ola in the recognition task, which is the only model showing significant improvement from shortto long-form context inputs of more than 45 WER. manual inspection of the models outputs revealed that Ola occasionally misinterprets transcription prompts in the short-form, opting instead to perform image captioning of accompanying slides, while this is not the case for long-form inputs. For other models, the primary cause of long-form degradation appears to be undertranslation, where only part of the context is translated. Additional failure cases include persistent use of the wrong language (e.g., GraniteSpeech defaulting to English) or refusal to answer the users requests (UltraVox v0.5), independent of context type. MCIFfix MCIFmix. When comparing results between MCIFfix and MCIFmix, we observe consistent degradation across tasks, highlighting the limited robustness of current models to prompt variations. In recognition, the impact is especially pronounced: DeSTA2 and UltraVox degrade by up to 46.6 WER, and even Ola, previously the strongest on long-form, drops by 27 WER. Among MLLMs, MiniCPM-o-2 nearly doubles its WER on short-form, while Qwen2.5-Omni and MingLite-Omni also decline. In translation, LLMs remain relatively stable, though some drops (up to 4 COMET) are observed. SpeechLLMs are less consistent, with models like UltraVox fluctuating by over 10 COMET across languages. Question answering is similarly unstable, with drops up to 6 BERTScore for Phi4-Multimodal and LLaVA-NeXT, though some MLLMs show isolated gains. Summarization . Despite these shifts, Phi4-Multimodal remains the top performer in recognition and translation on short-form and becomes the best model in long-form recognition as Olathe best model on MCIFfixsuffers significant performance drop. In question answering, Qwen2.5-Omni demonstrates strong robustness to prompt variation, especially on long-form, securing two of the four best overall scores. These results reveal that many current models lack robustness to prompt reformulation of MCIFmix, with some tasks amplifying this vulnerability (e.g., recognition)."

MCIF covers three core modalities (text, speech, and video) across four typologically diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese). It includes both shortand long-form contexts, spanning 13 tasks grouped into four macro-areas: recognition, translation, question answering, and summarization. Beyond providing comprehensive evaluation framework for current models abilities, MCIF includes the MCIFmix variant, which introduces distinct prompts across macro-areas, enabling multifaceted assessment of models instruction generalization and robustness. We further present an extensive benchmarking study of state-of-the-art LLMs, SpeechLLMs, VideoLLMs, and MLLMs, highlighting both their current capabilities and significant performance gaps. We believe MCIF lays the groundwork for future progress toward truly general-purpose, multimodal, and crosslingual instruction-following systems."

Professionals were instructed to produce clean, fluent transcripts closely aligned with the original audio while respecting technical jargon, US spelling, and proper punctuation. Disfluencies and background noises were omitted. Translation started from an internal MT system (also internal to the agency and thus confidential), with translators working in the CAT tool MateCat.16 They were free to entirely modify or disregard automatic suggestions to ensure adequacy and fluency. Translators adhered to the transcript formatting and respected language variants (Italian for Italy, German for Germany, Mandarin Chinese). They were instructed not to translate i) original English paper titles, if any, ii) non-English words or expressions that were provided as multilingual examples during the presentation, if any. Native-speaking authors of each target language supervised translations to ensure terminological consistency. B.2 QUESTION-ANSWERING The creation of the QA pairs was carried out by students and authors of this paper, who are all experts in NLP and machine learning. All contributors followed set of detailed instructions, fully available at https://fbk.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/MTUnit/EZKUhrURd_ xOm6V3CvcFmDwBRxb0Tc-44AHQpJJBNwLtMw?e=vWqJhd, which outlined the process and quality criteria for creating and annotating the QA pairs. QA types and distribution. For each talk, annotators were asked to produce at least 10 QA pairs, divided by both the type of question and the type of answer. For question types, each talk required: i) 3 general questions (pre-assigned, the same for all papers), ii) 3 realistic, abstract-based questions, created after reading the abstract, and iii) 4 paper-specific, transcript-based questions. We enforced this distribution to ensure balanced representation of different question types. In all cases, contributors had to annotate each QA pair with timestamp indicating where the answer appeared in the video, and assign label reflecting its source of information: (answerable from audio only), (from video only), AV (from both), or NA (not answerable). target distribution of answer labels was also required for each talk: minimum of 7 A/AV pairs (with at least 5 AV), 2 pairs, and 1 NA pair. If this distribution was not achieved through the existing QAs, additional pairs were created to meet the target. The guidelines, linked above, provided detailed recommendations on how to formulate clear, specific, and concise questions, avoiding vague or multi-part formulations, and ensuring answers directly addressed the question in no more than two sentences. They also included conventions for US spelling and number formatting."
