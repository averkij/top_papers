            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have seen significant advancements, becoming increasingly powerful at processing and generating multimodal content. High-capacity models such as GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024a), Gemini (Gemini, 2024), Phi-3 (Abdin et al., 2024), and Opus (Anthropic, 2024) have demonstrated promising understanding and reasoning abilities, paving the way for building VLMbased agents that can automate computer tasks such as software engineering (Yang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024), web navigation (Zhou et al., 2024b; Koh et al., 2024a) and mobile device control (Rawles et al., 2023; 2024). As many computer tasks require agents to interact with complex environments for long-term objectives, one critical challenge is to reason over extended periods and dynamically explore large decision space. Current models often struggle at accessing wide range of potential actions in these environments, and balancing exploration and exploitation in longhorizon tasks. Even GPT-4o-based agents significantly underperform humans, achieving success rates less than 20% compared to human performance of 89% (Koh et al., 2024a). As demonstrated by OpenAIs o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) and Snell et al. (2024), increasing the number of thinking tokens as chain of thoughts at test time improves accuracy on tasks that require longhorizon planning and reasoning, such as math and coding. This naturally raises the question: Can we scale test-time computation to improve VLMs decision-making capabilities in multistep planning and reasoning for agentic tasks? An intuitive strategy for agentic tasks, such as web navigation, is search. By exploring different actions and evaluating their consequences, models can gain better understanding of the environment, reason about correct actions, and plan more effectively for long-term objectives. Recent work in this direction includes Tree of Thought (Yao et al., 2023a) and Search Agent (Koh et al., 2024b), which rely on best-first search in the form of BFS/DFS and A* search, respectively, to augment the VLMs decision-making process. However, these methods suffer from 1) lack of balance between exploration and exploitation, which is crucial for handling complex tasks, and 2) an inability to learn from past interactions to improve future searches, which humans naturally do. More importantly, these works focus primarily on prompt-based methods and do not address how to transfer knowledge from search back into the model. This results in agents with high inference costs for complex tasks, as it requires the use of VLMs with search algorithms. In this work, we explore how to effectively scale test-time compute to improve VLM agents, and efficiently transfer knowledge and experience acquired from search back to the model to enhance its reasoning and planning abilities. We present EXACT, an approach to combine test-time search and self-learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. First, we introduce our Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS) agent. Our method extends the classic MCTS with two innovations: contrastive reflection to improve search quality in real time using high-quality reflections obtained from past experiences, inspired by conceptual models of human learning (Marton, 2014); and multi-agent debate technique for reliable state evaluation, inspired by collaborative and iterative human evaluation approaches (van der Lee et al., 2019). Second, we propose Exploratory Learning, method to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. In contrast to traditional Imitation Learning which trains the model with the optimal, final actions returned from the search process, Exploratory Learning teaches the models to explore the environment, evaluate state, and backtrack to viable ones using search tree traversals. Experiments on the challenging VisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024a) show that our GPT-4o-based RMCTS agent achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with 6% to 30% relative improvement across various environments compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we find GPT4o trained with Exploratory Learning demonstrates the ability to 1) explore, evaluate, and backtrack without any search augmentation; and 2) recover 87% of the search performance while reducing the inference cost by 2.7x. This represents an important step towards improving VLMs planning and reasoning capabilities for agentic applications by leveraging test-time search and self-learning."

In long-horizon tasks with large action space, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Silver et al., 2017; Swiechowski et al., 2022) is popular method to improve decision making. MCTS explores multiple actions, evaluates their consequences, and returns the best action for execution after conducting large number of simulations. We briefly describe the MCTS algorithm here and refer to Appendix A.1 for more details. Given state to search from, MCTS iteratively constructs tree by: 1) selecting an action to explore/exploit using Upper Confidence Tree Bound (UCT) (Kocsis & Szepesvari, 2006; Rosin, 2011); 2) expanding and evaluating the selected action by simulating the next state (s, a) (s, o) and evaluating current progress; 3) backpropagating the evaluation to update the trees value estimates of quality of the executed action. This search process is repeated until the search budget is exhausted, and the most-visited (Silver et al., 2017) or the highest-value action (Kocsis & Szepesvari, 2006) is returned. click [elem] hover [elem] type [elem] [text] Type text into elem. press [key comb] new tab tab focus [index] tab close goto [url] go back go forward scroll [up/down] stop [answer] Press key combo.

Table 1: Action space for web navigation defined in VisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024a). 2.3 SETUP We now present the setup commonly used by VLMs for agentic tasks, e.g., that of VisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024a). web agent begins by receiving task in natural language (and images) and starting webpage o0. Then, at each time step t: 1) the agent generates an action at based on the last state st, which encodes information from past actions and observations; and 2) at is executed, transiting to new state (st, at) (st+1, ot+1), and observation ot+1 is returned to the agent. This agent-environment interaction continues until either the maximum number of steps is reached, or the agent issues STOP action to terminate the episode. Finally, terminal reward rT {0, 1} is returned based on the final answer or the last environment state sT . In practice, visual agents are often implemented using large vision-language model (VLM) such as GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024a). Common approaches include directly prompting the VLM as policy function to generate an action π() given task and previous actions and observations (Yao et al., 2023b; Koh et al., 2024a); or to additionally construct value functions () and conduct simulation-based searches before returning an action (Yao et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2024a; Koh et al., 2024b). We detail these methods below. VLM as Policy Function Given task and an trajectory τ = {o0, a0, . . . , ..., at1, ot}, policy π(g, τ ) at returns the next action at to execute. Popular methods such as ReACT (Yao et al., 2023b) treat use VLM model as policy by directly prompting it for an action, after optionally generating reasoning step. Then, the environment executes action at and returns new observation ot+1. This process repeats until STOP action is issued or the maximum number of steps is reached. VLM as Value Function To augment an agents decision-making process, many recent works implement value function () to guide the VLM to predict better actions. Given trajectory τ , value function estimates the expected success rate given the current state st. However, since state st of the environment (e.g., including database information) may not always be accessible to the agent, value functions are often implemented using the current observed trajectory τ and the task description instead: (g, τ ) [0, 1]. In this work, we consider two value functions. singleagent value function (Yao et al., 2023a; Koh et al., 2024b) directly prompts VLM with all inputs 3 (task g, trajectory τ ) to generate value estimate vSA: vSA = VLM (g, τ ) [0, 1], and value function based on multi-agent debate, which we describe in the next section."

            "title": "3.1 REFLECTIVE MCTS",
            "content": "Web tasks are highly diverse as different websites have different layouts and functionalities (e.g., Amazon versus Reddit), and almost every webpage is unique. Although search-augmented agents have shown promising results in web navigation tasks, their performance is limited by the complexity of web environments and their inability to quickly adapt to unseen environments. We propose Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), an extension of classic MCTS that improves the agents decision making process on the fly by incorporating reflection over its past task executions, and state estimations using multi-agent-debate (Section 2.3). We present high-level overview of an R-MCTS agent in Figure 2, and pseudo-code description in Appendix A.2. Similarly to classic MCTS, an RMCTS agent during inference predicts an action at by iteratively building search tree that explores the current decision space (i.e., looping over selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation steps). Unlike classic MCTS, RMCTS also iteratively improves the search process by 1) using contrastive reflection to identifying past mistakes/successes; and 2) updating the agents policy and value functions (in-context) to improve its future task executions during inference. This improvement step helps R-MCTS to avoid repeating the same mistakes and to explore more promising actions when faced with similar situations in the future. For clarity, we describe this improvement process in the context of policy reflection, since value reflection is highly similar2. Figure 2: Overview of an R-MCTS Agent. We omit value function reflection for brevity. Contrastive Reflection Policy (or value) function consists of three steps: 1) error attribution; 2) constrastive learning; and 3) memorization of reflection. Given (long-horizon) trajectory τ , this process intuitively corresponds to first identifying the most erroneous action, then analyzing the error by comparing what the agent expected to achieve with what actually happens, and finally storing this knowledge by remembering the task and state where the error occurred. This process is inspired by human cognitive learning (Marton, 2014), where contrasting our mental model of the world with reality serves as an effective way to gather new knowledge. Formally, given task and trajectory τ , we first identify nπ most erroneous actions (and nV value estimates for value reflection) for reflection, based on the difference between the VLMs predicted future success and the search-trees simulated future success Q: errorπ(atτ ) = (ot+1) Q(ot, at), errorV (otτ ) = (ot) Q(ot1, at1). Note that this form of comparing value function and action-value function is similar to Temporal Difference Error used in reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 2018). For each of the erroneous actions {a1, ..., anπ }, we then prompt the VLM to identify reasoning mistakes and gain understanding of navigating in the specific environment. We achieve this by contrastive learning3: 2For value reflection, we reflect on states for erroneous state estimations instead of actions. Then, we prompt the VLM to predict the expected future actions, and generate reflection contrasting the agents actual actions. 3For simplicity, we use the accessibility tree representation of in text modality throughout this process. 4 we first 1) prompt the VLM to predict the expected transition ˆot+1 after executing at, and 2) prompt the VLM to generate reflection by contrasting the current ot, at, the expected ˆot+1 and real ot+1: ˆot+1 = VLMsimulate(g, {o0, a0, ..., ot, at}), reflect(atg, τ ) = VLMreflect(g, ot, at, {ot+1, ˆot+1}). Finally, to help the agent memorize this reflection at test-time, we embed the reflection using the current task and state (g, ot) and store it in vector database. Improvement Then, given new task and new observation (gnew, onew ) to perform inference, we improve the policy (and value) function by 1) retrieving the most relevant reflections using cosine similarity of their embeddings4, and 2) appending them into the agents current context. For clarity, we also illustrate this reflection and improvement process in Figure 6 (Appendix A.2). Multi-Agent Value Function In addition to the reflection-improvement loop, we also experiment with using multi-agent value function to provide more reliable state estimates. Intuitively, this method offers 1) more holistic view of the current state to mitigate mistakes caused by oversights; and 2) stronger reasoning elicited by collaborative/adversarial incentives (Bowman et al., 2022). Formally, multi-agent value function prompts multiple VLMs to each generate value estimate vi, and then aggregate all estimates {v1, v2, ...} to produce final estimate vMA: vi = VLMi (g, τ ) [0, 1] and vMA = aggregate(g, τ, {v1, v2, ...}) [0, 1]. In this study, we implement the multi-agent value function using multi-agent-debate (MAD). Given task and trajectory τ , MAD prompts two VLMs to generate two opposing arguments for the current value estimate (i.e., why the current state is promising/not promising), and then aggregates the two arguments using another VLM to obtain final judgement: aggregate(g, τ, {v1, v2, ...}) = VLMjudge (cid:0)g, τ, {v1, v2, ...}(cid:1) . For the prompts used by contrastive reflection, improvement, and MAD, please refer to Appendix D.2. 3.2 EXPLORATORY LEARNING Search-augmented agents such as R-MCTS improve performance at the expense of increased testtime computation. Using GPT-4o powered R-MCTS as an example, we explore how to teach agents to search and explore at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. We propose Exploratory Learning (EL), learning strategy to teach GPT-4o to explore, evaluate, and backtrackon using all tree traversals that happened during search. This is contrast to the traditional Imitation Learning (IL) approach, which directly fine-tunes GPT-4o on the actions returned by the search algorithm. We illustrate these two methods in Figure 3. Given task g, trajectory τ = {o0, a0, ..., aT }, and all search trees Tree(o0), .., Tree(oT ) obtained during R-MCTS, Imitation Learning trains GPT-4o to learn an improved policy by directly finetuning on the actions executed in τ (i.e., best actions selected by search). This method is simple, but relies on the model itself to learn the implicit reasoning process. Exploratory Learning improves GPT-4os decision making ability by using both τ and tree traversals Tree(o0), .., Tree(oT ). Specifically, given tree Tree(oi), we 1) replay the tree search process5 to obtain observations o, actions explored or backtracked a, and the estimated values v; 2) combine value estimation and action into single action (v, a), and 3) append them to form single trajectory τ . We then repeat this for all trees, and obtain single trajectory τ = {τ } used to train GPT-4o. 0, ..., τ"

            "content": "We experiment on VisualWebArena (VWA), benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal agents performance on across wide range of web navigation tasks and environments. We describe the experimental setup, baselines, and other relevant implementation details below. 4For simplicity, we directly concatenate (gnew, onew ) into single string and feed into an embedding model (text-ada-003-small, OpenAI (2024c)). 5This replay stops at the first time when the search process reached the best action. 5 Figure 3: Given trajectory from R-MCTS, Imitation Learning removes intermediate search trees and directly trains GPT-4o to learn from the final executed actions; Exploratory Learning flattens tree traversals into single trajectory and trains GPT-4o to explore, evaluate, and backtrack. Benchmarks VisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024a) is large-scale benchmark consisting of 910 tasks across three different web environments: Classifieds, Reddit, and Shopping. All tasks in VWA require visual understanding of webpage content to solve effectively, and 25.2% of the tasks also include images as input (e.g., help me make post selling this item + an image of phone). We host all web environments locally and evaluate on all 910 tasks, unless otherwise specified. We follow (Koh et al., 2024a;b) and use Set-of-Mark (Yang et al., 2023b) augmented web screenshots as the agents input. An example is presented in Appendix D.1. Baselines We compare R-MCTS against direct prompting methods as well as search-augmented agents backed by various algorithms. For direct prompting methods, we consider REACT (Yao et al., 2023b), which prompts VLM to generate the reasoning step before generating the action. For search, we consider Tree of Thought (TOT, Yao et al. (2023a), which uses BFS or DFS to explore the decision space and returns the best action found according to ; SEARCH AGENT (Koh et al., 2024b), which is best-first method inspired by A* search; and MCTS (Silver et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2024a; Yu et al., 2023), which uses MCTS to determine the best action to take. Policy and Value Implementation Search methods require policy that can generate up to actions for exploration, and value function that returns value between 0 and 1. We follow Koh et al. (2024b) to implement such policy by 1) sampling up to 20 responses from the VLM with temperature of 1.0 and top-p of 0.95, using nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020); 2) aggregating the counts of each unique action; and 3) returning the top-b actions with the highest counts. We implement the single-agent value function VSA by 1) prompting the VLM with multiple-choice based prompt; 2) sampling 20 responses with temperature of 1.0 and top-p of 0.95; 3) converting the selected choices into numeric value; and 4) returning the average value of all responses. We implement the multi-agent value function VMA by 1) prompting the VLM twice to generate reasons why the current state is promising/unpromising; 2) prompt the VLM again to generate final judgement with multiple-choice-based prompt; and 3) converting the selected choice into numeric value. We use GPT-4o (2024-05-13) (OpenAI, 2024a) as the VLM for all methods as it has been widely used in the development of state-of-the-art agents (Koh et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024) Search Parameters We follow Koh et al. (2024b) to compare all search methods with breadth and depth limit of 5 per tree, and to stop task execution after maximum of 5 actions. Since different algorithms behave differently during search, we also set maximum search time of 5 minutes per state. For MCTS-based algorithms, we use UCT bound with cp = 1.0 for action selection, and use the most-visited child for selecting the best action (Silver et al., 2017). 4.1 R-MCTS RESULTS We summarize the performance of R-MCTS and other search-augmented agents in Table 2. We observe that all search-based methods deliver significant improvements across the VWA environments, albeit with increased test-time compute measured by the number of tokens. Among these methods, MCTS consistently outperforms its counterparts. This is likely due to MCTSs ability to balance 6 Search Value (REACT) TOTBFS TOTDFS SEARCH AGENT MCTS R-MCTS R-MCTS - SA SA SA SA SA MAD Classifieds Reddit Shopping Tokens Success Tokens Success Tokens Success 1x 3.2x 3.1x 4.2x 7.2x 7.3x 7.4x 28.6% 30.7% 30.3% 33.8% 37.6% 40.2% 41.0% 1x 4.7x 4.2x 5.4x 9.5x 7.3x 9.7x 13.8% 19.5% 16.7% 21.9% 23.8% 25.2% 28.7% 1x 4.3x 4.0x 5.1x 8.9x 7.6x 10.1x 23.2% 29.2% 28.3% 30.3% 29.4% 31.9% 32.3% Table 2: Comparing different agents token consumption and performance on VisualWebArena.

Additionally, our R-MCTS agent sets new state-of-the-art performance benchmark across all VWA environments, with relative improvements ranging from 6% to 30% over the previous best-performing method, Search Agent. When using single-agent value function, R-MCTS improves upon MCTS by an average of 2.2 points. Furthermore, with the integration of multiagent debate, R-MCTS achieves an additional 1.6-point improvement on average. These findings highlight promising approach to scaling test-time compute in agentic applications by integrating search, reflection, and multi-agent debate strategies. 4.2 LEARNING RESULTS Next, we evaluate EXACT: teaching GPT-4o to explore and improve its performance using knowledge and experience gained from R-MCTS. Since GPT-4o fine-tuning does not support images6, we evaluate all methods with text-only modality from VWA. We mainly consider training and evaluating on 234 tasks from the Classifieds environment, as GPT-4o finetuning is costly. For simplicity, we refer to R-MCTS with multi-agent-debate value function VMAD as R-MCTSMAD. Training Data We first run R-MCTSMAD on Classifieds, and then sampled 65 trajectories for Imitation Learning according to the estimated values of final success. However, since search tree traversals are typically long, we further remove trajectory that results in more than 20 actions, producing 35 trajectories. We format these data into multi-turn chats, and use OpenAI finetuning API for training. Quantitative Results We present the results in Table 3. First, we find that both Imitation Learning and Exploratory Learning outperform the untrained GPT-4o by large margin without relying on any search algorithm. When compared to R-MCTSMAD, we find that both methods recovered more 6At the time of the study, GPT-4o vision-finetuning was not yet supported. 7 Figure 4: After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o demonstrates the ability to explore, evaluate, and backtrack without augmenting with search algorithms. than 85% of the performance while reducing token usage by up to 4x. We believe this result indicates even strong models like GPT-4o can still significantly benefit from training with agentic data. Qualitative Results With Exploratory Learning, we find that GPT-4o is able to perform better on unseen tasks by performing exploration, state evaluation, and backtracking without relying on any search algorithm. We illustrate an example in Figure 4: after attempting to directly search for coffee maker with touch screen, the Exploratory Learning trained-GPT-4o finds that the search function in Classifieds may be unreliable (top search result is sofa) and backtracked to use category filters instead. 4.3 COMPUTE SCALING RESULTS We explore whether R-MCTSMAD and the fine-tuned model after the self-learning stage has the property of test-time computing scaling, i.e., whether performance can increase when more test-time computes, such search tokens, are allocated. To study this, we follow the same experiment setup in our main results in Section 4.1, but vary the search budget to allow R-MCTSMAD for {2, 5, 10, 15} nodes per search tree. We then compare performance (Success Rate) and token consumption per task compared to REACT (Tokens) in Figure 1a. Since searching with more nodes significantly increases time and cost, we report results by testing on all 234 tasks in the Classifieds environment. As shown in Figure 1, our proposed R-MCTS and Exploratory Learning exhibit strong scaling properties for both train-time and test-time compute. Particularly, in Figure 1 left, we find that RMCTSMAD significantly improves performance when allocated with more test-time compute: using 15 nodes per tree, R-MCTSMAD achieves relative improvement of 66% compared to REACT. Furthermore, Figure 1 right also illustrates that without search, both Imitation Learning and Exploratory Learning substantially boost the performance of an untrained GPT-4o when allowed more actions per task. Notably, Exploratory Learning demonstrates more favorable scaling trend in test-time compute compared to Imitation Learning, as it is trained to learn to search. These results highlight the potential for self-improvement via reflective search and self-learning in agentic applications."

            "content": "5.1 SUCCESS RATE BREAKDOWN In addition to having tasks in different environments, VWA labels these task for action difficulty. These are labeled by estimating the number of steps an average human would take to complete the task: easy (1-3 steps), medium (4-9 steps), and hard (10 steps or more). We evaluate all methods using the same setup as in our main results in Section 4.1. We present the results in Table 4. R-MCTS improves performance across difficulties Compared to prior best, we find R-MCTS agent improved performance by an avearge of 2.5% absolute across all difficulties. This shows that 8 the search and improvement loop in the R-MCTS agent not only benefits planning in long-horizon tasks, but also enhances robustness in solving easier tasks. tasks Multi-Agent-Debate benefits difficult When using multi-agent value function (RMCTSMAD), performance is further improved in medium and hard tasks. We believe this is because multi-agent debate encourages more critical view of the current state, and making it less error-prone in long horizon tasks. However, in easier tasks, we find such method can suffer from over-thinking by trying to avoid non-existent issues, which can slightly reduce performance."

We perform ablation studies for each of component in R-MCTSMAD to understand their contributions to the overall performance. In Table 5, we report the overall performance across all 910 tasks in VWA when removing 1) reflection from value function; 2) reflection from policy; and 3) the search algorithm. We find that reflections for policy improvement are more crucial than reflections for value function, and that search is essential for competitive performance.

We compare against trajectories generated by SEARCH AGENT and analyze errors made by our method. Exploration and Reflection improves action quality Amongst the 80 samples, we find that R-MCTSMAD outperforms SEARCH AGENT in 12.5% of the tasks. We find that this is primarily due to R-MCTSMADs ability to improve its policy (60%) using the reflection-improvement process (Section 3.1); and its ability to balance exploration-exploitation (30%) using UCT instead of best-first. GPT-4o still lacks finegrained image and web understanding In Figure 5, we categorize all errors made by RMCTSMAD during its search process by 1. failing to correctly format the final answer (answer formatting error); 2. errors caused by the agent-environment interaction (environmental error); 3. errors caused by GPT-4os inability to perform finegrained image understanding (model image understanding); and 4. errors caused by GPT-4os limited web understanding/reasoning ability (model web understanding). For more detailed categorization, we refer the reader to Appendix C.1. Our analysis reveals that most of the errors are caused by the backbone VLMs inability to understand the provided webpage screenshot/product images. Examples include failing to correctly identify the item on a-th row and b-th column on shopping page; and misunderstanding that the cheapest product shown on the current page (sorted by most recently listed) is the cheapest product available on the entire site. We believe these model issues are fundamental to many current agents that rely on prompting and suggest that model training (alike Section 3.2) is essential to further improve agents performance.

            "content": "Language-Guided Agents Advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated many recent works to re-purpose LLMs for automating agentic tasks (Nakano et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023; Xi et al., 2023). These methods include prompting LLM directly as policy (Hong et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023b; Sridhar et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023a), as component of manually designed agentic framework (Park et al., 2023; Sumers et al., 2024), combined with manually crafted heuristics/prompt designs to improve performance (Fu et al., 2024; Sodhi et al., 2024), or combined with tool uses for question answering/code generation (Yang et al., 2024; Xia et al., 2024). For tasks that requires visual understanding, many recent work have thus swapped the prompting LLMs to prompting visual language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o (Zheng et al., 2024; Koh et al., 2024a). However, these methods typically suffer in long-horizon tasks that requires planning and error recovery. Our work thus augments VLMs agents with search algorithms such as MCTS (Silver et al., 2017) to complete tasks in complex and realistic web environments. Augmenting Agent with Search/Reflection Using LLMs or VLMs to solve long-horizon tasks such as web navigation is highly challenging task (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024b; Koh et al., 2024a). Many recent work thus also explored various strategies to improve agents decision making process, such as: iteratively prompting the model to improve its own output (Madaan et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023); and augmenting agents decision process using search algorithms such as BFS/DFS (Yao et al., 2023a), best-first search (Koh et al., 2024b), and MCTS (Yu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024a). However, many of these methods primarily focus on text-based environments such as question answering and programming, and do not involve substantial interaction with complex environment. In contrast, our work focuses on 1) conducting MCTS in long-horizon, agentic tasks in realistic web environment; 2) incorporating multi-agent-debate value function to improve state evaluation; and 3) using contrastive reflection to learn from past successes and failures in long execution trajectories. Training Agents Besides improving agents performance at test-time, many works also explored methods to train the backbone LLM/VLM. Examples include Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023), FireACT Chen et al. (2023), AgentInstruct (Zeng et al., 2023), WebGum (Furuta et al., 2024), AutoWebGLM (Lai et al., 2024), and more (Zhang et al., 2024b; Liu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a). These methods rely on collecting human or machine generated trajectories based on direct prompting, and perform supervised training to improve models performance. To our knowledge, we are the first to train GPT-4o using trajectories produced by MCTS, and to teach GPT-4o to explore, evaluate, and backtrack in complex web environments through training on MCTS tree traversal."

            "content": "In this work, we first introduced R-MCTS agent, search-augmented agent powered by 1) MCTS to explore, evaluate, and backtrack in complex and realistic web environments; 2) multi-agent-debate value function for reliable state evaluation; and 3) contrastive reflection to learn from past successes and failures in long execution trajectories. Then, we proposed methods to transfer knowledge acquired from search back to GPT-4o by 1) training on best actions returned by tree search (Imitation Learning); and 2) training on the entire MCTS tree traversal (Exploratory Learning). Experiments on the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark show that R-MCTS achieves new state of the art, and that our finetuned GPT-4o agent begins to display test-time compute scaling properties similar to search algorithms. We believe our work presents promising direction to combine test-time search and model self-learning to develop the next-generation autonomous agents."

            "content": "High cost of scaling test-time compute Although MCTS-based agents achieve strong performance on benchmarks such as VWA, they consume nearly 10x more tokens compared to REACT. This presents clear trade-off between performance and cost/time, and may limit the practicality of deploying such agents in real-world applications. However, these search-augmented agents can be used to curate training data for VLMs without human labels, which can in turn help develop 10 stronger VLMs. Our work presents promising step in this direction using Imitation Learning and Exploratory Learning, and we believe such self-learning loop is crucial to build stronger agents. Long trajectories from tree traversal In long-horizon tasks, R-MCTS agents require large amount of simulation to identify optimal actions, resulting in long tree traversals. Training on these long traversals can be costly, and may be difficult for models to learn from. Nevertheless, we believe this issue can be iteratively mitigated by using self-learning to improve model capability, and by conducting search using the improved policy/value functions. We leave explorations for future work."

We use the same MCTS search implementation for all relevant methods (MCTS, R-MCTS, and RMCTSMAD agent). For clarity, we abuse the notation to represent observations in this section, in order to comply with notations used in other works ( Swiechowski et al., 2022). Algorithm 1 MCTS arg maxa Q(scurr, a) + (scurr, a) scurr (scurr, a) τcurr τcurr {a, scurr} scurr τcurr τ // selection while scurr is not leaf node do Require: VLM policy π(g, τ ) Require: VLM value (g, τ ) Require: environment Require: goal and current observation Require: actual trajectory so far τ (before s) 1: while search budget is not exhausted do 2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: end while 20: // prediction 21: arg maxa (s, a) 22: return end while // expansion {a1, a2, ..., aN } π(g, τcurr) // evaluation (g, τcurr) // back-propagation while scurr = do end while scurr parent(scurr, acurr) update Q, using with Equation (2) During selection, we follow Silver et al. (2017) and use variant of PUCT (Rosin, 2011) to balance exploration and exploitation: (s, a) = cp (as) (cid:112)(cid:80) (s, b) 1 + (s, a) (1) where cp is hyperparameter controlling the exploration rate, (as) is the VLMs prior probability of generating action in state s, and (s, a) is the state visit count. We use cp = 1.0 in our experiments. During evaluation, we prompt the VLM as value function using the process described in Section 2.3. During back-propagation, we update the search trees action-value estimate and visitation count using running average: Q(s, a) Q(s, a) + Q(s, a) (s, a) 15 ; (s, a) (s, a) + 1.

For clarity, we also abuse the notation to represent observations in this section, in order to comply with notations used in other works ( Swiechowski et al., 2022). We omitted details about action selection, expansion, simulation, and back-propagation as they are described in Appendix A.1. We present the main loop in R-MCTS 16 Figure 6: In-context reflection-improvement loop for an R-MCTS agent. For brevity, we only present policy reflection, as value reflection is similar. Left: after complete episode, the agent 1) uses search tree statistics to select the most erroneous action at from τ to reflect on; 2) prompts the VLM to generate reflection by contrasting what it expects to achieve ˆot+1 and what actually happens ot+1; 3) embeds the reflection in vector database. Right: to generate an action in new task, the agent 1) retrieves most relevant reflections from the database; 2) improves its policy (and value function) using in-context learning. which consists of 1) an inference loop where the agent conducts tree search to find the best action for given state; and 2) an improvement loop where the agent reflects on its past actions, and updates its policy and value function in-context using retrieval for future tasks. We detail the reflection and update process below. Contrastive Reflection We present the pseudo code for both policy contrastive reflection and value contrastive reflection in Algorithm 3 and Algorithm 4, respectively, and illustrate the reflection-update process in Figure 6. This reflection process is repeated for nπ times per trajectory for the top-nπ erroneous actions during policy reflection, and nV times for value function reflection. We use nπ = 3 and nV = 1 in our experiments. We use text-ada-003-small (OpenAI, 2024c) as the embedding model. For clarity, we repeat the error attribution equations in Section 3.1 below: errorπ(atτ ) = (ot+1) Q(ot, at), errorV (otτ ) = (ot) Q(ot1, at1). (3) Improvement Given new task and trajectory τ = {o0, a0, ..., ot}, we retrieve the = 2 most relevant reflections from the database, and use them to improve the policy and value function by appending them into the existing context (see Appendix D.2 for the prompt template). The retrieval process is done by computing the cosine similarity between the current task and observation embedding(g, ot) and the keys stored in the vector database. Since many tasks/webpages are unique, we also set minimum similarity threshold of 0.25 to only use relevant reflections."

            "content": "B.1 WEB BROWSER Search-augmented agents require frequent backtracking to explore new actions. As result, we find prior implementations of the web browser is inefficient and error prone: 1) all processing is done in single thread sequentially; 2) every (backtracked) page is re-processed from scratch; and 3) can frequently cause action element id mismatch errors since backtracked page may not always be the same as before (e.g., search history is stored in the websites database and cannot be reset). We thus modified the existing web browser used in Koh et al. (2024b), and used the same modified browser for all methods in our experiments. Our modifications include: 1. use asyncio to parallelize webpage processing (Asyncio); 2. implement caching mechanism to store and retrieve SoM processing output when the same webpage is encountered (Caching); 3. when SoM element ids changed after backtracking, we implement simple heuristic (word overlap of some metadata associated with the element) to re-map the VLM generated action id back to the correct element id (Action Re-mapping). We present quantitative study of these changes in Table 6. B.2 VWA EVALUATION One common error we find with GPT-4o based agents (e.g., using REACT) is to directly return the (correct) items name and description from (e.g.,) the search result page, while VWA evaluates these tasks by checking if the final states URL is the desired items URL. However, we believe this is due to ambiguously phrased task intent, such as Find me the cheapest blue kayak on this site, and Find the most expensive car from Virginia that is neon green, which does not explicitly mention/require navigating to the items page to complete. To this end, we updated these task instructions by appending the sentence: Finish the task by navigating to that items page and returning me the url link(s) to these tasks for clarity. This change affected 93 instances in the Classifieds environment, 0 instance in the Reddit environment, and 34 instances in the Shopping environment. We present quantitative study of this change in Table 7, and find that all methods/VLMs significantly improved by simply aligning the task intent with the evaluation metric. Unless otherwise specified, we use these updated task intents for all methods and experiments in this work."

Answer Formatting Answer formatting errors include: 1) returning the items name/description instead of its URL used for evaluation, or failing to format range of prices into the instructed format (URL/product detail formatting error). Environmental Errors Environmental errors include: 1) incompatibility issues with certain website functionality (e.g., dropdown menu) with SoM augmentation (environment/representation error); and 2) ambiguous task intents leading to more than one potentially correct answer, one of which the model returned (potential evaluation error). Model Image Understanding Model image understanding errors include: 1) failing to correctly identify certain properties (e.g., color, pattern, material, etc.) from an image (image details); 2) failing to identify product on the i-th row and/or j-th column (image position); and 3) generating an action with element ID not present on the current observation (selected wrong SoM id). Model Web Understanding Model web understanding errors include: 1) forgetting to sort search results and misunderstands the most expensive/cheapest item on the current page is also the most expensive/cheapest item on the entire website (forgot to sort search results); and 2) other errors potentially caused by lack web common-sense knowledge, such as trying to filter for price ranges by typing in the search bar instead of using price filters, and returning related items on other pages when specifically instructed to find it on the current page (significant web common-sense error). 19 Figure 8: Example Set-of-Mark augmented webpage used as inputs for VLM agents."
