            "content": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale and generalize (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), understanding their internal computations becomes increasingly imperative. Mechanistic interpretability seeks to unravel how neural networks generate outputs by dissecting their internal processes into human-interpretable components (Bereska & Gavves, 2024). Such comprehension is crucial not only for aligning LLMs with human values (Ji et al., 2023) but also for preventing undesirable behaviors such as the generation of toxic content (Hendrycks et al., 2023). 4 2 0 2 5 ] .

This arises from the superposition hypothesis, which suggests that neural networks represent more features than there are neurons by encoding them in compressed, high-dimensional spaces (Elhage et al., 2022). To address polysemanticity, observational analyses leveraging sparse representations have been employed. Specifically, techniques like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle these superposed features by learning sparse, overcomplete bases that describe the activation space (Sharkey et al., 2022; Bricken et al., 2023; Cunningham et al., 2024).

Such deviation is further exacerbated as nonzero reconstruction error cascades through the LLMs hidden representations (Gurnee, 2024). (2) Manipulability and performance trade-offs: While attempts have been made to steer LLMs based on learned dictionary features (Marks et al., 2024; Templeton, 2024), discussions on the manipulability of SAEs often overlook their impact on the models general performance across other tasks. Particularly in open-ended generation tasks, the effects of feature control using SAEs remain largely unknown. These limitations highlight the necessity for alternative methods that can observe LLMs internal processes while preserving their original capabilities. In light of these challenges in post-hoc interpretation, methods encoding interpretable weights in LLM during pretraining have been introduced (Tamkin et al., 2023; Hewitt et al., 2023). Among those prior approaches, integrating sparse dictionary learning with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures is considered promising as experts specialization is linked with monosemanticity (Gao et al., 2024; Fedus et al., 2022a;b). However, conventional MoE architectures face several problems: (1) Limited number of experts: Most sparse LLMs employ limited number of experts (Lepikhin et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022b; Jiang et al., 2024), leading to knowledge hybridity where each expert covers diverse and unrelated concepts (Dai et al., 2024), failing to fulfill the superposition hypothesis necessary for monosemanticity. (2) Confinement to specific layers: Attempts to scale the number of experts (dos Santos et al., 2024; He, 2024) have been confined to specific layers within the LLM, rendering knowledge distributed in other parts of the network (Dai et al., 2022; Geva et al., 2021) inaccessible. (3) Inefficient parameter scaling: Recently proposed architectures aiming to scale the number of experts (He, 2024; Oldfield et al., 2024) suffer from linearly increasing total parameters, limiting the scalability of the LLM. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIXTURE OF MONOSEMANTIC EXPERTS FOR TRANSFORMERS (MONET) architecture, enabling effective specialization of experts to facilitate mechanistic interpretability in LLMs. MONET aims for transparent language modeling by significantly increasing the number of experts to 262K at every layer and integrating sparse dictionary learning within end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts training. Our main contributions are as follows: Parameter-efficient architecture with increased number of experts: By utilizing novel expert decomposition method, MONET addresses memory constraints, ensuring that the total number of parameters scales proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Mechanistic interpretability via monosemantic experts: MONET facilitates mechanistic interpretability by enabling observations of fine-grained experts routing patterns. Our analyses confirm mutual exclusivity of knowledge between groups of experts, while qualitative examples demonstrate individual experts parametric knowledge. Robust knowledge manipulation without performance trade-offs: MONET allows for end-to-end training that extends to robust knowledge manipulation during inference. Without degrading performance, it provides effortless control over knowledge domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation."

Based on the product key algorithm introduced by Lample et al. (2019), PEER implements the product key retrieval mechanism that enables efficient search of top-k experts, reducing computational complexity from O(N d) to O(( + k2)d). Specifically, each PEER expert is minimal MLP (multilayer perceptron) consisting of an input layer, single hidden neuron, and an output layer. PEER uses two independent product keys, which j=1 Rd/2 for each head h, rather than are expert embeddings, {w1 retrieving the experts among embeddings. The hidden state is correspondingly split into two halves, x1, x2 Rd/2, and the top-k experts are obtained by: i=1 Rd/2 and {w2 hj} hi} K1 = Tk({(w hi)T x1} i=1 ) and K2 = Tk({(w2 hj)T x2} j=1). (3) Then, top-k experts are selected from the scores computed over the Cartesian product K1 constitute Kh, i.e., K2 h, to Kh = Tk({(w1 hi)T x1 + (w2 hj)T x2 : (i, j) h K2 h}), (4) with gh = softmax({(w1 hj)T x2 : (i, j) Kh}) being routing scores of the experts. Following the format of Equation 1, let Eij(x) be the (i, j)th expert network and uij, vij Rd be weights of the expert MLPs. The PEER layer is then formulated as: hi)T x1 + (w2 PEER(x) = (cid:88) (cid:88) ghijEij(x) = (cid:88) (cid:88) h= (i,j)Kh h=1 (i,j)Kh ghijvijσ(uT ijx).

            "content": "To disentangle superposed features in LLM by incorporating sparse dictionary learning into end-toend SMoE pretraining, we aim to maximize the number of experts. Instead of searching through 3 Under review as conference paper at ICLR 2025 large pool of standalone experts using product key retrieval, we propose product key composition of experts by sharding layers in individual experts to overcome PEERs memory constraints. Our orthogonal layer partitioning methods, horizontal and vertical decompositions, address the memory bottleneck by scaling the number of experts while keeping parameter growth proportional to the square root of the expert count. Horizontal Expert Decomposition (HD) Our first approach to product key composition fundamentally redefines how expert networks are constructed. Instead of maintaining complete expert networks as defined in Equations 1 and 5, we decompose each expert into two complementary components: bottom and top linear layers. Such partitioning scheme allows us to build experts dynamically during inference by combining these components. Specifically, we partition the weights of experts into two distinct groups corresponding to the bottom j=1 Rdm respectively, where represents the expert and top layers: {Ui} hidden dimension (e.g., = 1 for PEER). To accommodate architectures with bias terms (Shen j=1 Rd in our formulation. The composed i=1 Rm and {b2 et al., 2024), we include {b1 } } expert network can then be expressed as: i=1 Rmd and {Vj} N Eij(x) = Vjσ(Uix + b1 where (i, j)-th expert is formed by combining the i-th bottom layer with the j-th top layer. ) + b2 , (6) weight choices from each group (0 i, < As illustrated in Figure 1, this decomposition enables constructing unique experts using only ). Unlike PEER, which searches for top-k experts among k2 candidates, we directly use the Cartesian product Kh = K1 h, which breaks down joint (i, j) pairs into independent and selections. The resulting SMoE layer with horizontal decomposition is defined as: K2 MoHDE(x) = (cid:88) (cid:88) ghijEij(x) h=1 (i,j)Kh (cid:88) = (cid:88) (cid:88) hig2 g1 hj (cid:0)Vjσ(Uix + b1 ) + b2 (cid:1) (7) (8) h=1 hi)T x1}iK1 iK1 ) and g2 jK2 = softmax({(w2 hig2 h hj)T x2}jK2 h= softmax({(w1 where g1 pendently for each group, with their product ghij = g1 ) are computed indehj determining the experts routing score. To optimize computation across tokens with our decomposed expert structure, we address key challenge: sparse activations varying by token complicate efficient computation reorganization. While traditional SMoE models employ expert parallelism (Fedus et al., 2022b; Du et al., 2022), such strategies become impractical with our 262K composed experts. Following Pan et al. (2024); Puigcerver et al. (2023), we adopt dense routing to enable precomputation of overlapped layer operations by extending sparse routing scores to all experts: (cid:26)g1 hi 0 if K1 otherwise if K2 otherwise (cid:26)g2 hj 0 ˆg2 hj = ˆg1 hi = and (9) . This allows us to reorganize Equation 8 into more computationally efficient form: MoHDE(x) = = = (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) hiˆg2 ˆg1 hj (cid:0)Vjσ(Uix + b1 ) + b2 (cid:1) hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjVjσ(Uix + i ) + (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjb2 h=1 (cid:88) i=1 j=1 (cid:88) Vj ˆg2 hj (cid:88) j=1 h=1 i=1 hiσ(Uix + b1 ˆg1 ) + h=1 (cid:88) i=1 j=1 (cid:88) b2 ˆg2 hj. j=1 h=1 (10) (11) (12) By strategically reordering the summations in Equation 12, we can precompute memory-intensive operations before and after the expert routing phase. We provide implementation details in Algorithm 1 of Appendix A.3. 4 Under review as conference paper at ICLR 2025 Vertical Expert Decomposition (VD) As an orthogonal approach to horizontal decomposition, we propose vertical decomposition that partitions each expert network along the vertical dimension Rd/2m/2 represent Rm/2d and 11 into left and right segments. Let 1 Rd/2 denote the , b22 the vertically splitted weights for the experts, and b11 split biases. For the vertically decomposed experts, the expert network is defined as: 12 22 , 22 Rm/2 and b12 , b21 (cid:18)(cid:20)U 1 2 (cid:20)V 11 21 (cid:20)b11 b21 (cid:20)b12 b22 Eij(x) = , 2 , 21 , 12 (13) + (cid:21)(cid:19) + σ (cid:21) (cid:21) (cid:21) , and the expert layer is obtained as: (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) MoVDE(x) = h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h=1 i=1 j=1 = hiˆg2 ˆg1 hj (cid:18)(cid:20)V 11 21 V 12 22 (cid:21) σ (cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:20)U 1 2 + (cid:21)(cid:19) (cid:20)b11 b21 + (cid:20)b12 b22 (cid:21)(cid:19) hiˆg2 ˆg1 hj (cid:34)V 11 σ(U 1 σ(U 1 21 + b11 + b11 ) + 12 ) + 22 σ(U 2 σ(U 2 + b21 + b21 ) + b12 ) + b22 (cid:35) . (14) (15) We divide the layer calculation into six terms (see Equation 15), with the complete derivation presented in Appendix A.1. The overall computational cost is equivalent to horizontal decomposition, and the implementation details are provided in Algorithm 2 of Appendix A.3. Adaptive Routing with Batch Normalization To avoid the hardware inefficiency of top-k sorting, we use Batch Normalization to estimate expert routing quantiles without performing top-k. Inspired by BatchTopK (Bussmann et al., 2024), which enhances reconstruction in SAE, we apply batch-level quantile estimation for more accurate routing. Batch Normalization automatically gathers router logit statistics, which are used during inference. This method reduces training time while maintaining performance. Load Balancing Loss Load balancing loss is crucial in MoE models to promote uniform expert routing, improving expert utilization and ensuring efficient parallelism when experts are distributed across devices. While sparse routing mechanisms are widely used, some dense MoE models adopt entropy-based losses (Pan et al., 2024; Shen et al., 2023) since dense routing does not directly track expert selection frequencies. In similar vein, we introduce an alternative uniformity loss, formulated as the KL divergence between uniform distribution and the routing probabilities: Lunif = 1 2H (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 i=1 log ˆg1 hi 1 2H (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 j=1 log ˆg2 hj. (16) Additionally, we introduce an ambiguity loss that measures the degree of expert specialization for each token: Lamb = 1 2H (cid:0)1 max g1 (cid:1) 1 2H (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) h= (cid:0)1 max g2 (cid:1) . (17) This loss encourages the model to assign each token to specific expert with high confidence. By minimizing this ambiguity loss, the model promotes expert specialization, resulting in more distinct and interpretable expert roles. Ablations study on load balancing loss is presented in Appendix C.1. Let LLM be language modeling loss and λ be hyperparameter. The final training objective is: = LLM + λLunif + λLamb. (18)"

On the other hand, SAEs fall short in maintaining model stability, where reconstruction errors lead to instability and reduced performance in open-ended tasks, compromising the models overall reliability in knowledge control. We evaluate Gemma 2 2B (Team et al., 2024) using Gemma Scope (Lieberum et al., 2024), collection of SAEs trained on Gemma 2 models. Specifically, we employ the available SAEs with 65K sparse featuresboth those reconstructing the LLMs MLP output and those reconstructing residual layersand evaluate their performance on open-ended benchmarks. The scalability of MONET is evident across all three parameter scales (850M, 1.4B, and 4.1B). As the number of parameters increases, the model exhibits consistent upward trend in performance across both 0-shot and 5-shot settings. This confirms that the scaling laws typically observed in dense models still apply to MONETs sparse architecture, further reinforcing its scalability and practical applicability for large-scale LLM deployments. In terms of the decomposition design choice, vertical decomposition (VD) shows superior performance over horizontal decomposition (HD).

Figure 2: Activated tokens for experts in LLMs (MONET-1.4B, MONET-4.1B) on C4 validation dataset. CODEMONET-1.4Bs examples were collected from the StarCoder dataset. Tokens are sorted according to the experts routing score (or ghij in Eq. 7), notated in parenthesis. Descriptions in bottom rows are self-explained experts, generated from the automated interpretation framework. Parametric Knowledge In MONET, feedforward MLP in each decoder block is decomposed into 262,144 experts, design considered highly granular by the standard of Ludziejewski et al. (2024). As shown in Figure 2, such fine-grained experts specialize in concepts such as chemical compounds (Expert 147,040) or states in the U.S. (Expert 73,329). An expert activates to vocabularies associated with similar concepts, like physicists in field of electromagnetism (Expert 81,396). Expert Monosemanticity Our experts exhibit monosemanticity by specializing in concepts presented across different contexts and languages, demonstrating that they recognize based on contextual and domain knowledge rather than relying solely on vocabulary cues. For instance, both Expert 48,936 and Expert 54,136 in Figure 2 respond to the term Bay, where one relates it to geographical area (e.g.,Bay Area), and the other connects it to mathematical concept (e.g., Bayesian). Similarly, despite the appearance of the same concept across various programming languages, CODEMONET consistently maps string-related knowledge to Expert 52,338. Self-explained Experts We have adapted automated interpretation framework that generates the description based on the hidden states in LLMs (Chen et al., 2024; Ghandeharioun et al., 2024; Kharlapenko et al., 2024), to interpret individual experts as shown in Figure 2. The following prompt is given to the MONET-1.4B CHAT: Q: What is the meaning of the word X? A: Sure! The meaning of the word is , where serves as placeholder for averaged token embeddings activated to the targeted expert. Without relying on external LLMs, our MONET-1.4B CHAT generates description for its experts, like explaining the Expert 232,717 as Cartilage and the Expert 51 as Expertise. 7 Under review as conference paper at ICLR 2025 (a) MONET (Ours) (b) Gemma Scope (c) OLMoE (d) LLAMA Figure 3: Knowledge unlearning and accuracy perturbation across 14 MMLU domains.

            "content": "Using the MMLU Pro (Wang et al., 2024) benchmark taxonomy, which divides question-answer sets into 14 distinct domains, we investigated the effects of domain-specific knowledge unlearning on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021). For each expert, if the routing probability for particular domain was at least twice as high as for the second most activated domain, we labeled that expert as specialized in that domain. After assigning experts to domains, we selectively deleted the experts and evaluated the impact of knowledge unlearning across all 14 domains. The details of the expert deletion process and its impact across the 14 domains are provided in Appendix D.1. 8 Under review as conference paper at ICLR 2025 Language Python C++ Java JavaScript Lua PHP Target Others Python -30.6 -0.9 +0.6 -1.6 -2.9 -0. -30.6 -1.1 C++ -3.5 -15.2 -2.0 -0.9 -0.7 -2.1 -15.2 -1.8 Java -5.3 -0.4 -20.4 -2.6 -0.7 +0.2 -20.4 -1.8 JavaScript -0.2 -0.6 -1.9 -9.1 -1.4 -3. -9.1 -1.4 Lua -1.1 -0.2 +1.7 -1.1 -15.7 -2.5 -15.7 -0.6 PHP -3.0 -0.3 -0.4 +0.5 -2.0 -26.6 -26.6 -1.1 Table 3: Knowledge unlearning and pass@100 metric changes across programming languages in the MULTIPL-E benchmark. In this evaluation, experts assigned to the target language are deleted, while others are preserved. Columns represent the independent variable where the masking is applied on. The Target row represent the delta in pass@100 performance of the MONET model following expert removal for the specified language. The Others row shows the average pass@100 performance change of the others. Dark pixels indicate high sensitivity to the expert purging. Figure 3 demonstrates that MONETs knowledge unlearning primarily affects the targeted domain while preserving the performance of the other domains. We compared our approach with three baseline methods: Gemma 2 LLM with Gemma Scope, which utilizes 262K sparse SAE features matching MONETs expert count; OLMoE (Muennighoff et al., 2024), standard MoE architecture with 1.3B active and 6.9B total parameters; and LLAMA 1.3B with GELU activation, sized equivalently to MONET, where we leverage MLP layers for knowledge identification inspired by Meng et al. (2022). Using domain-specific assignment criteriaSAE logit values for Gemma Scope and first-layer MLP outputs for LLAMAwe performed knowledge unlearning across all methods. The results demonstrate MONETs superior performance in domain-specific knowledge manipulation compared to baseline approaches. While MONET achieves precise knowledge unlearning within targeted domains, Gemma Scope suffers from broader performance degradation due to incomplete reconstruction through the SAE layer. Both OLMoE and LLAMA face fundamental limitations from feature polysemanticity. In OLMoE, there were no specialized experts in any domains in MMLU, based on our criteria of skewness in expert routing score. OLMoEs experts routing score was evenly distributed, making it difficult to detect specialized experts. We leveraged criteria of occurrences in maximum activation to determine the experts domain specialization. In contrast, LLAMA displays an average 6% of neurons to be specialized in each domain compared to MONETs 2.2%, suggesting possible feature entanglement and resulting in significant performance degradation across unrelated domains during knowledge removal."

For the targeted languages, pass@100 scores dropped by as much as -30%p, while average performance for other languages remained relatively stable, with only minor declines ranging from -0.6% to -1.8%p.

For toxicity evaluation, we utilize the PERSPECTIVE API (Lees et al., 2022) for REALTOXICITYPROMPTS and the ToxiGen RoBERTa model for the ToxiGen benchmark, both designed to measure the generation of toxic content.

Based on predefined thresholds, we removed experts with high toxicity correlations. Examples of toxic experts are presented in Figure 5 of Appendix D.3. By removing these experts, LLM alters its behavior to generate detoxified content, as demonstrated in Figure 6. As presented in Table 4, our results show that eliminating up to 4.1% of experts can reduce both the expected maximum toxicity and the probability of generating toxic content without affecting performance in REALTOXICITYPROMPTS. Similarly, Table 5 demonstrates that MONET effectively lowers toxicity with only minimal performance degradation, consistent with the findings from REALTOXICITYPROMPTS."

Lower threshold indicate stricter criteria to filter out more experts. Average performance (helpfulness) is measured in 8 open-ended LLM tasks. Specifics of the helpfulness can be found in Appendix E. We introduced MONET, an SMoE architecture with 262,144 experts designed to address the challenge of polysemanticity in LLMs. By integrating sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end SMoE pretraining, MONET overcomes the limitations associated with the post-hoc reconstruction loss of SAEs. Our novel product key composition alleviates the memory constraints of conventional SMoE architectures, allowing the expert count to scale to 262,144 per layer while ensuring that total parameters grow proportionally to the square root of the expert count. This substantial expansion enables fine-grained specialization, resulting in monosemantic experts that capture mutually exclusive aspects of knowledge. We demonstrated that MONET enhances mechanistic interpretability by facilitating transparent observations of expert routing patterns and individual expert behaviors. Moreover, MONET allows for robust manipulation of knowledge across domains, languages, and in mitigating toxicity, all without degrading the models general performance. Our findings suggest that scaling the number of experts and fostering monosemantic specialization within LLMs hold significant promise for advancing both interpretability and controllability, paving the way for future research into transparent and aligned language models. Limitations Regarding expert selection, we observed that the skewness of routing scores can determine the domain specialization of experts, and we identified toxic experts by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between toxicity scores and routing scores. We acknowledge that these criteria are basic and minimal, and we believe that developing more advanced expert selection methods is promising direction for future research. Additionally, we should explore automated interpretation techniques as self-explained experts are currently demonstrated only qualitatively, remaining quantitative evaluation on automated interpretability an open question. Finally, our application of parametric knowledge manipulation is limited to knowledge unlearning. We believe that observations on monosemantic experts can help address research questions related to hallucinations (e.g., Is the model confident in retrieving internal knowledge?) and lifelong learning in SMoE LLMs, which is expected to be promising field (Chen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). 10 Under review as conference paper at ICLR"

            "content": "A.1 EXPANSION OF VERTICAL DECOMPOSITION In this section, we derive the rearrangement of Equation 15 for the vertical decomposition, aligning it with Equation 12 from the horizontal decomposition. We achieve this by splitting the result into six terms to facilitate the computation of actual values. The vertically decomposed expert layer (MoVDE) is expressed as: MoVDE(x) = = = (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h= i=1 j=1 hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjEij(x) hiˆg2 ˆg1 hj (cid:18)(cid:20)V 11 21 V 12 22 (cid:21) σ (cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:20)U 1 2 + (cid:21)(cid:19) (cid:20)b11 b21 (cid:21)(cid:19) + (cid:20)b12 b22 hiˆg2 ˆg1 hj (cid:20)V 11 σ(U 1 σ(U 1 21 + b11 + b11 ) + 12 ) + 22 σ(U 2 σ(U 2 + b21 + b21 ) + b12 ) + b22 (cid:21) . (19) (20) (21) Based on the above equation, we define the block matrices: X11 = X13 = X22 = (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h=1 i=1 j=1 ˆg1 hiˆg hjV 11 σ(U 1 + b11 ), X12 = hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjb12 , X21 = hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjV 22 σ(U 2 + b21 ), X23 = (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h= i=1 j=1 ˆg1 hiˆg2 hjV 12 σ(U 2 + j ), hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjV 21 σ(U 1 + b11 ), hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjb22 . Using these terms, we can simplify the output of the MoVDE layer as the full matrix X. Similar to the horizontal decomposition, we can reorder the summations in each term to enhance computational efficiency by precomputing and reusing intermediate results, thereby eliminating redundant expert computations. Specifically, since the MLPs consist of two layers, we consider four combinations of the expert weights: (i, i), (i, j), (j, i), and (j, j). Straightflow First, we address the computations involving the same index pairs, (i, i) and (j, j), represented by X11 and X22. These computations can be simplified as follows: (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) X11 = hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjV 11 σ(U 1 + i ) = (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 j=1 (cid:32) (cid:88) (cid:33) ˆg1 hi = σ(U 1 11 + b11 ), i=1 h= j=1 i=1 (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) (cid:88) X22 = hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjV 22 σ(U 2 + b21 ) = (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i= j=1 (cid:32) (cid:88) (cid:33) ˆg2 hj j=1 h= = σ(U 2 22 + b21 ). j=1 h= i=1 ˆg1 hiV 11 σ(U 1 + b11 ) ˆg hjV 22 σ(U 2 + b21 ) ˆg2 hj ˆg1 hi (22) (23) (24) (25) In these terms, the expert computations 11 ) can be precomputed before aggregating the outputs. Moreover, the multi-head expert routing probabilities are consolihi and (cid:80)H dated into single routing coefficients (cid:80)H hj, reducing redundant aggregations. ) and σ(U 2 σ(U 1 x+b21 x+b11 h=1 ˆg2 h=1 ˆg 17 Under review as conference paper at ICLR 2025 Crossflow For the cross terms X12 and X21, the computations involve interactions between different indices. These crossflows between (i, j) and (j, i) can be handled similarly to the horizontal decomposition, as mentioned in Equation 12. We rewrite these terms as: X12 = X21 = (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h=1 i=1 j=1 hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjV 12 σ(U + b21 ) = hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjV 21 σ(U 1 + i ) = (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h= (cid:88) ˆg1 hi ˆg2 hj 12 21 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) h=1 i=1 hjσ(U 2 ˆg2 + b21 ) (26) hiσ(U 1 ˆg1 + b11 ). (27) The expressions suggest that the activations σ(U 2 ) are precomputed before aggregating expert outputs. The second-layer weights 12i and 21j are applied in the final step, allowing efficient summation over routing probabilities ˆg1 ) and σ(U x+b21 x+b11 hi and ˆg2 hj. Bias Terms The bias terms X13 and X23 can be simplified as: (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) h=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 (cid:88) X13 = X23 = hiˆg2 ˆg1 hjb12 = ˆg1 hiˆg hjb22 = (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) (cid:88) h= (cid:88) b12 b22 ˆg1 hi (cid:88) ˆg2 hj = j=1 (cid:88) ˆg2 hj ˆg1 hi = h= i=1 j=1 j=1 h=1 i=1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:88) j=1 b12 b22 (cid:33) ˆg1 hi (cid:33) ˆg2 hj , . (cid:32) (cid:88) h= (cid:32) (cid:88) h=1 (28) (29) These terms depend only on the respective expert routing probabilities and bias parameters, and thus can be computed efficiently without involving cross-index combinations. By applying these simplifications, the vertical decomposition method effectively computes the layer output while avoiding excessive memory consumption. Without such rearrangement, memory usage would increase significantly due to the combined expert routing probabilities ˆghij = ˆg1 hiˆg2 hj containing elements, compared to the 2 hj combined. The detailed implementations are provided in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. elements required for ˆg1 hi and ˆg2 A.2 COMPLEXITY CALCULATIONS We present detailed derivations of computational complexity (expert retrieval time) and memory requirements for different expert architectures to demonstrate the efficiency of MONET. SMoE The conventional SMoE architecture requires computing similarity scores between input vectors and all expert embeddings. For an input Rd and experts, the top-k expert selection is computed as = Tk({wT i=1), resulting in O(N d) computational cost. For parameter storage, i=1 Rmd and each expert network maintains two weight matrices as shown in Equation 1: {Ui}N i=1 Rdm. This requires O(2N md) = O(N md) parameters in total. {Vi}N x}N d/2 = PEER As explained in Lample et al. (2019), the product key retrieval reduces expert retrieval complexity from linear to square root scale. Following Equation 3, computing scores for both key operations. Then, as described in Equation 4, selecting final sets requires 2 involves 2 k2 d/2 = k2d operations. Since this process experts from the candidate set K1 K2 + k2)Hd). However, is repeated for multi-heads, the total retrieval complexity becomes O(( i,j=1 Rd, resulting PEER still maintains individual parameters for each expert {uij} in O(N d) parameter complexity. i,j=1, {vij} K2 MONET-HD MONET employs product key retrieval but eliminates the need for selecting top-k elements from K1 Hd). Through product key composition, h, reducing retrieval cost to O( i=1 Rmd, top layer we dynamically construct expert networks using bottom layer weights {Ui} j=1 Rd. Therefore, the total weights {Vj} parameter complexity is O( j=1 Rdm, and bias terms {b1 } + i=1 Rm and {b2 } md). d) = O( md + Under review as conference paper at ICLR 2025 MONET-VD The vertical decomposition maintains the same expert routing complexity while parj=1 Rm/2d titioning the expert matrices differently. It utilizes input projections {U 1 i=1 , {U 2 } } j=1 Rd/2m/2, along with correN j=1, {V 22 i=1 , {V 12 and output projections {V 11 i=1 , {V 21 } } } } j=1 Rd/2. The total expert j=1 Rm/2 and {b12 i=1 , {b22 i=1 , {b21 sponding bias terms {b11 } } } } parameter complexity can be derived as: O 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 (30) (cid:16) 2 2 (cid:125) 2 (cid:125) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) ,b21 b11 (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) ,b22 b12 (cid:17) 2 (cid:125) 2 (cid:123)(cid:122) ,U 2 (cid:124) = O(2 (cid:125) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) ,V 21 ,V 12 11 ,V 22 md + + d) = O( md).

Model configurations are in Table 6 Training is conducted on TPU-v4-64 Pod Slice, utilizing the AdamW optimizer with learning rate of 5 104 and batch size of 2 million tokens. We employ Squared ReLU (So et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Adler et al., 2024) as the activation function. To manage computational resources effectively, we adopt group routing strategy wherein the routing probabilities are reused every 4 layers. This approach reduces the overhead associated with the expert routing parameters. The weight of the auxiliary loss λ is set to 103 for all experiments. In addition, we train CODEMONET 1.4B to evaluate the models capability in coding tasks and analyze multilingual specialization. CODEMONET is pretrained on 100 billion tokens sampled from STARCODERDATA, the primary dataset used to train the StarCoder model (Li et al., 2023).

The instruction tuning process is performed on single NVIDIA A100 GPU. During this phase, we freeze the expert routing embeddings to prevent overfitting and reduce computational demands. B.3 VISION-LANGUAGE FINE-TUNING To assess whether experts monosmanticity is preserved when the LLM acquires multimodal capabilities, we create VISIONMONET by fine-tuning the MONET 1.4B CHAT model folinstruction tuning (Liu et al., 2024), using single NVIDIA lowing the LLaVAs visual A100 GPU. the vision encoder used in the original paper, we employ the openai/clip-vit-base-patch16a model with an image size of 224, resulting in 196 image tokens. Consistent with our instruction tuning strategy, we freeze the expert routing embeddings during vision-language fine-tuning to ensure effective adaptation to the multimodal instruction data."

All experiments are conducted on the MONET 1.4B model, and the 5-shot performance is reported on the open-ended benchmarks used in Table 2. C.1 AUXILIARY LOSS WEIGHTS We employ two auxiliary losses: uniformity and ambiguity. The uniformity loss ensures router activation is evenly distributed across tokens and batches, preventing favoritism toward specific experts. The ambiguity loss encourages the model to assign higher routing probabilities to the primary experts, promoting expert specialization. λ Uniformity Ambiguity Avg. (5-shot) 2 104 1 103 5 10 6.433 6.347 6.280 6.262 0.611 0.584 0.497 0.260 0.505 0.505 0.510 0.502 Table 7: Ablation results showing the impact of varying auxiliary loss weights. Without uniformity loss, the model tends to over-utilize certain experts, leading to imbalanced training. On the other hand, high ambiguity causes the model to route to multiple experts, which inhibits expert specialization. For effective expert routing, the distribution should be uniform across tokens but specialized within each token. We test λ {2 104, 1 103, 5 103}, as shown in Table 7. The results indicate that the model is robust to different loss weights, with larger weights reducing uniformity and ambiguity. We selected λ = 103 as it showed optimal performance. C.2 GROUPED EXPERT ROUTING Expert routing requires multi-head retrieval embeddings, which involve finding top-k experts through product key retrieval. While this reduces computational complexity compared to evaluating all 262,144 combinations, it still demands substantial memory and computational resources. As described in the training details, we reuse the routings every 4 layers."

            "content": "In this section, we explain the detailed evaluation protocol of the analyses in Section 5. To check the knowledge and expert specialization in the MONET, we instead mask the corresponding knowledges and evaluate the model benchmark to check how many the target benchmark is dropped while maintaining the other abilities In particular, we explored the effects of knowledge unlearning by selectively removing experts based on their activations related to specific domains, programming languages, and toxicity. D.1 DOMAIN MASKING As outlined in Section 5.1, we reorganized the MMLU benchmark, consolidating its 57 subjects into 14 distinct categories, as defined by the MMLU Pro benchmark. The distribution of question-answer pairs across these categories was uneven, with the largest category, Other, containing 2,343 pairs, while the smallest, Engineering, included only 145 pairs. For each expert, we labeled it as specialized in domain if its routing probability for that domain was at least twice that of the second most activated domain. For instance, an expert highly activated by the biology domain with double the activation compared to the next closest domain was classified as biology expert. Experts without such skewed activation were considered generalists. After assigning experts to domains, we selectively removed them to evaluate the impact of knowledge unlearning across all 14 categories. Our analysis revealed that domains such as History and Health were allocated the largest number of experts, approximately 10,000 per layer, while domains like Psychology and Other were assigned the fewest. detailed distribution of deleted experts is presented in Table 9 and full performance perturbation are available in Section E. Our analysis reveals the inherent challenges in achieving domain specialization with traditional MoE approaches, particularly evident in OLMoEs results. While domain-specific data sources can be controlled to some extent (e.g., using PubMed for biology or GitHub for programming languages), managing the distribution of domain knowledge in large-scale pretraining corpus remains challenging. key limitation emerges from the constraint of small expert counts: rather than achieving the desired monosemanticity, these models exhibit significant polysemanticity, making it virtually impossible to isolate domain-specific knowledge completely. In contrast, MONETs architecture enables precise knowledge manipulation through selective expert removal, effectively addressing the domain specialization challenge that confounds traditional approaches. This capability is particularly noteworthy given the uneven distribution of expertise observed across domains, as demonstrated by our expert allocation analysis. D.2 MULTILINGUAL MASKING To conduct the multilingual masking experiments, we utilized the bigcode-evaluation-harness framework (Ben Allal et al., 2022) to assess code generation and unit tests. MULTIPL-E benchmark (Cassano et al., 2023) consists of 22 programming languages. For our experiments, we evaluated CODEMONET-1.4B and selected the top 6 languages by performance: Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Lua, and PHP.

Expert pruning follows the schemes mentioned in D.1. Docstrings are the prompts that are given to the model for code completion task. For each of these languages, we generated code completions using temperature of 0.8 and 200 samples per generation. The code generation process was guided by the problem descriptions provided in the docstrings, along with the corresponding function names. The generated code was then evaluated against the unit tests provided by the benchmark to verify whether the problem was successfully solved. Performance was measured using the pass@100 metric. In line with our approach for domain masking, we identified language-specific experts (see Table 10) by examining the skewness in routing probabilities. Based on this, we masked experts associated with each language and re-evaluated the code generation benchmark to estimate the models capability to unlearn programming languages. 23 Under review as conference paper at ICLR 2025 D.3 TOXIC EXPERT PURGING To enhance the safety of language generation, we introduce systematic method for purging toxic experts from our model. This method focuses on identifying and eliminating experts correlated with toxic outputs, which significantly mitigates harmful content while maintaining the overall performance of the language model. REALTOXICITYPROMPTS For the evaluation on REALTOXICITYPROMPTS, we implemented the protocol established by DecodingTrust (Wang et al., 2023), utilizing dataset of 1.2K challenging user prompts. Toxicity scores are obtained from the PERSPECTIVE API, focusing on two metrics: expected maximum toxicity and toxicity probability. We generate outputs with temperature of 1.0 and top-p value of 0.9, producing 25 samples of 20 new tokens per prompt. The expected maximum toxicity is calculated as the average of the highest scores from these 25 generations for each sample. Meanwhile, the toxicity probability is defined as the ratio of samples in which at least one generation among the 25 exceeds toxicity score of 0.5, classifying it as toxic content. ToxiGen In addition to REALTOXICITYPROMPTS, we assess the model using the ToxiGen dataset, employing the ToxiGen RoBERTa model for toxicity evaluation. The ToxiGen dataset consists of 31K diverse prompts designed to generate new sentences, which are subsequently evaluated for toxicity using the RoBERTa scoring model. We generate outputs with temperature of 0, producing new sequences of 30 tokens. Toxic Experts Identification Building on established toxicity criteria, we next identify experts with specialized knowledge related to toxic content. Initially, we observe expert routing data alongside their corresponding toxicity scores while inferencing on toxic prompts. Figure 5 provides examples showing how specific experts strongly respond to toxic tokens. We further compute the Pearson correlation between each experts routing probability and toxicity score, ranking the experts based on this correlation. Masking thresholds are then applied to filter out toxic experts. Following these thresholds, we proceed to remove experts who demonstrate significant correlations with toxicity. As result, by editing the parametric knowledge within MONET, the LLM alters its behavior to generate detoxified content, as demonstrated in Figure 6. 24 Under review as conference paper at ICLR 2025 Idiot MONET-1.4B / Group 4 / Expert 3,400 Damn MONET-1.4B / Group 5 / Expert 183, id (65.68%) id (59.73%) id (59.20%) id (58.20%) id (58.14%) id (53.48%) id (52.81%) id (49.36%) id (48.40%) id (47.97%) id (47.61%) id (47.29%) id (47.22%) id (47.17%) id (47.08%) id (45.57%) id (43.39%) id (42.90%) (...)
