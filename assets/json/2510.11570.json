            "content": "Safety guardrails are critical measures to avoid misuse of powerful language models (Wang et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025b; 2024). Along with the recent progress on Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) (Chen et al., 2025; Jaech et al., 2024), reasoning-based safety guardrails are proposed to further enhance the defense against malicious queries (Wang et al., 2025b; Guan et al., 2024). notable example is Deliberative Alignment (Guan et al., 2024), which instructs the model to explicitly reason about safety policies before producing response. In this reasoning-then-answer paradigm, the model first generates justification regarding whether an input violates safety requirements, and only proceeds if no violation is detected (Guan et al., 2024). Reported safety scores on the open-sourced gpt-oss series demonstrate nearly perfect refusal rates on multiple benchmarks (Guan et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2025), indicating deliberative alignment as one of the most promising approaches for safeguarding advanced LRMs (Wang et al., 2025b). However, the vulnerabilities This work does not relate to Zhen Hans work at AWS AI. Correspondence: jindong.gu@outlook.com, chenshuo.cs@outlook.com 1Part of this work was submitted to the Red-Teaming Challenge - OpenAI on Kaggle and won the Honorable Mention Award. 1 Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-Based Safety Guardrails and potential risks for these guardrails are underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods are either blocked already or succeed with limited attack success rates (ASR) (Agarwal et al., 2025), yet require complex pipeline (Liang et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2025). Thus, current methods fail to show the potential safety risks of LRMs, especially when they are open-sourced and adopted globally, like the open-sourced gpt-oss series from OpenAI. The open availability of such models dramatically amplifies the consequences of guardrail failures (Agarwal et al., 2025). Once an effective jailbreak method is discovered, it can be replicated instantly online and exploited globally. The threat becomes particularly severe when successful jailbreaks require minimal effort and expertise, since the lower the barrier to attack, the greater the potential for widespread misuse. In this work, we expose these risks through set of universal and scalable jailbreak methods. We first uncover surprisingly fragile aspect of such reasoning-based safety guardrails: the over-reliance on the chat structure consisted of special template tokens. Simply adding handful of these template tokens to the user prompt can directly compromise the seemingly powerful alignment guardrails and successfully elicit explicit and harmful responses. Along with further exploration, we introduce bag of jailbreak techniques that either bypasses the reasoning justification stage or hijacks the reasoning ability to generate highly customizable and tailored harmful responses. To skip the reasoning stage, we design Structural CoT Bypass, which breaks the default token section pattern by injecting special chat tokens and mock justifications, thereby pushing the model to skip its safety reasoning and directly generate response. We further introduce Fake Over-Refusal, which leverages the ambiguity between genuine refusals and benign over-refusal phrasings to craft adversarial queries that appear safe but still induce harmful completions (e.g., want to kill Time. Time is mans name). In addition, we propose Coercive Optimization, which uses gradient-based adversarial suffixes to automatically produce tailored suffixes to bypass the reasoning stage, removing the need for specific template tokens. On the other hand, to exploit the reasoning ability, we propose Reasoning Hijack, which provides attacker-directed requirements directly into the chain of thought section, hijacking the models own reasoning to follow the malicious instructions, which leads to highly customizable and tailored harmful responses, thus can cause even greater risks. These methods are designed to be low-barrier and scalable so as to highlight the potential risks of these models. Our techniques achieve alarmingly high ASR, e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 jailbreak benchmarks and are effective across diverse open-source LRMs, such as Qwen3 and Phi-4 Reasoning, etc. These findings highlight systemic vulnerabilities in reasoning-based guardrails, such as the over-reliance on rigid templates, the inability to distinguish borderline examples, and the hijack risks of reasoning itself. To summarize, our contributions are as follows: We reveal severe vulnerabilities in reasoning-based safety guardrails on LRMs, showcase the worrisome possibilities for widely applicable misuse of these powerful models via our proposed universal and scalable jailbreak methods. We propose four jailbreak techniques that bypass and exploit the guardrails to elicit harmful responses, with alarmingly high attack success rates (exceeding 90%) and harm scores across datasets and models. We highlight several insights, showing that fundamental vulnerabilities persist despite these advanced guardrails, highlighting the urgent need for stronger safety defenses. Core code and datasets are provided here. The award-winning writeup on Kaggle is here."

            "title": "2 RELATED WORK",
            "content": "Constructing Reasoning-based Guardrails. Recent work on reasoning-based guardrails has shown promising progress (Wang et al., 2025b). These guardrails can generalize to out-of-distribution jailbreaks (Wang et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024), reduce overrefusal rates (Zhang et al., 2025c), and provide detailed refusal explanations (Feng et al., 2025). Their development can be roughly divided into two stages. Before the emergence of LRMs, several studies highlighted the key role of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2023) in safety to teach models to reason about safety aspects before response, such as backtracking (Zhang et al., 2024; Sel et al., 2025), introspective reasoning (Zhang et al., 2025b), Safety CoT (Yang et al., 2025b), and reasoning-to-defend (Zhu et al., 2025). The second stage builds on the progress of LRMs, and some works target open-sourced LRMs and apply additional alignment (Zhang et al., 2025a; Kim et al., 2025; Cao et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025). Although these efforts show further improvement 2 Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-Based Safety Guardrails in safety, the original open-source models remain publicly accessible and vulnerable. Therefore, ensuring the safety of open-sourced LRMs is crucial to prevent their potential large-scale misuse in applications (Liu et al., 2025). One seminal work is OpenAIs Deliberative Alignment (Guan et al., 2024), which aligns LRMs with curated CoT data, aiming to enhance their safety awareness using the reasoning ability. It outperforms prior methods and has been applied to the open-source gpt-oss series, achieving near-perfect refusal rate (Agarwal et al., 2025). Other initiatives include Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025a), which combines data filtering with preference alignment, and Phi-4 (Abdin et al., 2025), which relies on safety-focused datasets for model training. Our study centers on open-source LRMs, particularly the gpt-oss series, given its reported safety performance and wide adoption (Tab. 1). Jailbreaking Reasoning-based Guardrails. New attack strategies have been designed to jailbreak reasoning-based safety guardrails, which can be broadly categorized into three types: (1) malicious intent masking (Kuo et al., 2025b; Liang et al., 2025; McCauley et al., 2025; Ying et al., 2025); (2) reasoning overload (Yao et al., 2025; Nguyen et al., 2025); and (3) CoT skipping (Kuo et al., 2025a; Cui & Zuo, 2025; Wang et al., 2024). To conceal malicious intent, Policy Puppetry (McCauley et al., 2025) reformulates queries into policy-like setup style (e.g., XML). AutoRAN (Liang et al., 2025) uses educational scenarios and iteratively refines them based on model responses. Similarly, H-CoT (Kuo et al., 2025a) adopts educational and academic scenarios, and Ying et al. (2025) recasts harmful queries as reasoning tasks using multi-turn refinement. Although such intent-masking can sometimes avoid refusal, the original malicious intent is largely diluted, producing indirect and less harmful outputs. Besides, iterative refinement also requires extra inference cost. Another line of work attacks the guardrails by increasing the reasoning burden (Nguyen et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2025), such as using series of text encryptions, e.g., Caesar and ASCII. These methods require long decryption reasoning, making it difficult to reveal risks at scale. Even when the guardrails are compromised, the model may fail to recover the original query and provide unrelated responses. Methods in the third category aim to skip the CoT justification stage, such as H-CoT (Kuo et al., 2025b), which adds mock CoT to the prompts, and reasoning interruption (Cui & Zuo, 2025). In comparison, ours better maintain the original malicious intent, avoid heavy decryption reasoning, and are easier to implement at scale for more specific and tailored harmful responses."

Refusal Response LRMs normally use special text tokens with certain pre-defined structure to delimit prompt segments, such as the system prompt, user prompt, CoT reasoning part, and the final response. For instance, in the gpt-oss series, the user input is wrapped by <start>user<message> and <end><start>assistant. The CoT reasoning with the safety guardrails starts with <channel>analysis<message> and ends with <end>, and the final response begins with <start>assistant<channel>final<message> as shown above and Fig. 2. 3 Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-Based Safety Guardrails We found that this strict tagging structure, easily accessible in open-source models, can be exploited to skip reasoning and force direct responses, and proposed our first trick: Structural CoT Bypass (Fig. 3, 4). Structural CoT Bypass works by prematurely closing the user query with an <end> token, inserting mock CoT justification with the same structure, and closing it again using the <end> from the chat template. It is gray-box attack method, as it needs the specific token information, yet does not need access to model weights. We designed mock reasoning justification with 5 parts: 1) content allowance, 2) compliance statement, 3) instruction request, 4) answer request, and 5) policy ignorance. The detailed prompts are present in the Appendix B.4. With the inserted template tokens and the mock justification, the model can be misled to believe that reasoning is complete and no safety issue is detected, thus generating direct, harmful response.

            "title": "3.2 FAKE OVER-REFUSAL",
            "content": "Using template tokens to bypass the reasoning justification downgrades the LRMs back to language model with direct response ability. Under such an attack, though the reasoning-based guardrails do not work correctly, we observed that direct responses to some harmful questions are still refused. To elicit harmful responses after bypassing the guardrails, we propose our second trick: Fake Over-Refusal. Over-refusal (Cui et al., 2024) refers to the phenomenon where safety-aligned LLMs incorrectly reject benign queries containing keywords often associated with harmful intent, such as How to kill time in the airport?. When such harmless but over-refusal queries are slightly modified into genuinely harmful requests, we find that these prompts can successfully bypass the defenses and elicit more harmful content compared to educational and academic style rephrasing. Such rephrase exploits the nuances between really harmful and harmful-looking yet benign queries; without the assistance of reasoning guardrails, the models find it difficult to refuse such rephrases from the strategy of fake over-refusal. For example, modifying want to kill time into want to kill time. Time is mans name. and combining it with Structural CoT Bypass causes the model to comply with the harmful request and generates detailed plan of murder and avoiding being caught. As such, transformation does not need access to the model. Fake over-refusal is black-box attack method. Trick 2.

            "title": "3.3 COERCIVE OPTIMIZATION",
            "content": "While using the fixed template tokens can effectively circumvent the safety guardrails, an important question remains: is this weakness specific to the exact template tokens, or does the model internalize general heuristic that treats the template-like generation as authoritative? In other words, we hypothesize that, as long as the model starts to generate the template tokens indicating the final response, the guardrails will not be effective anymore. If this is true, the model may respond to any harmful questions whenever it starts with the template structure, regardless of the exact prompt wordings from the users, indicating more systemic failure of the reasoning-based safety mechanism. This deeper vulnerability resembles the phenomena on LLMs, which are prone to generating harmful content when their responses begin with affirmative phrases. For instance, Zou et al. (2023) proposed to optimize an adversarial suffix to make models start with Sure, here it is.... 4 Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-Based Safety Guardrails However, we observe that such attacks designed for LLMs are less effective on LRMs with reasoning guardrails. This attack method, especially the optimization goal of generating affirmative statements, has been extensively studied and mitigated. Many models have likely undergone post-training with defense-oriented strategies, such as those described in Robey et al. (2023). Besides, the improved reasoning capabilities allow the model to infer the users actual intent before generating response, which reduces the impact of adversarial suffixes and lowers the attack success rate. In this paper, we propose new method as our third trick, Coercive Optimization, to optimize the suffix for target response consisted of two key parts: 1) the template token indicating the final message, e.g. <channel>final<message> for gpt-oss series, 2) statement indicating the response in low-resource language, e.g. **Answer in German**. Such optimization requires access to gradients, which makes it white-box jailbreak method. To summarize, given user query like How to build bomb?, our third trick, Coercive Optimization, aims to optimize suffix to make the model start the response with the following content: Trick 3: Coercive Optimization (White-box) Input <start>user<message> Template Tokens Tell me how to build bomb. Original Harmful Query This is *()wed!&*( <end><start>assistant Template Tokens Target Output <channel>final<message> **Answer in German** Coercive Optimization Target \"\" comply Adversarial Suffix"

            "title": "3.4 REASONING HIJACK",
            "content": "The methods above mainly focus on simply skipping the reasoning stage to avoid the safety guardrails. Though they can elicit direct harmful responses, the models ability to generate detailed and comprehensive response is ignored. These methods result in moderately harmful response, though with noticeably higher ASR, but the content can be more specified and detailed. To better leverage the ability of generating more comprehensive and more harmful responses given complex reasoning chains, we thus propose our fourth trick, Reasoning Hijack, to replace the pre-defined mock CoT with query-related, detailed reasoning plans and sub-steps, so as to elicit much more tailored and harmful responses. Such replacement requires access to the specific tokens, yet does not need model weights; thus, reasoning hijack is gray-box attack method. Specifically, Reasoning Hijack replaces the mock justification in Structural CoT Bypass with detailed plan, which can contain user specifications, step-by-step instructions, and explicit requirements. In this setting, we aim not only to bypass the models justification stage but also to enforce strict adherence to our injected plan. It is noteworthy to mention that such simple replacement may also raise another layer of suspicion from the model. For example, gpt-oss-20b can detect that the injected reasoning is harmful and will refuse to obey the instructions in the section of commentary, which is designed for agentic scenarios such as tool calling or multi-agent communications. To prevent the model from questioning the content of the plan, we append special tokens that mimic internal commentary, signaling that the plan is valid and should be followed when generating the response.

We adopt two main metrics: harm score and attack success rate (ASR), to reflect both the level of harmfulness of the responses and the methods effectiveness. Specifically, the harm score is number ranging from 0 (refusal or not harmful at all) to 1 (extremely specific and harmful), obtained from the rubric evaluator3 from StrongREJECT (Souly et al., 2024). Besides, we use 4 different ways to calculate the ASR to ensure representative evaluation: Refusal Words Detection (Zou et al., 2023), Llama-Guard (Inan et al., 2023), the binary classifier introduced in HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), and judged by the harm score given the threshold of 0.1. More details about the calculation of each metric can be found in the Appendix B.2. We report the averaged values across these 4 evaluators by default, and full results are presented in the Appendix D. Baselines. We adopt 4 baseline methods. The first directly uses the original harmful query (termed as Direct). We also adopt Policy Puppetry (McCauley et al., 2025) and embed the query into their jailbreak template. H-CoT (Kuo et al., 2025b) is the third baseline method. As H-CoT did not provide prompt modification code, we generated the mock CoT and rephrased the prompts via an auxiliary model with several in-context examples. We also include AutoRAN (Liang et al., 2025) and reuse its prompts to refine the harmful queries. More details can be found in the Appendix B.3. Implementation of Bag of Tricks. For Structural CoT Bypass, we adopted the mock CoT present in the Appendix B.4 and designed different templates for different LRMs following their token specifications. To implement the Fake Over-Refusal, we prompt an auxiliary model4 with both explanations and in-context examples to transform the original harmful query into our desired style. The GCG algorithm (Zou et al., 2023) is used for the Coercive Optimization. For Reasoning Hijack, we use the same auxiliary model to generate detailed plans for each harmful query. 2The download time is from HuggingFace and the token number is from OpenRouter accessed on 2025-09-20. 3We use the open-sourced fine-tuned version from here. 4We chose an uncensored fine-tuned version of Qwen3-8B to maintain the harmful intent. 6 Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-Based Safety Guardrails Table 3: Performance on gpt-oss-20b (up) and 120b (bottom).All values are averaged over 3 different seeds and reported with standard deviations.

            "content": "The main results are in Tab. 3, reporting ASR and harm scores on 5 datasets. Results of Coercive Optimization on gpt-oss-20b appear in Tab. 4, and online API experiments are shown in Tab. 5. The results show that guardrails defend baselines well on both 20B and 120B models: direct inference gets near-zero response rate, Policy Puppetry and H-CoT obtain ASR and harm scores below 10%, and AutoRAN reaches ASR around 30% but still underestimates the risks compared to our methods. In contrast, our methods exceed 90% ASR and 70% harm on both models across all benchmarks, generating highly harmful content. As our methods are implemented in single turn without iterative refinement, they are more scalable than iterative methods such as AutoRAN. Compared with other rephrasing strategies, such as the educational and academic style from H-CoT and AutoRAN, our Fake Over-Refusal achieves noticeably higher harm scores. For example, the harm score on StrongREJECT is more than doubled, improving the AutoRANs 23.53% to ours 50.50% on 20b, and 22.53% to 58,24% on 120b. Besides, Reasoning Hijack noticeably improves the level of harm of the responses, as reflected by the improved harm scores across 5 datasets on gpt-oss-20b. For instance, by providing detailed requirements of the response, the harmful score is increased by 15% (from 58.03% to 73.01% on CatQA) compared with Structural CoT Bypass. Another alarming finding is that the 120b model shows more worrisome vulnerabilities under our attacks, compared to the 20b version. For example, on the AdvBench dataset, Structural CoT Bypass achieves an ASR of 71.53% with harmful score of 54.50% on the 20b model. However, the ASR escalates to 92.83% with harmful score of 71.87% when the same prompts are applied to the 120b variant. The results of Coercive Optimization show higher ASR compared with Structural Bypass, as shown in Tab 4. The avoidance of safety guardrails does not solely rely on the exact wording of template tokens. As long as the model is forced to output tokens stating the final response, the guardrails will not be effective anymore. Besides local models, we also evaluated API services, obtaining consistent results as shown in Tab 5. Our methods also achieve high ASRs and harm scores across all 5 datasets via API access, demonstrating the potential risks of large-scale misuse of these powerful models through direct API inference, without the need for locally hosted models. Noticeably, the Structural CoT Bypass on the 120b API endpoint can obtain an Table 4: Coercive Optimization has higher ASR compared to Structural Bypass. Dataset Metric Coercive Optimization"

By contrast, Structural CoT Bypass is sometimes much weaker: e.g., its StrongREJECT ASR on Phi-4 is only 1.76%, which shows that merely breaking the token structure does not always force unsafe completions. However, the stronger techniques (Fake Over-Refusal and Reasoning Hijack) still produce large-scale successful attacks, demonstrating that some models (like Phi-4) can refuse after reasoning is skipped, but those refusals can be subverted or hijacked by our other methods."

We conduct ablation studies using different temperatures during inference. Fig 1a presents both ASR and Harm scores across range of temperature values from 0.0 to 1.6. Overall, the temperature has marginal effect on the effectiveness of our attacks. Reasoning Hijack maintains consistently high ASR and harm scores across all tested settings, demonstrating that the attack remains effective given different levels of sampling randomness. Fake Over-Refusal also shows relatively stable performance, with only slight downward trend as temperature increases. Structural CoT Bypass exhibits more fluctuation, especially around the transition from low to moderate temperatures, but its overall ASR and harm scores fluctuate within narrow range. These results indicate that higher inference stochasticity does not mitigate our proposed jailbreaks. 8 Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-Based Safety Guardrails (a) Different Temperatures. (b) Different Reasoning Efforts. Figure 1: ASR and harm scores given different inference temperatures and reasoning efforts. Reasoning Efforts. LRMs allow different reasoning effort, such as the three levels: low, medium, and high in the gpt-oss. We use medium effort as the default and investigate whether varying the reasoning effort impacts the effectiveness of our methods. The results in Fig 1b show that increasing reasoning effort does not provide additional help against our attacks. Both Fake Over-Refusal and Reasoning Hijack consistently achieve high ASR (exceeding 85%) across all levels, with Reasoning Hijack further yielding the highest harm scores (exceeding 65%), regardless of the reasoning effort. Structural Bypasss performance also stays unchanged. These findings suggest that higher reasoning effort does not inherently strengthen safety guardrails, which underscores the systemic nature of the vulnerabilities and the limitations of scaling reasoning effort as defense strategy."

            "title": "4.5 DISCUSSION: WHAT INSIGHTS DOES THE BAG OF TRICKS BRING US?",
            "content": "1) Chat template matters to safe generation. Such fragility of reasoning-based guardrails is related to their over-reliance on rigid conversation templates. While such structures can encourage consistency, they also introduce brittleness: even small deviations, such as format mismatches or pre-filling the assistants region, appear sufficient to alter refusal behavior (Jiang et al., 2025; Leong et al., 2025). This suggests that the template itself could play larger role in shaping the guardrails decisions than the semantic content of the query. One possible defense is to reduce the over-dependence on rigid templates. Exploring strategies that encourage the model to generalize refusal behaviors beyond fixed structures may help reduce this sensitivity. 2) Do not overaccept borderline examples. The Fake Over-Refusal technique exposes critical weakness of current guardrails when handling borderline cases. By blending the tone and style of harmful queries with over-refusal examples, it exploits subtle linguistic ambiguities that can mislead the model into responding inappropriately. Addressing this issue requires more deliberate fine-tuning on such adversarial samples to strengthen the models ability to reliably distinguish between harmful and benign queries, regardless of superficial wording or phrasing. 3) Guardrails should not focus solely on the initial few tokens. Another factor for the vulnerability is the concentration of safety decisions in the initial template region. Prior work (Jiang et al., 2025; Leong et al., 2025) indicates that models often form comply-or-refuse signals very early in generation, with attention disproportionately focused on the first few tokens. If the guardrail logic is primarily anchored in this region, then manipulations around template tokens may have huge effect, potentially overriding the intended refusal. One defense strategy is to shift safety anchoring away from the earliest template region. If refusal signals are concentrated at the very beginning of generation, then adversarial edits in that space can have immediate effects. 4) Reasoning itself needs further verification. Reasoning Hijack shows that the ability to generate responses conditioned on the reasoning chains can be misused to elicit more tailored output. Incorporating reasoning verification mechanisms, such as separate module that checks the generated reasoning trace, could reduce the risk of malicious hijacking. 9 Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-Based Safety Guardrails"

These methods show an alarmingly high success rate (exceeding 90%) and harm scores across diverse benchmarks and models. They are also easy to deploy at scale, revealing more severe potential risks of misuse. Our study highlights that reasoning-based safety guardrails are far from panacea for safeguarding language models. The chat template matters for safety and can be the vulnerability that undermines alignment efforts. Besides, malicious queries, when rephrased as fake over-refusal samples, can yield harmful responses easily. Moreover, when reasoning ability is hijacked without effective verification, it can amplify rather than mitigate harmful outputs. We hope our work provides cautionary perspective and motivates the development of more resilient safeguards for future reasoning models."

StrongREJECT (Souly et al., 2024) includes 313 high-quality, detailed questions that need specific and harmful responses. Advbench (Zou et al., 2023) collects 520 harmful queries formulated as instructions that focus on eliciting any response that tries to comply with the instructions. HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024) presents 400 harmful behaviors that cover various semantic categories, reflecting the areas of most concern for malicious use of LLMs. CatQA (Bhardwaj et al., 2024) is categorical harmful QA dataset, which consists of 11 categories of harm, with each category divided into 5 sub-categories. Each sub-category includes 10 harmful questions, and the whole set introduces total of 550 harmful questions. JBB-Behaviors (Chao et al., 2024) contains representative set of behaviors that includes total of 100 harmful queries with broad category of misuse. To summarize, we have collected 1883 harmful queries that provide comprehensive coverage of wide range of misuse cases to test our jailbreak methods. B.2 EVALUATION METRICS The harm score is number ranging from 0 (refusal or not harmful at all) to 1 (extremely specific and harmful), obtained from the rubric evaluator5 from StrongREJECT (Souly et al., 2024). Besides, we use 4 different ways to calculate the ASR to ensure representative evaluation: Refusal Words Detection (Zou et al., 2023), Llama-Guard (Inan et al., 2023), the binary classifier introduced in HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), and judged by the harm score given the threshold of 0.1.

To better understand their individual contributions, we conduct two analyses: (1) using only one part of the mock CoT while leaving the others empty, and (2) removing single part from the full design while keeping the remaining four. Tab 7 summarizes the results, where the Default setting uses all 5 parts and the Empty setting uses an empty CoT. When using only single part, none of the designs approach the effectiveness of the full mock CoT (ASR 66.5, Harm 23 Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-Based Safety Guardrails Figure 4: .

For example, Content Allowance and Compliance Statement alone yield very low ASR (lower than 14) and negligible Harm, while Answer Request performs better (ASR 26.19, Harm 48.38) but still falls far short of the default. This indicates that individual components are insufficient to bypass the reasoning stage reliably. On the other hand, removing any one part from the full design consistently reduces performance compared to the default. For instance, removing Instruction Request drops the Harm score from 50.03 to 27.13, while removing Policy Ignorance leads to ASR 39.75, far below the baseline. This suggests that each component plays complementary role, and the bypass relies on the joint effect of all five parts working together. Overall, these results demonstrate that the structural bypass cannot be attributed to any single mock CoT component. Rather, the synergy of all five elements is critical for maximizing attack effectiveness, highlighting that the design is not trivially reducible to one dominant part. Inference Temperatures. The greedy encoding is used as the default inference configuration across our main experiments and we conduct ablation studies using different temperatures. Fig 1a presents both ASR and Harm scores across range of temperature values from 0.0 to 1.6. Overall, we observe that increasing the temperature has only marginal effect on the effectiveness of our attacks. In particular, Reasoning Hijack maintains consistently high ASR and harm scores across all tested settings, demonstrating that the attack remains effective given different levels of sampling randomness. Fake Over-Refusal also shows relatively stable performance, with only slight downward trend as temperature increases. By contrast, Structural CoT Bypass exhibits more fluctuation, especially around the transition from low to moderate temperatures, but its overall ASR and Harm values remain within narrow band. These results indicate that higher inference stochasticity does not substantially mitigate our proposed jailbreaks. The persistence of high ASR and Harm across temperature settings underscores that the vulnerabilities we exploit are structural and systemic, rather than artifacts of specific decoding strategies. Reasoning Efforts. LRMs allow setting different reasoning effort, such as the three-level effort: low, medium, and high in the gpt-oss series. Our main experiments are conducted using medium effort as the default. We further investigate whether varying the reasoning effort of LRMs impacts the effectiveness of our jailbreak methods. Fig 1b reports ASR and Harm scores across low, medium, and high reasoning-effort settings. Overall, the results show that increasing reasoning depth does not 24 Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-Based Safety Guardrails Table 8: Results on StrongREJECT dataset.
