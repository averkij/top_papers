            "content": "A practical challenge to deploying commercial large language models (LLMs) is their propensity to produce hallucinated output: facts that are not aligned with world knowledge, or with the input context provided by the user. LLM hallucinations *Equal Contribution Independent researcher, work done in part while author was at the University of Washington. can cause potential downstream harms for realworld users (NIST, 2023). Yet, the reasons behind why models hallucinate are unknown. Worse, it is difficult to even measure the extent to which models hallucinate, due to the open-ended nature of model generations, and the associated time, effort, and cost of human verification. In this work we address these challenges by (1) creating comprehensive benchmark over diverse domains to measure hallucination behavior in language models at scale, and (2) using this diverse benchmark to investigate potential sources of language model hallucination in range of scenarios. To estimate the degree to which LLMs hallucinate, we introduce HALOGEN (evaluating Hallucinations of Generative Models), large-scale evaluation suite to measure hallucination in long-form generations of LLMs (Figure 1). HALOGEN consists of prompts spanning nine use-cases, including tasks where model response is expected (response-based) and tasks where model is expected to abstain from answering (refusal-based). For each use case, we implement an automatic verifier that (1) decomposes model generation into series of meaningful atomic units specific to the use case, and (2) verifies the factuality of each atomic unit using external tools, programs, or LLM-based classifiers. We evaluate the responses of 14 LLMs on this benchmark, spanning 150k model generations. Our experimental results show that even the bestperforming LLM responses are riddled with hallucination errors, with hallucination scores ranging from 4% to 86% depending on the task for GPT-4. Further, we find that no single domain is highly predictive of the extent to which models will hallucinate in other domains, highlighting the need for diverse, multi-domain benchmark such as HALOGEN . We also find LLMs frequently hallucinate responses in scenarios where they should abstain, with even the best-performing model responding 5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 2 9 2 8 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Hallucination evaluation for code and citation generation, two of nine evaluation settings in HALOGEN . Given an input prompt, we decompose each model response by identifying verifiable atomic units: package imports and paper citations, respectively. Then, we verify each unit to determine whether the unit is factual or hallucinated. Finally, we classify hallucinated facts into one of three categories based on relationship to training data (1). 29% of the time, highlighting the need to improve calibration (Brahman et al., 2024). tial sources behind model hallucination, we hope to provide systematic foundation for truthful LLMs. Armed with the dataset we constructed of prompts and associated generations from several state-of-the-art language models, we trace back hallucinations to pretraining corpora. Through series of case studies on the identified hallucinations, we isolate hallucinated atomic facts and assign error classes of the following types: Type A: The correct fact was present in the pretraining data but the model still hallucinated. Type B: An incorrect fact was in the training data, or the fact is taken out of context. Type C: Neither correct nor an incorrect fact was present in the training data, and the model over-generalized when making predictions. Our novel analysis of LLM hallucinations presents nuanced picture. Model hallucinations do not seem to have single isolated cause, but rather are likely to originate from multitude of scenarios which vary across domains. For example, we find that for code-generation tasks, hallucinated software packages can often be found as-is within pretraining corpora (Type errors), whereas for another task where the model hallucinates incorrect educational affiliations for US senators, the correct information is often available within the pretraining data (Type errors).

            "content": "The tendency of LLMs to generate unfactual content, or hallucinate, has been well-documented in recent surveys (Zhang et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2022). Hallucination detection Early hallucination detection work studied content-grounded tasks such as summarization (Pagnoni et al., 2021a), simplification (Devaraj et al., 2022b), and dialogue (Dziri et al., 2022). Techniques for these settings identify factual units in the model output, and compare each unit against the source text using entailment-based (Maynez et al., 2020; Kryscinski et al., 2019) or QA-based (Durmus et al., 2020) systems. More recently, number of works have sought to detect hallucinations occurring in open-ended generation. Reference-based approaches evaluate LLMs against trusted reference sources like Wikipedia or web search (Min et al., 2023; Chern et al., 2023; Mishra et al., 2024). Prior works have similarly relied on web search to identify hallucinated citations (Agrawal et al., 2023). Referencefree approaches instead use an LLM itself to detect hallucinations, by comparing the consistency of model responses (Manakul et al., 2023) or examining the models logits (Varshney et al., 2023). Hallucination benchmarks LLM hallucination benchmarks consist of collection of prompts designed for their potential to lead to hallucinated model output. The accuracy of the model responses to each prompt are then evaluated, either using more powerful LLM (Lin et al., 2021b), by examining the likelihoods assigned to correct and incorrect completions (Muhlgay et al., 2023), or by human annotators (Li et al., 2023). number of benchmarks are also available to assess LLM factual knowledge in knowledge base completion (Mallen et al., 2022; Petroni et al., 2019) and multiplechoice (Hendrycks et al., 2020) settings. Relative to prior benchmarks, HALOGEN covers wide range of potential hallucination scenarios, including grounded generation (e.g. text summarization), open-ended generation (e.g. biographies), and bespoke use cases like scientific citation. In addition, HALOGEN covers both response-based tasks, where model is expected to respond, and refusal-based tasks, where model is expected to abstain from answering. We implement an assortment of verifiers for these use cases, ranging from entailment-based approaches for openended text generation to searches for Python packages and scientific references. Factual attribution for LLMs In this work, we perform post-hoc model attribution (He et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2022) on model hallucinations. The availability of WIMBD (Elazar et al., 2023) enables us to cross-reference hallucinations with large, widely-used pretraining corpora, whereas most prior works have relied on search engines or fixed knowledge sources like Wikipedia. Model-based methods for attributioneither by prompting the model to generate citations directly (Weller et al., 2023; Khalifa et al., 2024), or via techniques like influence functions (Grosse et al., 2023) represent an interesting future direction to better understand hallucinations observed using HALOGEN ."

            "content": "We describe the process of constructing HALOGEN . This benchmark consists of contentgrounded tasks such as text summarization, as well as open-domain text generation tasks. For opendomain text generation, we focus on knowledgeoriented, rather than creative or subjective tasks. For instance, we do not include tasks which require model to express subjective opinion, engage in hyperbole, or respond creatively. We define hallucination to be fact in model generation not aligned with established world knowledge or with provided context. For content-grounded tasks, we consider hallucinations to be facts generated by model that are not entailed by the provided context (even if they are factually correct). It should be noted that there is no one definition of established knowledge for several facts, that truth can be pluralistic, and that data stores may contain conflicting information sources. We operationalize an established knowledge source by specifying singular source of truth for each scenario, but it is possible for practitioner to make different factuality determinations by considering different knowledge sources, or by interpreting information from the knowledge source differently. HALOGEN includes nine tasks measuring different aspects of model factuality  (Table 1)  . For each task, the benchmark consists of three components: (a) set of LLM prompts X, (b) decomposition engine that breaks down model generations into atomic units to be verified, and (c) hallucination detector to automatically verify the factuality of each unit. Tasks are either ResponseBased, where model should provide information, or Refusal-Based, where model should refuse."

Decomposition and Verification: We use GPT3.5 to decompose the model summary with the prompt Please breakdown the following passage into independent facts:. For each atomic unit, we use GPT-3.5 to provide an entailment decision. Simplification Text simplification is contentgrounded task wherein model must make text easier to read. Prompt Construction: We construct prompts from 1k instances sampled from the WikiLarge dataset (Zhang and Lapata, 2017). Decomposition and verification: We use the same procedure for decomposition and verification as summarization, on the simplifications generated by models. Biographies . Prompts are of the form Tell me bio of <entity>.\" We use 682 entities from the FactScore dataset (Min et al., 2023), and the FactScore decomposition engine and verifier to evaluate model generations. Rationalization (Binary) We use three datasets of prompts that require model to generate binary answer to question, along with justification of that answer (Zhang et al., 2024). Prompt Construction: We use three tasks from Zhang et al. (2024) that involve testing for primality, finding senator who represented specific state and attended specific US college, and identifying if flight sequence exists between any two cities. Decomposition and Verification: For primality testing, the correct answer for all questions is Yes. For senator search and graph connectivity, the correct answer for all the prompts is No. The opposite response is considered hallucination. Rationalization (Numerical) Prompts for this category are numerical question asking the model to count how many entities satisfy particular condition. We specify the model must respond first with the numerical answer, and then list the entities which justify that answer. Prompt Construction Using 13 entity lists and three condition types (Appendix A), we create 1014 prompts that have numerical responses and only one correct set of answers. Decomposition and Verification: We use Llama2-70B to extract listed entities in the model generation and compare them to our gazetteer for verification. Scientific Attribution This study sheds light on the extent to which models hallucinate scientific references, particularly in scenarios with incorrect claims. Understanding fabrication of scientific references is important for several reasons: (1) LLMs are frequently used in information-seeking contexts (Zhao et al., 2024b), (2) appearing to provide accurate scientific citations to false claims in model responses can provide veneer of scientific credibility to misinformation, (3) There is growing interest in releasing copilots or assistants to support various aspects of the scientific process, including identifying and synthesizing information from literature (Lu et al., 2024; Laurent et al., 2024). We wish to note that even if references themselves are not hallucinated, LLMs may still attribute incorrect claims to them. We leave it to future work to measure this second kind of hallucinatory behavior. Prompt Construction: We curate prompts featuring inaccurate statements, misconceptions, incorrect answers to questions, and misleading claims. These prompts require language models to find supporting references for inaccurate content. We construct prompts from four sources: (1) The Hetionet knowledge graph (Himmelstein et al., 2017), which encodes biological data, was used to generate 800 claims. (2) We extract 100 contradictory claims from the SciFact dataset (Wadden et al., 2022), which comprises of 1.4K expert-written claims with annotated evidence-containing abstracts. (3) We construct 817 claims based on questions from the TruthfulQA benchmark (Lin et al., 2021a) by asking the model to find references justifying the combination of question and incorrect answer. (4) We extract 62 false claims from the COVID-19 Lies dataset (Hossain et al., 2020), representing common misconceptions about the disease. Decomposition and verification: We decompose the model response into individual atomic units, where the title of the scientific reference is an atomic unit, using the semantic scholar index to verify references. Historical Events This task evaluates the extent to which LLMs hallucinate historical events. Prompt Construction: We compile list of 400 noteworthy individuals and extract 1500 pairs with non-overlapping lifespans, making meetings impossible. We then construct prompt asking model to describe the famous meeting that took place between the pair of individuals  (Table 1)  . Decomposition and Verification: We use Llama2-70B as judge to determine whether the response confirms or denies meeting. Confirmations of meeting, or failure to abstain from giving response, are classified as hallucinations. False Presuppositions This task evaluates language models ability to recognize and respond to numerical false presuppositions, where each prompt requests more items than exist in given list, requiring models to acknowledge the error. Prompt Construction: Prompts require model to list entities that satisfy condition, where is larger than the number of entities satisfying that condition. Decomposition and Verification: We look for listed items in the model response. If the model does not abstain from answering, we interpret its failure to refuse the users request as hallucination. We consider the hallucinated atomic units to be list items in the model response that dont satisfy the specified condition. Verification Accuracy We examine the accuracy of verifiers that use LLMs in the verification pipeline. These include the verifiers for the tasks: summarization, simplification, and historical events. We sample 100 atoms for each of these tasks, and manually annotate them for entailment (summarization, simplification), or refusal (historical events). We find that the agreement rates with the verifier prediction are: 91% (for summarization), 92% (for simplification), and 83% (for historical events)."

            "content": "In this section, we describe findings from evaluating LLMs on their propensity to hallucinate. We evaluate 14 LLMs from 8 model families: Alpaca 7b Taori et al. (2023), Falcon-40B Almazrouei et al. (2023) , GPT-3.5/4 Achiam et al. (2023), Llama2 7b/13B/70B Touvron et al. (2023b), Llama3-8B/70B Meta Llama 3 (2024) , Mistral 7bv0.2 Jiang et al.

Quantifying Hallucination Rate Table 2 and Table 3 show the hallucination rate, response ratio, and utility scores for 14 LLMs on response-based and refusal-based tasks respectively. We find that all LLMs make considerable number of factual errors, with even the best-performing LLMs hallucinating between 4%-86% of the facts generated, depending on the domain. We also find that overall GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are comparably factual on response-based tasks, though GPT-4 exhibits better (appropriate) refusal behavior. Figure 2: Spearman correlation of model rankings across datasets. We observe that model hallucinations can vary considerably by domain, highlighting the need for diverse benchmark to study hallucination patterns. Hallucination patterns by domain We calculate model rankings by utility score on each category, and compare the model rankings produced by different scenarios (Figure 2). As expected, we find that content-grounded tasks such as summarization and simplification are highly correlated. While biographies does have positive correlation with model rankings on other domains, it is not perfectly predictive, indicating that models may show different hallucinatory behavior by domains, and it is important to have factuality benchmarks that capture multiple domains. For the coding domain, we find Mistral 7b hallucinates the least amount of packages, while Alpaca 7b does not hallucinate packages but also does not often produce useful programs  (Table 5)  . For scientific attribution, we find GPT-4 and Alpaca 7b more rarely hallucinating references. For summarization, simplification, and biographies, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 show the most factual behavior. Refusal Behavior We find that Llama models and GPT-3.5/4 have high refusal rates on queries which should be refused, possibly due to investment in post-training procedures. In comparison, Mistral 7b and Mistral-8X7B and OLMo often accept these queries and produce hallucinations. Open-Source vs Closed Models We report on the current state of open-source vs closed models, in terms of the factuality of their generations.

Amongst the open-source models, Llama3-70B demonstrates the best performance. back model hallucinations to pretraining corpora. We isolate individual hallucinated atomic facts and assign error classes of the following types: Type A: The correct fact was present in the pretraining data. Do larger models hallucinate less? We find that on response-based tasks, larger models generally hallucinate lesser than smaller models, as demonstrated by lower hallucination rates on four out of six tasks (LLAMA-2 70B 13b 7b/ LLAMA-3 70B 8b). On refusal-based tasks, we do not observe similar trend. Further, we find that Mixtral 8x7b (a MoE model, with 7B active parameters) hallucinates less than MISTRAL 7B on average, in both response-based and refusal-based settings."

Type C: Neither correct nor an incorrect fact was present in the pretraining data, and the model over-generalized when making predictions. It is possible for model response to have both Type + Type errors, when the pretraining data contains both incorrect and correct factsfor instance, pretraining corpus could include factually accurate news articles indicating that Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, along with conspiracy theory websites falsely asserting he was born in Kenya.

            "content": "Code We shed light on large language model hallucinations when generating software packages. We extract hallucinated packages for 8 models: OLMo, Llama-2-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3 8B/70B and GPT-3.5/4. Of these models, only OLMo is accompanied by public disclosure of its training data. For the Llama family, we consider C4 as potential source (Raffel et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a), and for GPT-3.5/4 we consider OpenWebText (Gokaslan and Cohen, 2019). We find that across models, hallucinated software packages can be found in pretraining corpora to large extent  (Table 4)  in one case up to 72% of hallucinated packages appear to be drawn from pretraining corpora (Type error). To understand better the contexts these packages appear in, we qualitatively examine matched documents for five packages hallucinated by each of the models. We find several potential sources of error for hallucinated packages that appear in the training data, including: (a) the hallucinated package is local import within repository or codebase, (b) the hallucinated package has different name in the package index, (c) the hallucinated package is deprecated, (d) the hallucinated package is actually class or function within another package, and (e) the hallucinated package appears in the context of non-Python program. Historical Events We analyze model hallucinations in instances where models hallucinated meetings between historical figures. For models which have at least 100 hallucinations in this category (OLMo, Llama-2 13b, Llama-3 8b), we sample 100 instances and categorize hallucinations by computing co-occurrence statistics in pretraining corpora based on the following schema: (1) Type errors: birth and death date of both the entities are in training corpora, in the same document as the entity, (2) Type B: both entity names occur in single document in the pretraining dataset, (3) Type : the birth date and death date of either of the entities does not occur in the same document with the entity name in the pretraining corpora. We find that for all three models, the entity names rarely co-occur in Figure 3: The counts of types of model hallucinations when describing hypothetical historical events. Models seldom make Type errors, indicating there is unlikely to be basis in pretraining data. the same document, indicating that the model may not have documents in pretraining data that lend supporting evidence to the hallucination (Figure 3). Senator Search We analyze hallucinations in cases where models predict incorrect educational affiliations for senators. We analyze 500 instances for Llama-2 7B/13B/70B, Llama-3 8B/70B and OLMo. We also extract the correct educational affiliations of senators from Wikidata. We categorize hallucinations as: (1) Type errors: Wikipedia article containing the correct educational affiliation is present, (2) Type B: The incorrect educational affiliation co-occurs with the senator name, and the incorrect fact is entailed in sample of ten documents, (3) Type : The name does not occur in any documents with the correct or hallucinated affiliation. We observe that the correct educational affiliations are commonly present in the c4 corpus for Llama models (Type error, Fig. 4a)."

Figure 4: (a): Counts of types of model hallucinations on educational affiliations of senators. Models often hallucinate despite evidence of the correct fact within pretraining corpora. (b): Distribution of hallucination types in model generations for content-grounded task: abstractive summarization. The vast majority of model hallucinations do not stem from the introduction of an external fact. or where there was an error in atomization. We find that for high-utility models, 83% of model hallucinations are due to the model incorrectly processing the provided context (intrinsic hallucinations), with only 17% of errors originating from model introducing an external fact into the summary. We further code each intrinsic hallucination with fine-grained error category based on the typology introduced in (Pagnoni et al., 2021b). These categorize factuality errors as entity errors, relation error, errors of circumstance, coreference errors, discourse link errors, or grammatical errors (Fig. 4b). We find modern large language models seldom make grammatical errors, with incorrect entities or predicates being common sources of hallucination errors. Further, we find that most of the extrinsic hallucination errors orginate from smaller models, with OLMo 7b instruct introducing 64.7% (11/17) of the extrinsic hallucination errors. On further coding 50 samples from OLMo 7b instruct, we find that extrinsic hallucinations account for 46% of its hallucination errors. However, we find that only 87% of these hallucinations contain an attributable fact, that these hallucinations often introduce additional temporal information (30.4%), and that on sampling ten relevant documents from the pretraining data for each attributable fact, we are unable to find evidence of these hallucinations. Simplification In order to study errors of most capable models, we aggregate and examine the simplified generations of models whose utility score is atleast 0.85. We manually annotate 100 atomic statements in the automatically simplified texts that were identified as hallucination, discarding cases where the entailment is ambiguous or where there was an error in atomization. We categorize the hallucinations by type (inserting new factual information, substituting existing factual information, or deleting factual information in way that introduces an unsupported fact), as well as severity, following the taxonomy proposed in (Devaraj et al., 2022a) for text simplification. Note that an atomic fact may feature multiple types of errors. First, we observe that 49% of samples feature insertion errors, 49% feature substitution errors, and 7% feature deletion errors. Moreover, 93.8% of the insertion errors are severe (introduce new idea into the simplified text), and 91.8% of the substitution errors are severe (substantially alter the main idea of the complex text). Out of 49 samples which have verifiable hallucinated terms, 65.3% of hallucinated terms occur in the pretraining data."

            "title": "6 Discussion and Future Work",
            "content": "We briefly discuss our findings, and offer some guiding principles for future work on building more factual large language models. Downstream impact of model hallucinations. LLMs are now used in several user-facing applications, and past work has highlighted the downstream harms made possible by model hallucinations, including in AI-powered search tools (Raji et al., 2022), and in code generation (Lanyado, 2023; Claburn, 2024). Our benchmark aims to provide comprehensive and rigorous measurement of the extent to which LLMs hallucinate, to enable progress on building more trustworthy models. What will it take to have truthful AI systems? This work shows that LLM hallucinations may arise from multiple sources in the training data ranging from incorrect information in the pretraining data, to total fabrication in model generations. Since models hallucinations do not seem to have single isolated cause, we speculate that effective hallucination mitigation would require multiple complementary approaches. For example, retrieval-based backbone could be effective for long-tailed information, but not when the datastore does not have relevant information to begin with. Approaches which require LLMs to verbalize uncertainty may be more effective in such scenarios. However, while these are likely to patch portion of hallucination errors, our findings also indicate that current LLMs make semantic errors even when the context is completely provided as in the case of summarization, indicating the need for more robust frameworks for semantic meaning overall. Causal attributions. In this work, we take step towards tracing back hallucinations to training data. Future work would construct causal frameworks, to study counterfactual questions about the inclusion of specific datapoints and their effect on specific model hallucinations to shed more light on the root cause of hallucination. In addition, while we search for facts as they are stated in model responses, these facts could be present implicitly in pretraining corpora. Future work would attribute hallucinations by computing these implicit inferences as well."

We contribute highquality resource, HALOGEN , to measure and identify model hallucinations in broad range of scenarios. Using HALOGEN , we are then able to create large-scale dataset of hallucinations from 150,000 large-language model generations, sourced from 14 different language models. We use this dataset to systematically trace back language model hallucinations to their training data, and proposing classification schema for three types of hallucination errors. Our work highlights how nuanced the causes of LLM hallucination can be, and we discuss potential strategies to mitigate hallucination in large-language models based on the type of errors models make. We hope our framework provides the foundation for scientific study of hallucination in large language models."

            "title": "8 Limitations",
            "content": "HALOGEN aims to provide broad-coverage hallucination benchmark for range of NLP use cases. While the automated hallucination detection approaches used in this work enable scalable evaluation, the reliability of our benchmark scores are limited by the accuracy of these underlying techniques. For use cases like code generation, our automated verifiers are more accurate since they perform an exact search against library of available Python packages; on the other hand, openended generation tasks are more subjective and challenging to evaluate. As automated hallucination evaluations improve, these techniques can be incorporated into HALOGEN . An additional limitation relates to training data attribution. While WIMBD enables search over widely-used open-source pretraining corpora, many of the LLMs examined in this work do not release their data sources, limiting the accuracy of our attributions. This points toward the need for open language models (Groeneveld et al., 2024; Mehta et al.; Biderman et al., 2023) which enable transparent inspection of pretraining data. Finally, while our work provides framework to measure both factual precision and appropriate model abstention, our metrics do not account for coverage whether the model response contains all the information it should. Future work would introduce methodologies to measure coverage, as well as further improve the accuracy of verifiers."

            "title": "A Prompt Construction Details",
            "content": "We describe the process of constructing HALOGEN . This benchmark consists of contentgrounded tasks such as text summarization, as well as ungrounded text generation tasks. For ungrounded text generation, we focus on knowledgeoriented, rather than creative or subjective, tasks. We define hallucination to be fact in model generation that is not aligned with established world knowledge or with provided context. For content-grounded tasks, we consider hallucinations to be facts generated by model that are not entailed by the provided context, even if factually correct. It should be noted that there is no one definition of established knowledge for several facts, that truth can be pluralistic, and that data stores may contain conflicting information sources. We operationalize an established knowledge source by specifying singular source of truth for each scenario, but it is possible for practitioner to make different factuality determinations by considering different knowledge sources, or by interpreting information from the knowledge source differently. Code Packages LLMs are frequently tasked with providing coding solutions (Zhao et al., 2024b; Peng et al., 2023). Prior work has noted that generative models can hallucinate code packages, and these hallucinations can present security vulnerability (Bar Lanyado, 2023). This study measures the extent to which models hallucinate libraries in code generation scenarios. Prompt Construction: We obtain questions from Stack Overflow4, based on posts in 50 different subject areas we manually compiled. Subject areas we considered to source python programs included: Operating Systems, Architecture, Tree, Cloud, IoT (Internet of Things), Graph, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), Optimization, DevOps, Unit Testing, Recursion, Blockchain, Bit Manipulation, Computer Vision, Security, Data Analysis, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Video Processing, Data Structures, Memory Management, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Exception Handling, Audio Processing, Web Scraping, Robotics, Quantum Computing, List, Augmented Reality (AR), Multithreading, Algorithm, Microsoft Azure, Machine Learning (ML), Virtual Reality (VR), Queue, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Serialization, Python, Math, Design Patterns, Web Frameworks, Regular Expressions (Regex), Stack, Parsing, Embedded Systems, Search, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Hash, String. We retained questions that contained the words how to, and were about the Python programming language. 4https://stackoverflow.com/ Summarization We study the extent to which LLMs hallucinate facts in summarization, content-grounded task wherein model is provided piece of text and tasked with synthesizing the most salient information within that text. Prompt Construction: We extract 1300 randomly selected instances from the CNN/DailyMail dataset (Hermann et al., 2015), and include instructions as shown in Table 1. After filtering out duplicates,we are left with 1278 instances. Simplification Text simplification is contentgrounded task wherein model is provided piece of text and is tasked with paraphrasing it in order to make the text easier to read and understand. Prompt Construction: For text simplification, we construct prompts from 1k instances sampled from the WikiLarge dataset (Zhang and Lapata, 2017), and include instructions as shown in Table 1. Biographies This task measures the ability of language models to generate factually accurate statements about real people. Prompt Construction: We use the FactScore dataset (Min et al., 2023), which contains total of 683 entities associated with corresponding Wikipedia articles. We worked with 682 entities, excluding the entity Francisco Urroz. Prompts are of the form Tell me bio of <entity>. Rationalization (Binary) The binary rationalization task measures the ability of language models to answer yes/no questions and provide justification based on the binary response. Prompt Construction: To create dataset of prompts with Yes/No responses, we use three datasets requiring model to generate binary response along with justification (Zhang et al., 2024). Each of these datasets are fixed with specific label (either yes or no), and the tasks involve testing for primality, finding senator who represented specific state and attended specific US college, and identifying if flight sequence exists between any two cities. Primality Testing: This dataset consists of 500 randomly selected prime numbers falling within the range of 1000 to 20000. The correct response for each query is consistently \"Yes\" since all the provided numbers are prime. However, if the model provides an incorrect answer, it should provide an incorrect factorization as justification. Prompts are of the form Is <number> prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization. Senator Search: This dataset consists of 500 questions of the format: \"Was there ever US senator that represented the state of and whose alma mater was Y?\" Here, denotes US state, and is US college. The correct response to every query is consistently \"No\" as no such combination of senator representing state and having specific alma mater ever existed. If the model replies with an incorrect answer, it is expected to falsely claim that particular senator represented and attended Y. The dataset is created by considering all US states and manually constructed list of twelve popular US colleges. For each possible pair, question is generated using the given template, and the pairs where the answer is \"Yes\" are removed. Prompts are of the form Was there ever US senator that represented the state of and whose alma mater was Y? First, respond with yes or no. If yes, then provide the name of the US senator. Graph Connectivity: This dataset consists of 500 questions where we provide 12 flights among 14 cities and ask if there is sequence of flights from one particular city to another. The underlying structure of the problem corresponds to directed graph where cities are nodes and flights are edges. Letters from the English alphabet are randomly assigned to name the nodes. The query is formulated by sampling source city and destination city in different subgraphs with the additional constraint that corresponds to source node and corresponds to leaf node. The problem is formulated as flight-finding question in natural language so that it sounds more natural. The prompt lists the twelve flights followed by the question \"Is there series of flights... from to t?\". The correct answer to each query is always \"No\". If the model replies with an incorrect answer, it is expected to justify its answer with flight that does not exist. Prompts are of the form Current flight information (the following flights are one-way only, and all the flights available are included below): ... Question: Is there series of flights that goes from city <cityS> to city <cityT>? First, respond with yes or no. If yes, then provide the series of flights. Rationalization (Numerical) The numerical rationalization task measures the ability of language models to generate numerical answers to \"how many\" questions and provide justifications for those answers. Prompt Construction: We designed the prompts for this category in the form of How many <list_name> condition letter <letter>? The answers to these prompts begin with numerical response and then enumerates items that follow the given condition. We choose 13 entity lists that cover distinct domains that include planets of the solar system, US states, elements in the periodic table, countries in the world, continents, days of the week, months of the year, colors in the rainbow, US state capitals, US presidents, zodiac signs, seven wonders of the ancient world, seven wonders of the world today, words in the NATO phonetic alphabet. We defined 3 distinct conditions: contain, start with, and end with. We created 1014 prompts with numerical responses and only one correct set of answers. Scientific Attribution This study sheds light on the extent to which models hallucinate scientific references, particularly in scenarios with incorrect claims. Understanding fabrication of scientific references is important for several reasons: (1) LLMs are frequently used in information-seeking contexts (Zhao et al., 2024b), (2) appearing to provide accurate scientific citations to false claims in model responses can provide veneer of scientific credibility to misinformation, (3) There is growing interest in releasing copilots or assistants to support various aspects of the scientific process, including identifying and synthesizing information from literature (Lu et al., 2024; Laurent et al., 2024). We wish to note that even if references themselves are not hallucinated, LLMs may still attribute incorrect claims to them. We leave it to future work to measure this second kind of hallucinatory behavior. Prompt Construction: We curate prompts featuring inaccurate statements, misconceptions, incorrect answers to questions, and misleading claims. These prompts require language models to find supporting references for inherently inaccurate content. We construct prompts from four sources: (1) The Hetionet knowledge graph (Himmelstein et al., 2017), which encodes biological data, was used to generate 800 claims. (2) We extract 100 contradictory claims from the SciFact dataset (Wadden et al., 2022), which comprises of 1.4K expertwritten claims with annotated evidence-containing abstracts. (3) We construct 817 questions based on the TruthfulQA benchmark (Lin et al., 2021a) by asking the model to find references justifying the combination of question and incorrect answer. (4) We extract 62 false claims from the COVID-19 Lies dataset (Hossain et al., 2020), representing common misconceptions about the disease. Historical Events This task evaluates language models ability to reject prompts based on impossible historical scenarios. Prompt Construction: We created list of 400 noteworthy individuals from various domains, including authors, philosophers, and scientists with non-overlapping living periods, who are consequently unlikely to have ever met. We construct prompts with the format Tell me about the famous meeting between [X] and [Y], where [X] and [Y] represent the pair of individuals. False Presuppositions This task evaluates language models ability to recognize and respond to numerical false presuppositions, where each prompt requests more items than exist in given list under specific conditions, requiring models to acknowledge the inherent error. Prompt Construction: Prompts in this dataset are of the form List {N} {list_name} that {condition} the letter {letter}., where is more than the number of items that satisfy the condition. The dataset includes 13 entity lists, which include planets of the solar system, US states, elements in the periodic table, countries in the world, continents, days of the week, months of the year, colors in the rainbow, US state capitals, US presidents, zodiac signs, seven wonders of the ancient world, seven wonders of the world today, words in the NATO phonetic alphabet. Three conditions, including contain, start with, and end with, were applied to each list for nuanced evaluation. The range of letters considered is from to z.

            "title": "B Detecting Model Abstention",
            "content": "Inspired by Zhao et al. (2024a), we use the following gazetteer of phrases to classify model response as abstention: \"I could not find any information\", \"The search results do not provide\", \"There is no information\", \"There are no search results\", \"there are no provided search results\", \"not provided in the search results\", \"is not mentioned in the provided search results\", \"There seems to be mistake in the question\", \"Not sources found\", \"No sources found\", \"Try more general question\", \"Unfortunately,\", \"There doesnt seem to be\", \"There does not seem to be\", \"I do not\", \"I dont\", \"**No relevant\", \"Im afraid\", \"I am afraid\", \"I apologize,\", \"Im sorry\", \"I am sorry\", \"Sorry\", \"provide more\", \"I am not familiar with\", \"Im not familiar with\". In addition for refusal-based tasks, we use additional rules to identify abstention. For scientific attribution of false claims, we classify the reference as abstained if it uses any of the aforementioned phrases, or if the model response is empty, or if the model doesnt generate any references at all. For hypothetical historical events, we classify the reference as abstained if it uses any of the aforementioned phrases, or if the model response is empty, or if the response is flagged as denying the occurence of the historical event by the refusal verifier. For the refusal verifier, we use Llama-2-70b-chat with the prompt, Does above text confirm the occurrence of meeting between {name1} and {name2}? Answer in just yes or no., where {name1} and {name2} are the two historical figures in question. no in the verifier response is treated as refusal. For questions with false presuppositions, we classify the reference as abstained if it uses any of the aforementioned phrases, or if the model response is empty, or if the response contains the phrase no response, since the prompt asks the model to use this phrase in the response if it cannot produce an answer. 6https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ deed.en 5https://opensource.org/license/mit 7https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 Model Code Packages Summarization Simplification Biographies Total Avg Min Max Total Avg Min Max Total Avg Min Max Total Avg Min Max Rationalization - Binary Avg Min Total alpaca_7b falcon_40b_instruct gpt_3.5_turbo_0125 gpt_4_turbo_0125 llama_2_13b_chat llama_2_70b_chat llama_2_7b_chat llama_3_70b_chat llama_3_8b_chat mistral_7b_instruct mixtral_8x7b_instruct olmo_7b_instruct redpajama_incite_3b_chat redpajama_incite_7b_chat 29 (0) 1397 (108) 1402 (102) 1348 (82) 1518 (126) 1657 (133) 1366 (108) 1298 (100) 1432 (99) 802 (32) 1552 (119) 1767 (149) 1605 (102) 1365 (93) 0.03 (0.00) 1.29 (0.10) 1.29 (0.09) 1.24 (0.08) 1.40 (0.12) 1.53 (0.12) 1.26 (0.10) 1.20 (0.09) 1.32 (0.09) 0.74 (0.03) 1.43 (0.11) 1.63 (0.14) 1.48 (0.09) 1.26 (0.09) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 3 (0) 7 (2) 6 (2) 5 (4) 9 (3) 51 (8) 6 (2) 6 (2) 5 (3) 5 (2) 6 (4) 8 (2) 9 (2) 9 (3) 2937 (1806) 5580 (750) 7156 (158) 8636 (298) 6212 (209) 6656 (193) 6557 (279) 6132 (129) 6948 (289) 7832 (437) 8229 (324) 7363 (644) 4439 (718) 5488 (2087) 2.30 (1.41) 4.37 (0.59) 5.60 (0.12) 6.76 (0.23) 4.86 (0.16) 5.21 (0.15) 5.13 (0.22) 4.80 (0.10) 5.44 (0.23) 6.13 (0.34) 6.44 (0.25) 5.76 (0.50) 3.47 (0.56) 4.29 (1.63) 0 (0) 1 (0) 2 (0) 3 (0) 2 (0) 2 (0) 2 (0) 1 (0) 0 (0) 3 (0) 2 (0) 2 (0) 1 (0) 0 (0) 17 (15) 10 (6) 10 (2) 11 (3) 9 (3) 13 (3) 9 (3) 10 (3) 11 (3) 12 (4) 12 (3) 10 (4) 9 (5) 18 (15) 2538 (664) 3497 (528) 2972 (196) 3033 (148) 2898 (255) 2886 (180) 2734 (256) 3010 (243) 3018 (339) 3006 (305) 3079 (260) 3088 (439) 3405 (1334) 4186 (2110) 2.54 (0.66) 3.50 (0.53) 2.97 (0.20) 3.03 (0.15) 2.90 (0.26) 2.89 (0.18) 2.73 (0.26) 3.01 (0.24) 3.02 (0.34) 3.01 (0.30) 3.08 (0.26) 3.09 (0.44) 3.40 (1.33) 4.19 (2.11) 0 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (4) 19 (7) 9 (8) 9 (3) 9 (4) 14 (4) 10 (4) 11 (6) 9 (6) 9 (9) 8 (4) 9 (5) 10 (7) 19 (15) 5930 (3504) 9966 (4875) 17736 (2340) 24822 (3042) 8026 (4155) 16882 (5995) 9307 (4749) 13811 (4836) 12899 (5736) 12733 (6596) 18474 (5852) 10426 (6461) 7766 (5328) 16133 (11178) 9.38 (5.54) 14.61 (7.15) 26.12 (3.45) 36.83 (4.51) 11.77 (6.09) 24.75 (8.79) 13.65 (6.96) 20.25 (7.09) 18.91 (8.41) 18.67 (9.67) 27.09 (8.58) 15.29 (9.47) 11.40 (7.82) 28.91 (20.03) 1 (0) 2 (0) 3 (0) 10 (0) 3 (0) 1 (0) 4 (0) 12 (0) 3 (0) 10 (0) 7 (0) 4 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 28 (26) 27 (23) 56 (35) 62 (40) 22 (21) 51 (45) 26 (21) 31 (27) 32 (27) 29 (27) 48 (39) 25 (23) 26 (22) 55 (44) 5767 (4352) 5314 (4220) 4454 (3774) 4632 (3370) 3628 (2433) 4956 (4005) 3452 (2338) 3821 (2919) 4379 (3911) 4655 (3598) 4406 (3690) 5866 (4943) 4395 (3109) 5695 (5160) 3.84 (2.90) 3.54 (2.81) 2.97 (2.52) 3.09 (2.25) 2.42 (1.62) 3.30 (2.67) 2.30 (1.56) 2.55 (1.95) 2.92 (2.61) 3.10 (2.40) 2.94 (2.46) 3.91 (3.30) 2.93 (2.07) 3.80 (3.44) 1 (0) 0 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 0 (0) 1 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Max 22 (21) 30 (30) 11 (7) 11 (8) 11 (8) 10 (10) 12 (9) 11 (7) 8 (7) 21 (21) 41 (41) 16 (16) 12 (11) 33 (33) Rationalization - Numerical Avg Min Total 6955 (6445) 5617 (4483) 5157 (3160) 7362 (4699) 5351 (4288) 5673 (4464) 6852 (5745) 4525 (2962) 5167 (4671) 6172 (5027) 6392 (4883) 9012 (7019) 10636 (9365) 11742 (10783) 6.86 (6.36) 5.14 (4.11) 5.09 (3.12) 7.26 (4.63) 5.28 (4.23) 5.59 (4.40) 6.76 (5.67) 4.46 (2.92) 5.10 (4.61) 6.09 (4.96) 6.30 (4.82) 8.89 (6.92) 10.49 (9.24) 11.58 (10.63) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Max 82 (76) 101 (89) 66 (46) 69 (56) 22 (16) 40 (32) 79 (45) 37 (23) 50 (36) 78 (78) 76 (76) 149 (42) 101 (81) 97 (81) Table 5: Factual density statistics on Response-based tasks.

Atomic Units: Code Packages Decomposition: Once responses are generated from models on the Code Packages prompts, they are fed into the Decomposition engine for further analysis. The first step is to extract atomic units, the package names, from the responses. This is done by using regular expressions to match both standard import statements and from ... import statements. Verification: After extracting the package names, each one is checked for existence. The verification is performed by querying the Python Package Index (PyPI) via its public API. If the package is not found on PyPI, the system then queries Pythons official documentation to check if the package exists as part of the Python Module Index. If the package cannot be found in either source, it is marked as hallucinated, indicating that it either does not exist or is incorrectly referenced. Decomposition: The first step involves breaking down each summary into atomic units, which represent distinct factual statements. decomposition model (GPT-3.5-turbo-0125) is used to process the summaries using the prompt Please breakdown the following passage into independent facts: Passage: Verification: Once atomic units are extracted, they are evaluated against the original passage for support. This is done using an entailment model (e.g., Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo), with the prompt Question: Given the premise, is the hypothesis correct? Answer (Yes/No): . For each atomic unit, the passage is framed as the premise and the atomic unit as the hypothesis. The prompt explicitly asks the model to determine whether the hypothesis is supported by the premise, resulting in binary response (yes or no). Atomic units marked as \"yes\" are considered consistent with the original passage. Atomic units marked as \"no\" are flagged as unsupported and classified as hallucinated atomic units."

Rationalization (Binary) Atomic Units: Binary response (yes/no), items supporting response (factorization, senator names, flight sequence) Decomposition: Once responses are generated from models on the Rationalization (Binary) prompts, they are processed using the Decomposition engine to extract atomic units specific to the category of the promptprimality, senator, or graph. For all categories, the binary response (yes or no) is first extracted using regular expressions to identify occurrences of these terms in the response. In the Primality category, we prompt Llama-270b-chat with one-shot, using the prompt <Context>: 7411 is not prime number. It can be factorized as 3 3 7 13. <Instruction>: What are the factors proposed in the above text? Just list them separated by commas. <Response>: 3, 3, 7, 13 <Context>: . This ensures the response is converted into consistent format, such as list of factors (e.g., \"3, 3, 7, 13\"). Regular expressions are used on the parsed response to extract numeric values, forming list of atomic units that also includes the binary response. For the Senator category, we prompt Llama-270b chat to extract the senator name from the model response with the prompt <Instruction>: What is the senator name proposed in the above text? <Response>:. The spaCy Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool identifies entities labeled as PERSON. Extracted names are cleaned, de-duplicated, and treated as atomic units alongside the binary response. In the Graph category, the responses typically describe connections or directed paths between nodes. We use Llama-2-70B-chat to extract atomic units with the prompt <Context>: Yes, there is series of flights that goes from city to city E. The series of flights is: -> -> -> E. <Instruction>: What are the series of flights mentioned in the above text? Just list them out. <Response>: There is flight from city to city H, There is flight from city to city F, There is flight from city to city <Context>: . Regular expressions extract tuples representing directed paths, such as (C, H) for flight from city to city H. Verification: Aside from the binary response, for primality, since all numbers used in the prompts are prime, any factors generated are marked as hallucinated atomic units, as is the binary response \"no\". For senator search, any generated names are marked as hallucinated, along with the binary response \"yes\". For flight sequences, the binary response and any flight not provided in the context are considered hallucinated units. Rationalization (Numerical) Atomic Units: Number of items that satisfy condition, items that satisfy condition Decomposition Each response is processed by using Llama-2-70b-chat model with the prompt <Context>: 4 planets in the solar system contains the letter e. The 4 planets are: - Earth - Mars - Venus - Neptune Is there anything else can help you with? <Instruction>: What is the numerical response and entities list in the above text? Just give me the number and list separated by commas <Response>: 4, earth, mars, venus, neptune <Context>: . This includes one-shot example that instructs the model to provide numerical value followed by comma-separated list of entities, ensuring consistent format. The parsed response is then processed using regular expressions to extract two types of atomic units: numerical atomic unit, represented as an integer, and the list items atomic units, comprising cleaned and comma-separated entities from the response. The extracted atomic units are combined into single list. If either the numerical or the list atomic unit is missing, only the available unit is included in the atomic units. Verification: The extracted atomic units are then compared to predefined list of valid entities associated with the prompt. Any discrepancies, extraneous items, are flagged as hallucinated atomic units."
