            "title": "1 Introduction\nThe Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation occupies a distinguished position in the undergraduate and graduate\nphysics curriculum, serving as the canonical example of a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) that\nadmits exact analytical solutions with remarkable physical properties [3]. First derived in the context of shallow\nwater waves [1], this equation demonstrates how the competing effects of nonlinearity and dispersion can achieve\na delicate balance, producing localized wave structures—solitons—that propagate without change of form and\nsurvive mutual collisions intact [2]. The discovery that such behavior arises from complete integrability, with an\ninfinite hierarchy of conservation laws accessible through inverse scattering techniques [4, 5], has made the KdV\nequation a cornerstone for teaching nonlinear dynamics, Hamiltonian systems, and mathematical physics at the\nadvanced undergraduate and graduate levels [6].",
            "content": "Despite the rich analytical structure of soliton theory, students often struggle to develop physical intuition for nonlinear wave phenomena from analytical treatments alone. The interplay between steepening and dispersion, the amplitude-dependent velocity of solitons, and the elastic nature of their collisions are concepts that benefit enormously from direct visualization and numerical experimentation [7]. Computational laboratories, in which students can modify initial conditions, vary physical parameters, and observe the resulting dynamics, offer pedagogical opportunities that complement traditional analytical instruction [8]. Such exercises allow learners to discover the defining characteristics of solitons empiricallyfor instance, that taller waves travel faster, or that collisions produce phase shifts but preserve wave identitiesbefore or alongside formal derivations. The choice of programming environment significantly influences the accessibility and effectiveness of computational physics education. Python has emerged as the dominant language for scientific computing instruction, owing to its readable syntax, extensive ecosystem of numerical libraries, and low barrier to entry for students without prior programming experience [9, 10]. The availability of high-quality implementations of fundamental algorithmsfast Fourier transforms (FFT), adaptive differential equation solvers, and array operationswithin freely distributed libraries such as NumPy and SciPy [11, 12] enables students to focus on physical concepts rather than low-level implementation details. Furthermore, recent developments in just-in-time (JIT) compilation through libraries such as Numba [13] permit Python codes to achieve performance competitive with compiled languages, removing the traditional trade-off between ease of development and computational speed [14]. These 1 characteristics have established Python as the preferred platform for computational physics courses at institutions worldwide [15, 16]. Pseudo-spectral methods represent particularly instructive approach to the numerical solution of PDEs, combining the elegance of Fourier analysis with practical computational efficiency [17, 18]. By representing spatial derivatives as multiplications in wavenumber space, these methods achieve high accuracy for smooth periodic solutions while introducing students to conceptsthe discrete Fourier transform (DFT), aliasing, spectral convergencethat recur throughout computational physics and signal processing [19, 20]. The KdV equation, with its combination of nonlinear and dispersive terms operating on smooth soliton profiles, provides an ideal context for introducing pseudo-spectral techniques at the graduate level. This article presents sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving the KdV equation, designed with both pedagogical clarity and computational efficiency as objectives. The implementation employs Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive eighth-order RungeKutta time integration via the DormandPrince 8(5,3) (DOP853) method [21, 22]. Performance-critical routines are accelerated through Numba JIT compilation with support for multi-core parallelization, enabling research-grade simulations on modest hardware. The library provides command-line interface for immediate use with predefined test cases, Python Application Programming Interface (API) for programmatic access, and outputs simulation data in Network Common Data Format (NetCDF) format following Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions [23] for compatibility with standard analysis tools. Beyond basic simulation capabilities, the solver incorporates diagnostic routines for monitoring conservation laws and generating animated visualizations, enabling students to verify numerical accuracy and explore the mathematical structure of integrable systems. The software is freely available from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and distributed under permissive open-source license."

We derive\nthis equation from first principles beginning with the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations, following the\nestablished asymptotic analysis framework [7, 6].",
            "content": "Consider an inviscid, incompressible fluid occupying domain bounded below by rigid horizontal bottom at = 0 and above by free surface at = h0 + η(x, y, t), where h0 denotes the undisturbed depth and η represents the free surface displacement (Figure 1). The fluid is subject to gravitational acceleration acting in the negative z-direction. Figure 1: Schematic of the shallow water wave domain. The fluid occupies region bounded below by rigid horizontal bottom at = 0 and above by free surface at = h0 + η(x, t), where h0 denotes the undisturbed water depth and η(x, t) represents the free surface displacement. Gravitational acceleration acts in the negative z-direction, and wave propagation occurs along the x-axis with phase speed c. For an inviscid fluid, the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations governing the velocity field = (u, v, w) and pressure read = x t + x + + y y + z = 0, + z = 1 ρ x , 2 (1) (2) t + x + y + = z z , 1 ρ p 1 ρ = g, t + x + y + (3) (4) where ρ is the constant fluid density. These equations are supplemented by boundary conditions at the bottom and free surface [24, 25]. At the rigid bottom = 0, the impermeability condition requires at (5) At the free surface = h0 + η(x, y, t), the kinematic boundary condition states that fluid particles on the surface remain on the surface: = 0. = 0 η and the dynamic boundary condition requires continuity of normal stress, which for an inviscid fluid with negligible surface tension reduces to = h0 + η, η η w = + + (6) at where patm is the constant atmospheric pressure. We now restrict attention to unidirectional wave propagation along the x-axis, setting = 0 and /y = 0. The governing equations (1)(4) reduce to the two-dimensional system = patm at = h0 + η, (7) x x + z = 0, + z = t + x 1 ρ z , (8) (9) z To derive the shallow water equations, we introduce characteristic scales: λ for horizontal length, h0 for vertical gh0 is the linear long-wave speed), c0 for horizontal length, for wave amplitude, λ/c0 for time (where c0 = velocity, and ρgh0 for pressure. The dimensionless variables are defined as x t = g. (10) + + 1 ρ = λ , = h0 , = c0t λ , η = η , = c0 , = wλ c0h0 , = patm ρgh0 . (11) Two fundamental small parameters emerge naturally: the amplitude parameter α = a/h0 1 measuring wave nonlinearity, and the dispersion parameter β = (h0/λ)2 1 quantifying the shallowness of the water [26]. Substituting the scalings (11) into equations (8)(10) and dropping tildes for clarity, we obtain the dimensionless system x + z x + (cid:18) + α = 0, (cid:19) z = x , (cid:18) x + z (cid:19)(cid:21) = z 1. t (cid:20) t β + α (12) (13) (14) The factor β multiplying the left-hand side of equation (14) indicates that vertical accelerations are negligible in the shallow water limit β 0 [27]. In the leading-order shallow water approximation (β = 0), equation (14) reduces to the hydrostatic balance which, upon integration from to the free surface = 1 + αη using the dynamic boundary condition = 0 at = 1 + αη, yields z = 1, (15) Thus, the horizontal pressure gradient becomes = 1 + αη z. x independent of z, implying that the horizontal velocity is also independent of depth at leading order. η = α , (16) (17) Integrating the continuity equation (12) from = 0 to = 1 + αη and applying the boundary conditions (5) and (6), we obtain Combining with the horizontal momentum equation (13) and pressure gradient (17), we arrive at the nonlinear η + [(1 + αη)u] = 0. (18) 3 [(1 + αη)u] = 0, (19) shallow water equations in dimensionless form [24] + η u u These equations are exact within the hydrostatic shallow water approximation but remain coupled and nonlinear. To incorporate weak dispersion and derive the KdV equation, we retain terms of order β in the vertical momentum equation (14). The regime α β O(δ) 1 with δ representing single small parameter defines the Boussinesq scaling, wherein nonlinear and dispersive effects balance to produce solitary wave solutions [26]. Under this scaling, we seek asymptotic solutions in the form of perturbation expansions η + αu = 0. (20) + (21) η(ξ, τ ) = δη1(ξ, τ ) + δ2η2(ξ, τ ) + O(δ3), u(ξ, τ ) = δu1(ξ, τ ) + δ2u2(ξ, τ ) + O(δ3), (22) where δ = β serves as the expansion parameter. Substituting expansions (21) and (22) into the shallow water equations and collecting terms of equal powers in δ, we obtain at leading order O(δ) the linearized wave equations α = u1 ξ η1 ξ These admit right-going wave solutions of the form η1 = (ξ τ ) and u1 = (ξ τ ), where is an arbitrary waveform propagating with dimensionless speed unity (dimensional speed c0 = At the next order O(δ2), nonlinear and dispersive corrections emerge [3]: η1 τ u1 τ gh0). = 0, = 0. (23) (24) + + η2 τ + u2 ξ = ξ (η1u1), u2 τ + η2 ξ = u1 ξ + 1 3 3u1 ξ2τ . (25) (26) The nonlinear term ξ(η1u1) in equation (25) arises from the advection of mass by the wave motion, while the dispersive term 1 ξ τ u1 in equation (26) originates from the vertical acceleration induced by the sloping bottom pressure distribution [27]. 3 2 To eliminate secular growth and derive consistent evolution equation, we introduce the stretched slow variables = δ(ξ τ ) and = δ2τ , representing coordinate system moving with the linear wave speed and slow time scale appropriate for observing cumulative nonlinear and dispersive effects [6]. We seek solutions in the form η1 = (X, ) and apply the multiple scales method. The chain rule yields ξ = δ , τ = δ + δ2 . (27) Combining the solvability conditions at order O(δ3) to suppress resonant secular terms, and transforming back to dimensional variables through the scalings = λX, = λT (cid:112)h0/g, and η = aU , we obtain the canonical KdV equation in dimensional form [7] c0h2 0 6 gh0 denotes the linear shallow water wave speed. This formulation makes explicit the physical where c0 = origins of each term: the second term represents linear wave propagation, the third term captures amplitudedependent steepening (nonlinearity), and the fourth term describes frequency-dependent dispersion. 3η x3 = 0, 3c0 2h η η η + c0 (28) + + η For computational implementation and to emphasize the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion, we transform equation (28) to traveling coordinate frame χ = c0t and define u(χ, t) = η(x, t). Furthermore, we introduce dimensionless parameters ε = 3c0/(2h0) [m1] characterizing the nonlinearity strength and µ = c0h2 0/6 [m3/s] quantifying dispersion. This yields the standard form employed in the numerical solver [17, 20] t + εu x + µ 3u x3 = 0, (29) where we have relabeled χ for notational simplicity. In equation (29), u(x, t) represents the wave amplitude field [m], with spatial coordinate [m] and temporal coordinate [s]. The remarkable property of this equation lies in the exact balance between the quadratic nonlinear term εuxu, which steepens wave profiles and would induce shock formation in isolation, and the third-order dispersive term µ3 xu, which spreads energy and favors shorter wavelengths. When these mechanisms achieve equilibrium, the equation admits solitary wave solutions solitonsthat propagate without change of form [2]. The KdV equation (29) possesses profound mathematical structure as completely integrable Hamiltonian system. It admits an infinite hierarchy of conservation laws, the first three of which correspond to physically 4 meaningful quantities [28, 4]. The mass functional [u] = (cid:90) u(x, t) dx represents the total wave amplitude integrated over space. The momentum functional (cid:90) [u] = u2(x, t) dx (30) (31) corresponds to the square-integrated field, related to wave action in the physical system. The energy functional E[u] = (cid:90) (cid:34) ε u3 3µ 2 (cid:18) x (cid:19)2(cid:35) dx (32) represents the Hamiltonian of the system, with the cubic term ε 2 u3 encoding nonlinear potential energy and the quadratic gradient term 3µ 2 (xu)2 representing dispersive kinetic energy. These invariants (30)(32) satisfy dM/dt = 0, dP/dt = 0, and dE/dt = 0 along solutions of equation (29), providing essential diagnostics for numerical accuracy [6]. The KdV equation (29) admits exact single-soliton solutions in the form [3] u(x, t) = cosh2 (cid:104)(cid:113) εA 12µ (x x0 vt) (cid:105) , (33) where > 0 denotes the soliton amplitude [m], x0 represents the initial position [m], and the propagation velocity [m/s] is given by = εA 3 . (34) Equation (34) reveals the fundamental nonlinear dispersion relation: taller solitons travel faster, enabling overtaking collisions. The width parameter = (cid:112)12µ/(εA) [m] characterizes the spatial extent, demonstrating that larger amplitudes produce narrower, faster solitons. The remarkable stability of these solutions under mutual collisionsemerging unchanged except for phase shiftsconstitutes the defining characteristic of soliton behavior and validates the KdV equation as an integrable system [2, 5]."

            "content": "Consider periodic spatial domain [xmin, xmax] with length = xmax xmin. We discretize this domain using uniformly spaced grid points xj = xmin + jx for = 0, 1, . . . , 1, where the spatial resolution is = L/N . Let uj(t) = u(xj, t) denote the semi-discrete solution at grid point xj and time t. The periodicity condition u(xmin, t) = u(xmax, t) is implicitly enforced through the DFT representation. The DFT and its inverse are defined as [29] ˆuk = 1 uj = j=0 1 (cid:88) k=0 1 (cid:88) (cid:18) uj exp (cid:19) 2πikj , = 0, 1, . . . , 1, ˆuk exp (cid:19) (cid:18) 2πikj , = 0, 1, . . . , 1, 1 denotes the imaginary unit. The computational where ˆuk represents the k-th Fourier coefficient and = implementation utilizes the FFT algorithm [30] available in NumPy [11], reducing the operation count from O(N 2) to O(N log ) for both forward and inverse transforms. The wavenumber vector corresponding to the DFT basis functions is given by = 0, 1, . . . , N/2, , 2πn kn = 2π(n ) , = N/2, . . . , 1, where the convention in equation (37) accounts for the standard FFT frequency ordering, with negative frequencies wrapped to the upper half of the index range. This wavenumber array can be efficiently generated using numpy.fft.fftfreq [11]. The spectral derivative operator acts on the Fourier coefficients through multiplication by ikn. For the first-order spatial derivative, we have where FFT[] and IFFT[] denote the DFT (35) and its inverse (36), respectively. The third-order derivative x (xj) = IFFT [ikn FFT[uj]] = IFFT[ikn ˆuk], (38) (35) (36) (37) required for the dispersion term follows analogously: 3u x3 (xj) = IFFT[(ikn)3 ˆuk]. The real part of the inverse transform is extracted to eliminate numerical round-off errors in the imaginary component, which should theoretically vanish for real-valued solutions. This spectral differentiation approach is exact in the continuous limit and introduces errors only through aliasing in the nonlinear term, which can be controlled through sufficient spatial resolution [31]. (39) Applying the spatial discretization described by equations (38) and (39) to the KdV equation (29), we obtain the semi-discrete ordinary differential equation (ODE) system duj dt = Fj(u(t)), = 0, 1, . . . , 1, (40) where u(t) = [u0(t), u1(t), . . . , uN 1(t)]T RN denotes the state vector and the right-hand side operator is defined as (cid:20) x The spatial derivatives in equation (41) are computed spectrally via equations (38) and (39). The nonlinear term εuj(xu)j introduces quadratic coupling in Fourier space, which may lead to aliasing errors. However, for the resolutions employed in the sangkuriang test cases (N = 512 or = 1024), these effects remain negligible relative to the specified tolerances [19]. Fj(u) = εuj (cid:20) 3u x3 (41) µ (cid:21) (cid:21) . The computational efficiency of the sangkuriang solver is significantly enhanced through JIT compilation and parallel processing capabilities provided by Numba [13], dynamic compiler for Python that translates annotated numerical functions to optimized machine code via the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) compiler infrastructure. The pointwise operations in the nonlinear and dispersive terms of equation (41) are implemented in specialized functions decorated with @njit(parallel=True, cache=True), where the parallel=True flag enables automatic parallelization of loops across multiple Central Processing Unit (CPU) cores using Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP)-style threading [13]. Specifically, the elementwise computation of the nonlinear term εuj(xu)j is structured using prange (parallel range) rather than Pythons standard range, allowing Numba to distribute loop iterations across available processor threads. The cache=True option stores compiled machine code to disk, eliminating recompilation overhead in subsequent runs. The number of parallel threads is controlled via numba.set num threads(n), where may be specified by the user or defaults to the total number of available CPU cores detected by the operating system. This parallelization strategy exploits the embarrassingly parallel nature of pointwise arithmetic operations on grid data, though the actual performance gain depends on problem size, memory bandwidth, and hardware architecturetypical speedups range from 5 to 50 compared to interpreted NumPy operations for grid sizes 512 [13]. The JIT compilation overhead is amortized across multiple function calls during time integration, making the optimization particularly effective for the iterative RHS evaluations required by the adaptive time stepper. It should be noted that spectral derivative computations via FFT operations remain implemented in NumPy, as these already employ highly optimized Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) or Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) libraries that are difficult to improve upon with custom JIT compilation. The semi-discrete system (40) is integrated in time using the DOP853 method [21, 32], an eighth-order explicit RungeKutta scheme with embedded fifth and third-order error estimators for adaptive step size control. This method is accessed through scipy.integrate.solve ivp [12] with the method=DOP853 option. The DOP853 scheme requires twelve function evaluations per accepted step and provides local error estimates of the form [22] errlocal = u(8) n+1 u(5) n+1, (42) n+1 and u(5) where u(8) n+1 denote the eighth and fifth-order solution approximations at time tn+1, respectively, and represents an appropriately weighted norm. The step size adaptation follows the standard embedded method strategy [22]. If the error estimate (42) satisfies errlocal rtol un+1 + atol, where rtol denotes the relative tolerance and atol the absolute tolerance, the step is accepted and the next step size is computed as (43) tn+1 = 0.9 tn (cid:18) rtol un+1 + atol errlocal (cid:19)1/ , (44) where the exponent 1/8 corresponds to the order of the method and the safety factor 0.9 provides robustness against step rejections. If condition (43) is violated, the step is rejected and recomputed with reduced step size. The sangkuriang implementation employs default tolerances of rtol = 1010 and atol = 1012 for test cases 13, and tighter tolerances rtol = 1011 and atol = 1013 for the more complex three-soliton case 4. The conservation properties described by equations (30)(32) serve as critical diagnostics for numerical accuracy [33, 8]. For the semi-discrete solution u(t) = [u0(t), u1(t), . . . , uN 1(t)]T , these integrals are approximated 6 using the composite trapezoidal rule [34]: (t) (t) 1 (cid:88) j=0 1 (cid:88) j= uj(t), u2 (t), E(t) (cid:34) 1 (cid:88) j= ε 2 u3 (t) 3µ 2 (cid:18) x (cid:19)2 (cid:35) (t) , (45) (46) (47) where the spatial derivative in equation (47) is computed spectrally via equation (38). The trapezoidal rule achieves second-order accuracy for periodic functions [34], though the spectral accuracy of the solution itself may allow for higher-order quadrature. The computational implementation uses numpy.trapz [11] for numerical integration. The conservation errors are quantified as maximum relative deviations over the simulation time span [0, Tfinal]: errM = max t[0,Tfinal] (t) (0) (0) , errP = max t[0,Tfinal] errE = max t[0,Tfinal] (t) (0) (0) E(t) E(0) E(0) , . (48) (49) (50) These metrics provide quantitative measures of the numerical methods ability to preserve the underlying geometric structure of the KdV equation. Conservation errors below 102 are generally considered acceptable for practical simulations, though the sangkuriang implementation typically achieves errors in the range 106 to 104 depending on the test case complexity [36]. The complete numerical algorithm proceeds as follows. Given initial condition u0(x) = u(x, = 0), we sample at grid points to obtain the initial state vector u(0) = [u0(x0), u0(x1), . . . , u0(xN 1)]T . The wavenumber vector {kn}N 1 n=0 is precomputed according to equation (37) and stored for repeated use in spectral derivative evaluations. The Numba JIT compiler is initialized with the specified number of parallel threads via set num threads(n cores), enabling multi-core parallelization for subsequent RHS evaluations. At each time step, the right-hand side operator (41) is evaluated by: (i) computing the FFT of the current state via equation (35), (ii) multiplying by ikn and (ikn)3 to obtain derivative Fourier coefficients, (iii) applying the IFFT via equation (36) to recover physical space derivatives, and (iv) assembling the nonlinear and dispersive terms using JIT-compiled parallel functions. The DOP853 integrator advances the solution from tn to tn+1 according to the adaptive strategy described by equations (43)(44). At specified output times {tm}M m=0, the solution state is stored and conservation laws (45)(47) are evaluated for diagnostic purposes. This process continues until the final time Tfinal is reached. The sangkuriang numerical implementation leverages established scientific computing libraries: NumPy [11] for array operations and FFT routines, SciPy [12] for adaptive ODE integration, Numba [13] for JIT compilation and parallel processing optimization, Matplotlib [35] for visualization, and netCDF4 [23] for scientific data output following CF-1.8 conventions. This combination of spectral methods, high-order adaptive time integration, and parallel computing optimizations may provide both computational efficiency and numerical accuracy appropriate for research-grade simulations of soliton dynamics."

            "content": "The first test case examines the propagation of single soliton in isolation, serving as baseline reference for subsequent multi-soliton scenarios. The initial condition is specified using the exact single-soliton solution profile (33) in the form u(x, 0) = cosh2 (cid:2) xx0 (cid:3) , (51) with amplitude = 4.0 m, width parameter = 2.0 m, and initial position x0 = 10.0 m. The computational domain spans [30, 30] discretized with = 512 grid points, providing spatial resolution 0.117 m. The physical parameters are set to µ = 0.1 m3/s and ε = 0.2 m1, yielding theoretical propagation velocity = εA/3 0.267 m/s according to equation (34). The simulation extends to final time Tfinal = 50.0 s, 7 during which the soliton should traverse approximately 13.3 while maintaining its shape. This test case validates the sangkuriang solvers ability to preserve soliton structure over extended propagation distances and provides baseline for assessing conservation law preservation. The expected relative conservation errors for mass, momentum, and energy should remain below 106 for this smooth, non-interacting solution [33]. The second test case investigates the interaction between two solitons of equal amplitude, which may exhibit phase shift phenomena without energy exchange. The initial condition comprises linear superposition of two sech2 profiles: u(x, 0) = A1 cosh2 (cid:104) xx (cid:105) + A2 cosh2 (cid:104) xx2 (cid:105) , (52) w2 w1 with identical amplitudes A1 = A2 = 3.0 m, widths w1 = w2 = 2.0 m, and symmetrically positioned at x1 = 15.0 and x2 = 15.0 m. The domain is extended to [40, 40] with = 512 points (x 0.156 m), and the simulation time increased to Tfinal = 60.0 s. Since both solitons possess equal amplitudes, they propagate with identical velocities = 0.2 m/s and thus maintain constant separation. However, the initial linear superposition (52) is not an exact solution of the nonlinear KdV equation, necessitating an adjustment phase during which the wave profiles redistribute energy into soliton modes and dispersive radiation [6]. This test case assesses the sangkuriang solvers handling of multi-soliton configurations and the emergence of approximate two-soliton solutions from non-exact initial data. The symmetric configuration also serves as diagnostic for numerical artifacts, as any asymmetry in the computed solution would indicate spatial discretization errors or inadequate time integration accuracy. The third test case examines the overtaking collision between solitons of unequal amplitudes, demonstrating the remarkable elastic scattering property that defines soliton behavior. The initial condition takes the form of equation (52) with asymmetric parameters: A1 = 6.0 m, w1 = 1.5 m, x1 = 18.0 for the leading (taller) soliton, and A2 = 2.0 m, w2 = 2.5 m, x2 = 5.0 for the trailing (shorter) soliton. According to the velocity relation (34), the taller soliton propagates at v1 = 0.4 m/s while the shorter moves at v2 0.133 m/s, ensuring that the faster wave overtakes the slower one during the simulation. The domain spans [40, 40] with = 512 points, and the final time is extended to Tfinal = 70.0 to observe the complete collision sequence and subsequent separation. This scenario probes the nonlinear interaction dynamics most severely, as the collision involves significant amplitude modulation and temporary waveform distortion [2]. The remarkable theoretical predictionthat both solitons emerge from the collision with their original amplitudes and velocities intact, differing only by phase shiftsprovides stringent test of the numerical methods ability to capture the integrable structure of the KdV equation [5]. Conservation errors may increase during the collision phase due to enhanced nonlinearity, but should remain below 104 for the employed tolerances. The fourth test case extends the complexity to three-soliton system, creating choreography of multiple interactions that tests the sangkuriang solvers robustness under more challenging conditions. The initial condition generalizes equation (52) to three components: u(x, 0) = 3 (cid:88) j=1 Aj cosh2 (cid:104) xxj wj (cid:105) , (53) with amplitudes A1 = 7.0 m, A2 = 4.0 m, A3 = 2.5 m, widths w1 = 1.2 m, w2 = 1.8 m, w3 = 2.2 m, and initial positions x1 = 25.0 m, x2 = 10.0 m, x3 = 5.0 m, respectively. The corresponding velocities are v1 0.467 m/s, v2 0.267 m/s, and v3 0.167 m/s, ordered such that each faster soliton will sequentially overtake the slower ones ahead. To accommodate the increased spatial extent of the three-wave system and provide adequate resolution for the narrowest soliton, the domain is enlarged to [50, 50] with enhanced resolution = 1024 (x 0.098 m). The simulation extends to Tfinal = 80.0 with tightened tolerances rtol = 1011 and atol = 1013 to maintain accuracy through multiple collision events. This test case may exhibit complex interaction patterns including transient amplitude amplifications during collisions, the generation of small-amplitude dispersive radiation, and intricate phase shift accumulations [6, 3]. The successful navigation of these multiple interactions while preserving conservation laws and soliton identities demonstrates the sangkuriang solvers capability for research-grade simulations of multi-soliton dynamics. The physical parameters µ = 0.1 m3/s and ε = 0.2 m1 are held constant across all test cases to facilitate direct comparison of dynamical behaviors. These values are representative of shallow water wave systems and ensure that the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion falls within the regime where soliton solutions are welldefined [26]. The specific choices of soliton amplitudes and positions in each test case are informed by established benchmarks in the soliton literature [2, 20] and are designed to produce qualitatively distinct interaction scenarios within computationally tractable simulation times. While these four cases provide comprehensive validation of the sangkuriang solvers core functionality, the implementation supports arbitrary initial conditions through the SechProfile, TanhProfile, GaussianProfile, and MultiSoliton classes, enabling users to investigate alternative scenarios such as soliton generation from non-sech2 initial data, wave packet decomposition, or soliton interactions with continuous wave backgrounds. The output from each sangkuriang simulation includes the complete spatiotemporal field u(x, t), conservation law time series (t), (t), E(t) as defined in equations (45)(47), relative conservation errors (48)(50), and diagnostic information regarding computational cost (number of function evaluations, wall clock time). Data are stored in netCDF4 format [23] following CF-1.8 metadata conventions, facilitating interoperability with 8 (55) (56) standard scientific data analysis tools. Animated visualizations are generated showing the evolving wave profile in three-dimensional space-time representations, with conservation law diagnostics overlaid to provide immediate visual feedback on solution quality. These outputs enable both qualitative assessment of soliton dynamics and quantitative verification of the numerical implementations fidelity to the underlying physics encoded in the KdV equation (29)."

            "content": "The conservation analysis quantifies the temporal stability of the three KdV invariants defined in equations (45)(47). Let Q(t) denote any of the conserved quantities (t), (t), or E(t) evaluated at discrete output times {tn}Nt1 n=0 , where Nt is the total number of stored time snapshots. The instantaneous relative deviation from the initial state is defined as δQ(tn) = Q(tn) Q(t0) Q(t0) , (54) which measures the fractional departure of from its initial value Q(t0) = Q0. Three statistical measures characterize the behavior of δQ over the simulation interval. The maximum relative error, captures the worst-case deviation and is stored directly in the netCDF output files. The RMS error, errQ = max 0n<Nt δQ(tn), (cid:34) σQ = 1 Nt Nt1 (cid:88) (cid:35)1/2 δ2 Q(tn) , n=0 provides time-averaged measure of conservation fidelity that is less sensitive to isolated outliers. To distinguish systematic drift from bounded oscillations, the linear drift rate γQ is extracted via ordinary least-squares regression. Defining the design matrix RNt2 with elements An1 = tn and An2 = 1, and the observation vector = [δQ(t0), δQ(t1), . . . , δQ(tNt1)]T , the drift rate is obtained as the first component of the least-squares solution [γQ, βQ]T = (AT A)1AT b, (57) where βQ is an intercept term. nonzero γQ [s1] indicates secular accumulation of numerical error, whereas γQ 0 with finite σQ suggests oscillatory but bounded deviations consistent with symplectic or near-symplectic integration. 1 Soliton trajectory extraction proceeds through systematic identification and tracking of local amplitude maxima in the spatiotemporal field u(xj, tn). At each output time tn, the discrete spatial profile {u(n) j=0 {u(xj, tn)}N 1 j=0 is analyzed using the scipy.signal.find peaks routine [12], which identifies indices satisfying u(n) j1, u(n) > u(n) j+1, subject to additional constraints. Two filtering parameters govern peak selection: height threshold uth requiring u(n) > uth, and minimum separation distance dmin (in grid points) enforcing 2 > dmin between distinct peaks. For the test cases examined, uth = 0.5 for multi-soliton configurations and uth = 1.0 for single-soliton runs, with dmin = 10 grid points throughout. Each detected peak yields triplet (tn, xj , u(n) ) recording the time, spatial position, and amplitude. > u(n) }N 1 For configurations containing solitons, individual trajectories must be disambiguated from the aggregate peak data. This is accomplished through amplitude-based sorting at each time instant: letting {(x(n) )}Kn k=1 denote the Kn peaks detected at time tn with positions x(n) , these are reordered such that A(n) )} across all times where at least peaks were detected. This ranking scheme exploits the amplitude-velocity ordering inherent to KdV solitons: since taller solitons propagate faster according to equation (34), amplitude rank provides consistent identifier even through collision events where spatial ordering temporarily inverts. . The k-th soliton track is then defined as the sequence {(tn, x(n) 2 A(n) Kn and amplitudes A(n) 1 A(n) , A(n) The propagation velocity of each tracked soliton is determined by linear regression of position against time. For the k-th soliton trajectory restricted to temporal window [ta, tb] containing Nk data points, the measured velocity vmeas minimizes the sum of squared residuals: vmeas = arg min (cid:88) (cid:104) vtn x(0) x(n) (cid:105)2 . n:tn[ta,tb] (58) The explicit solution via numpy.polyfit [11] yields vmeas as the slope of the fitted line xk(t) = vmeas t + x(0) . 9 , (59) Goodness-of-fit is quantified by the coefficient of determination n(x(n) vmeas (cid:80) n(x(n) is the mean position.

The = ε Ak/3 should match vmeas theoretical prediction vtheo for well-resolved soliton solutions, providing validation of both numerical accuracy and the soliton character of computed waveforms. Spectral analysis employs the DFT (35) to characterize the wavenumber content of each spatial snapshot. For the field {u(n) }N 1 j=0 at time tn, the power spectral density is computed as 1 2, = 0, 1, . . . , 1, = ˆu(n) (n) (61) where ˆu(n) denotes the m-th Fourier coefficient obtained via numpy.fft.fft [11]. The corresponding wavenumbers km follow from equation (37) and are generated using numpy.fft.fftfreq. Normalization of the power spectrum yields discrete probability distribution over wavenumber space: p(n) = (n) (cid:80)N 1 ℓ=0 (n) ℓ , 1 (cid:88) m=0 p(n) = 1, (62) representing the fractional energy content at wavenumber km. This spectral probability distribution forms the basis for three information-theoretic measures that characterize distinct aspects of the wave field structure. The spectral entropy [37] quantifies the breadth of spectral energy distribution through the normalized Shannon entropy of {p(n) }: S(n) = 1 ln N 1 (cid:88) m=0 ln p(n) p(n) , (63) where terms with p(n) < 1015 are excluded from the summation to avoid numerical singularities. The normalization by ln ensures S(n) = 0 corresponding to monochromatic signal (all energy concentrated at single wavenumber) and S(n) = 1 to uniform spectral distribution (white noise). Soliton profiles, characterized by smooth sech2 envelopes with exponentially decaying Fourier spectra, exhibit intermediate entropy values that remain approximately constant during propagation. [0, 1], with S(n) The LopezRuizManciniCalbet (LMC) statistical complexity [38] captures the interplay between disorder and departure from equilibrium through the product where (n) = S(n) is the normalized spectral entropy defined in equation (63), and the disequilibrium (n) LMC = (n) D(n), D(n) = 1 (cid:88) m=0 (cid:18) p(n) (cid:19)2 1 (64) (65) measures the squared Euclidean distance between the observed distribution {p(n) } and the uniform distribution {1/N }. This construction ensures (n) LMC = 0 for both perfectly ordered states (H (n) = 0, all energy at one mode) and maximally disordered states (D(n) = 0, uniform distribution), attaining nonzero values only for intermediate configurations exhibiting nontrivial structure [38]. The LMC complexity thus distinguishes structured nonequilibrium states from both trivial order and featureless randomness. The Fisher information [39, 40, 41] provides complementary characterization of spatial localization by measuring the sharpness of the amplitude distribution. Defining the normalized spatial probability density u(n) ℓ=0 (u(n) ℓ where ϵreg = 1015 is regularization parameter preventing division by zero, the discrete Fisher information is computed as + ϵreg)x ρ(n) = + ϵreg (cid:80)N (66) , (n) = 1 (cid:88) j=0 1 ρ(n) (cid:33)2 (cid:32) ρ (cid:12) (n) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) x. (67) 10 The spatial derivative (xρ)(n) is evaluated using second-order central differences via numpy.gradient [11]: ρ (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (n) j+1 ρ(n) ρ(n) 2x j1 , (68) with one-sided differences at domain boundaries. Higher Fisher information indicates sharper spatial gradients and hence more localized wave structures; for soliton solutions, (n) scales inversely with the characteristic width parameter appearing in equation (33). During soliton collisions, transient increases in (n) reflect the temporary steepening of gradients as wave profiles overlap. Phase space analysis employs recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) [42, 43] to characterize the dynamical structure of simulation trajectories. For integrable Hamiltonian systems possessing multiple conservation laws, trajectories are confined to low-dimensional invariant manifolds in the full phase space; deviations from this structure would indicate either numerical error or departure from integrability. The analysis proceeds by embedding the temporal evolution in three-dimensional conservation space with coordinates (cid:18) (tn) M0 (tn) P0 where normalization by initial values M0, P0, E0 renders the components dimensionless and of comparable magnitude. For perfectly conservative numerical scheme, y(n) = (1, 1, 1)T for all n; deviations from this ideal point trace out trajectory reflecting cumulative numerical errors. E(tn) E0 y(n) = R3, (69) (cid:19)T , , The pairwise Euclidean distance matrix RNtNt with elements Dij = y(i) y(j) = (cid:34) 3 (cid:88) (y(i) α y(j) α ) (cid:35)1/2 (70) is computed efficiently using scipy.spatial.distance.pdist and squareform [12]. recurrence threshold ε is determined adaptively as the q-th percentile of the nonzero elements of D, with = 1015 providing robust results across test cases. The binary recurrence matrix [42] is then constructed as α=1 Rij = Θ(ε Dij) = (cid:40) 1, Dij < ε, 0, Dij ε, (71) where Θ() denotes the Heaviside step function. By construction, Rii = 1 for all (self-recurrence), and Rij = Rji (symmetry). Two scalar metrics extracted from the recurrence matrix characterize the dynamical behavior. The recurrence rate RR = 1 Nt(Nt 1) Rij Nt1 (cid:88) i,j=0 i=j (72) quantifies the density of recurrent pairs, excluding the trivial diagonal = j. Higher RR indicates that the trajectory repeatedly visits similar regions of conservation space, consistent with bounded oscillatory errors rather than secular drift. The determinism DET = (cid:80) ℓ (ℓ) ℓℓmin (cid:80) i=j Rij (73) measures the fraction of recurrence points forming diagonal line structures of length at least ℓmin (typically ℓmin = 2). Here (ℓ) denotes the number of diagonal lines of exactly length ℓ in the recurrence matrix, where diagonal line at offset > 0 consists of consecutive entries Ri,i+k = Ri+1,i+1+k = = 1. Diagonal structures arise when segments of the trajectory evolve in parallel, hallmark of deterministic dynamics on regular (nonchaotic) attractors [43]. For integrable systems such as the KdV equation, DET 1 reflects confinement to invariant tori, whereas chaotic systems exhibit DET 1 due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions disrupting parallel trajectory segments. }K1 Complementary phase space characterization is obtained through analysis of Fourier mode amplitudes. The leading complex Fourier coefficients {ˆu(n) m=0 (typically = 35) extracted from each temporal snapshot define trajectory in 2K-dimensional space (accounting for real and imaginary parts). Projection onto the real components of the first two modes, (Re[ˆu(n) 1 ]), yields two-dimensional phase portrait that visualizes the modal dynamics. For the KdV equation, the zeroth mode ˆu(n) is proportional to the spatial mean (and hence to the mass ), while higher modes capture spatial structure. Bounded, closed orbits in this projection confirm the quasi-periodic character expected of integrable dynamics, whereas space-filling or divergent trajectories would signal chaotic or unstable behavior. 0 = 1 (cid:80) 0 ], Re[ˆu(n) u(n) j"

This hardware configuration represents modest computational platform, permitting assessment of the solvers practical utility for research applications without access to highperformance computing resources. Table 1 summarizes the computational cost for each test case. The single-soliton simulation (Case 1) required 208,202 adaptive time steps to integrate over the 50 interval, completing in approximately 152 of wall-clock time. The adaptive time stepper selected finer temporal resolution for this case due to the smaller spatial domain (L = 60 m) and correspondingly higher wavenumber content relative to Cases 2 and 3. The two equalamplitude soliton simulation (Case 2) completed in 75.7 using 98,612 steps, while the overtaking collision (Case 3) required 115,658 steps and 87.6 s. The three-soliton configuration (Case 4), employing doubled spatial resolution (N = 1024) and tightened tolerances (rtol = 1011, atol = 1013), demanded 551,858 steps and 534 of computation time. These timings suggest that the Numba-accelerated implementation achieves reasonable throughput for exploratory research, though the scaling with grid resolution and tolerance warrants consideration for production simulations. Table 1: Computational performance metrics for the four test cases. All simulations employed 8 parallel threads via Numba JIT compilation.

This reduction likely reflects the increased memory bandwidth demands associated with the larger grid and the superlinear scaling of FFT operations, which nominally follow O(N log ) complexity [30]. Nevertheless, all simulations completed within times amenable to interactive research workflows. The preservation of the three KdV invariantsmass , momentum , and energy as defined in equations (45)(47)provides stringent test of numerical accuracy. Figure 2 displays the temporal evolution of relative conservation errors for all test cases. 12 Figure 2: Conservation law diagnostics. (a) Relative mass deviation (M M0)/M0; (b) relative momentum deviation (P P0)/P0; (c) relative energy deviation (E E0)/E0; (d) maximum relative errors across all cases on logarithmic scale. Solid blue: single soliton (C1); dashed orange: two equal solitons (C2); dash-dotted green: soliton collision (C3); dotted red: three solitons (C4). The single-soliton case exhibited the smallest conservation errors, with maximum relative deviations of 7.64 105 for mass, 2.98 107 for momentum, and 1.73 107 for energy. These values are consistent with the specified integration tolerances and confirm that the pseudo-spectral spatial discretization introduces negligible additional error for smooth, non-interacting solutions. The root-mean-square (RMS) errors were approximately half the maximum values (3.55 105, 1.30 107, and 8.28 108, respectively), indicating that the deviations represent bounded oscillations rather than secular drift. Linear regression of the conservation time series yielded drift rates on the order of 109 s1 for momentum and energy, suggesting that the dominant error contribution arises from the non-symplectic character of the DOP853 integrator rather than from systematic bias [22]. Multi-soliton configurations exhibited moderately larger conservation errors, as anticipated from the increased solution complexity during interaction events. The two equal-amplitude soliton case (Case 2) showed maximum errors of 1.57 104 (mass), 1.90 106 (momentum), and 1.45 106 (energy). The overtaking collision (Case 3) produced the largest mass error at 3.33 104, with momentum and energy errors of 6.49 106 and 2.60 106, respectively. Figure 2(a)(c) reveals that the conservation deviations exhibit transient excursions correlated with collision events, particularly evident in the three-soliton case where multiple interactions occur. Despite the increased complexity of Case 4, the maximum errors (2.56 104, 8.86 106, 6.20 106) remained comparable to or smaller than those of Case 3, likely reflecting the benefits of enhanced spatial resolution and tighter tolerances employed for this configuration. The bar chart in Figure 2(d) presents comparative summary of maximum relative errors across all cases. consistent hierarchy emerges: mass conservation errors exceed momentum errors by approximately two orders of magnitude, which in turn exceed energy errors. This ordering may reflect the different sensitivities of each integral to high-wavenumber components of the solution, with the energy functional (32) involving spatial derivatives 13 that weight the well-resolved low-wavenumber content more heavily. Across all test cases, the conservation errors remain well below the 102 threshold commonly adopted as acceptable for practical simulations of Hamiltonian systems [36], suggesting that the sangkuriang implementation maintains adequate fidelity to the underlying physics. Figure 3 presents three-dimensional visualizations of the wave field u(x, t) for each test case, rendered with consistent axis limits (x [50, 50] m, [0, 80] s, [0, 9] m) to facilitate direct comparison. Figure 3: Three-dimensional spatiotemporal evolution of the wave amplitude u(x, t) for the four test cases. (a) Single soliton propagating rightward; (b) two equal-amplitude solitons; (c) overtaking collision between fast (tall) and slow (short) solitons; (d) three-soliton interaction. Color scale indicates amplitude in meters. View angles: elevation 25, azimuth 55. Panel (a) illustrates the single-soliton case, where the initial sech2 profile propagates from left to right while maintaining its characteristic shape. The wave amplitude increases slightly from the initial value of approximately 4.0 to final peak of 5.2 m, with global maximum of 5.21 observed during the simulation. This amplitude evolution reflects the adjustment of the initial conditionwhich approximates but does not precisely match the exact soliton solution (33)toward true soliton state through radiation of small-amplitude dispersive waves [6]. The peak position advanced by 17.8 over the 50 integration interval, corresponding to an average velocity of 0.357 m/s. The two equal-amplitude soliton configuration, shown in panel (b), exhibits parallel propagation of two = 3.0 solitons initially separated by 30 m. Since the KdV soliton velocity is proportional to amplitude according to equation (34), these waves maintain constant separation throughout the simulation. The surface plot reveals two distinct ridges traversing the space-time domain without intersection, confirming the expected kinematic behavior. Minor amplitude variations (final peak 3.66 versus initial 3.0 m) again indicate adjustment toward exact soliton profiles. Panel (c) displays the overtaking collision scenario, which constitutes the most stringent test of the solvers ability to capture nonlinear interaction dynamics. The taller soliton (A1 = 6.0 m), propagating faster than the shorter wave (A2 = 2.0 m), overtakes and passes through it near 35 and 0 m. The characteristic X-shaped intersection pattern in the space-time surface demonstrates the elastic scattering property of KdV solitons: both waves emerge from the collision with their identities intact, differing only by phase shifts [2]. The global maximum amplitude of 7.55 m, exceeding the linear superposition of the two initial amplitudes, reflects the transient nonlinear amplification during the collision phase. 14 The three-soliton interaction in panel (d) presents the most complex dynamics, with multiple collision events occurring as the fastest soliton (A1 = 7.0 m) successively overtakes the intermediate (A2 = 4.0 m) and slowest (A3 = 2.5 m) waves. The space-time surface exhibits sequence of intersection patterns, with global maximum of 8.26 observed during the highest-amplitude collision. Despite this complexity, the three distinct soliton tracks remain identifiable throughout the simulation, consistent with the complete integrability of the KdV equation [4]. Quantitative validation of the soliton dynamics requires comparison of measured propagation velocities against theoretical predictions. Figure 4 presents trajectory data extracted from the spatiotemporal fields using peak detection and tracking algorithms. Figure 4: Soliton trajectory analysis. (a) Space-time contour plot for single soliton with tracked trajectory (dashed line); (b) collision case showing fast (dark red) and slow (blue) soliton tracks with collision region indicated; (c) measured velocity versus amplitude with theoretical relation = εA/3 (solid line); (d) wave profiles at selected times during collision, vertically offset for clarity. Panel (a) displays the single-soliton trajectory as space-time contour plot with the tracked peak position overlaid. The trajectory exhibits excellent linearity, with coefficient of determination R2 = 0.9998 for the linear fit. The measured amplitude of 5.05 0.29 (mean standard deviation over the simulation) yields theoretical velocity of vtheo = εA/3 = 0.337 m/s according to equation (34). The measured velocity of 0.349 m/s exceeds this prediction by approximately 3.6%, discrepancy that may be attributed to the amplitude evolution during the initial adjustment phase. The collision case trajectories, shown in panel (b), reveal the characteristic behavior of an overtaking interaction. The fast soliton (amplitude 7.170.39 m) propagates at measured velocity of 0.508 m/s with R2 = 0.9995, while the slow soliton (amplitude 2.16 0.10 m) travels at 0.185 m/s with R2 = 0.9950. The slightly reduced R2 value for the slow soliton reflects the greater relative perturbation experienced during the collision. The dashed box in panel (b) highlights the collision region where the trajectories temporarily merge before separating. Panel (c) synthesizes the velocityamplitude relationship across all tracked solitons. The data points cluster along the theoretical line = εA/3, providing quantitative confirmation that the computed solutions satisfy the fundamental KdV dispersion relation. The agreement is particularly notable given that the initial conditions employ approximate sech2 profiles rather than exact soliton solutions, demonstrating the robustness of the soliton 15 state as an attractor in the KdV phase space [3]. Panel (d) presents sequence of wave profiles during the collision event, vertically offset for visualization. The temporal progression illustrates the collision mechanism: the faster soliton approaches from behind, the two waves temporarily merge into single enhanced peak, and subsequently separate with their original amplitudes restored. This elastic scattering behavior, wherein solitons interact nonlinearly yet emerge unchanged, constitutes the defining characteristic that distinguishes solitons from ordinary wave packets [2]. Beyond trajectory analysis, the spectral structure and information content of the wave field provide complementary diagnostics of solution quality. Figure 5 presents four measures characterizing different aspects of the spatial Fourier decomposition and its evolution. Figure 5: Spectral and information-theoretic analysis. (a) Power spectral density (k) at initial time for all cases; (b) normalized spectral entropy Sk(t); (c) LMC statistical complexity C(t) = D; (d) Fisher information (t). Line styles as in Figure 2. Panel (a) displays the initial power spectral density (k) on logarithmic axes. All cases exhibit similar spectral structure: plateau at low wavenumbers (k < 0.1 rad/m) transitioning to exponential decay at higher wavenumbers, consistent with the smooth sech2 spatial profiles [18]. The three-soliton case (dotted red) shows the highest total power, reflecting the larger combined amplitude, while the two equal-amplitude case (dashed orange) exhibits oscillatory modulation arising from the spatial interference pattern of the two separated solitons. The spectral decay extends over approximately 15 orders of magnitude before reaching the numerical noise floor near 1016, confirming that aliasing errors remain negligible for the employed spatial resolutions. The normalized spectral entropy Sk, plotted in panel (b), quantifies the breadth of the spectral energy distribution according to equation (63). Values near unity indicate uniform spectral content (approaching white noise), while values near zero correspond to energy concentration at single wavenumber (monochromatic). The soliton solutions exhibit intermediate values in the range 0.460.59, reflecting their localized but smooth spatial structure. The single-soliton case shows relatively stable entropy (0.528 0.021), while the collision case displays larger fluctuations (0.567 0.024) with transient increases during the interaction event near = 35 s. These variations suggest temporary spectral broadening as the wave profiles distort during collision, followed by return to the pre-collision distribution as the solitons separate. The LMC statistical complexity = D, shown in panel (c), provides measure that distinguishes structured states from both trivial order and featureless randomness [38]. All cases exhibit complexity values in the range 0.0220.034, with the two equal-amplitude configuration showing the highest initial complexity (C0 = 0.034) due to the structured interference pattern. The temporal variations appear anticorrelated with spectral entropy: complexity decreases as entropy increases during collision events, consistent with the interpretation that transient spectral broadening reduces the disequilibrium component while increasing the entropy component H. Panel (d) presents the Fisher information , which measures the sharpness or localization of the spatial amplitude distribution according to equation (67). Higher values indicate more localized, sharper-peaked structures. The three-soliton case exhibits the highest mean Fisher information (0.960 0.148 m2), reflecting the presence of multiple narrow peaks, while the two equal-amplitude case shows the lowest (0.641 0.119 m2) due to the broader, lower-amplitude solitons. Notably, the collision case displays pronounced spikes in Fisher information (reaching 1.8 m2) during the interaction event, reflecting the transient steepening of gradients as the soliton profiles merge. These transient features subsequently relax as the waves separate. Table 2 summarizes the mean values of the information-theoretic measures across all test cases.

RQA provides tools to characterize this structure without requiring explicit identification of action-angle variables. Figure 6 presents phase space diagnostics for the collision case (Case 3) alongside comparison with the single-soliton reference. 17 Figure 6: Phase space analysis for the collision case. (a) Trajectory in Fourier mode space (real parts of modes 0 and 1), colored by time; (b) trajectory in normalized conservation space (M/M0, E/E0); (c) recurrence plot with quantification metrics; (d) comparison of recurrence rate (RR) and determinism (DET) between single-soliton and collision cases. Panel (a) displays the trajectory in two-dimensional projection of Fourier mode space, plotting the real part of the first mode Re(ˆu1) against deviations of the zeroth mode Re(ˆu0) Re(ˆu0). The zeroth mode, proportional to the spatial mean, exhibited negligible variation (ˆu0 = 178.85 0.00 m), consistent with mass conservation. Higher modes showed larger fluctuations correlated with collision dynamics: ˆu1 = 149.9 16.0 and ˆu2 = 97.8 27.2 m. The trajectory traces bounded path in this projection, with the color gradient indicating temporal progression from the start (green circle) to end (red square) of the simulation. Panel (b) presents the trajectory in normalized conservation space, plotting (M/M01) against (E/E01). The ideal conservative dynamics would confine the trajectory to single point at the origin. The computed trajectory remains confined to an extremely small region: M/M0 [0.9997, 1.0003] and E/E0 [1.0000, 1.0000026], with total extent approximately 5.86 104. The single-soliton case (orange trace) occupies an even smaller region, while both trajectories cluster near the ideal point (black cross), confirming the high fidelity of the numerical conservation. The recurrence plot in panel (c) visualizes the binary recurrence matrix Rij defined in equation (71), where black pixels indicate times ti and tj at which the conservation space trajectory revisits the same neighborhood (within threshold ε = 3.52 105). The diagonal line structures indicate deterministic dynamics: when the system visits particular state, it subsequently follows trajectory parallel to previous visits, characteristic of regular (non-chaotic) motion on invariant manifolds [42, 43]. The recurrence rate RR = 0.151 indicates that approximately 15% of state pairs satisfy the recurrence criterion, while the determinism DET = 0.999 confirms that nearly all recurrences form diagonal line structures. Panel (d) compares the RQA metrics between the single-soliton and collision cases. Both exhibit similar recurrence rates (0.159 and 0.151, respectively) and high determinism (0.995 and 0.999). The marginally higher determinism in the collision case may appear counterintuitive but likely reflects the longer simulation time (70 versus 50 s) providing more opportunities for trajectory segments to align. correlation dimension estimate of 0.86 for the collision case, computed from the recurrence matrix scaling [43], suggests that the effective dynamics occupy manifold of dimension less than unityconsistent with the trajectory being confined near fixed point 18 (the ideal conservation state) with small bounded oscillations. The results presented above demonstrate that the sangkuriang solver successfully reproduces the essential features of KdV soliton dynamics while maintaining numerical accuracy appropriate for research applications. Several aspects merit further discussion. The pseudo-spectral spatial discretization combined with eighth-order adaptive time integration achieved conservation errors ranging from O(107) to O(104) across the test cases. These values compare favorably with those reported in the literature for similar methods applied to nonlinear dispersive equations [17, 20]. The observation that momentum and energy are conserved more accurately than mass warrants consideration. The mass functional (30) involves only the solution field itself, making it sensitive to any drift in the solution mean. In contrast, the momentum functional (31) depends on u2, which suppresses the contribution of small-amplitude dispersive radiation relative to the dominant soliton peaks. The energy functional (32), involving spatial derivatives, further weights the smooth soliton cores over high-wavenumber numerical artifacts. This hierarchy suggests that the mass error may serve as conservative upper bound on overall numerical accuracy. The absence of systematic drift in the conservation time series indicates that the DOP853 integrator, while not symplectic, introduces primarily oscillatory rather than secular errors for the integration times considered. For significantly longer simulations, the accumulation of these oscillatory errors could potentially become problematic, and structure-preserving integrators [36, 44] might offer advantages despite their typically higher computational cost per step. The close agreement between measured and theoretical soliton velocities (< 5% discrepancy) confirms that the computed solutions satisfy the fundamental amplitudevelocity relationship (34). The small systematic excess in measured velocities relative to predictions based on mean amplitude may arise from several factors. First, the soliton amplitudes evolve during the initial adjustment phase as the approximate initial conditions relax toward exact soliton profiles, and velocity measurements based on trajectory slopes integrate over this transient. Second, the theoretical velocity assumes an isolated soliton in an infinite domain, whereas the periodic boundary conditions and finite domain introduce corrections that may slightly modify the effective dispersion relation [18]. The high linearity of all tracked trajectories (R2 > 0.99) provides strong evidence that the computed waves behave as true solitons rather than dispersive wave packets that would spread and decelerate over time. This validation is particularly meaningful for the post-collision segments, where any deviation from integrability would manifest as amplitude-dependent velocity changes. The spectral and information-theoretic analyses reveal consistent patterns that reflect the integrable structure of the KdV equation. The bounded variations of spectral entropy, statistical complexity, and Fisher information with transient excursions during collisions that subsequently relaxindicate that the wave field returns to its precollision information content. This behavior contrasts with what would be expected for non-integrable systems, where collision events could transfer energy to radiation modes, leading to secular changes in these measures [6]. The Fisher information proved particularly sensitive to collision dynamics, with pronounced spikes corresponding to the transient steepening of gradients during wave merging. This sensitivity suggests that Fisher information may serve as useful diagnostic for detecting the onset and completion of soliton interactions in more complex scenarios. The RQA provides independent confirmation of the regular, non-chaotic dynamics expected for an integrable Hamiltonian system. The high determinism values (DET > 0.99) indicate that the phase space trajectory exhibits the parallel structure characteristic of motion on invariant tori, rather than the mixing behavior associated with chaotic dynamics [43]. The estimated correlation dimension below unity is consistent with the trajectory being confined near fixed point (the exact conservation state) with small-amplitude oscillations. These results suggest that RQA could serve as model-independent diagnostic for assessing the integrability of computed solutions in situations where analytical results are unavailable. Significant deviations from high determinism might indicate either numerical breakdown of integrability due to insufficient resolution, or genuine non-integrable dynamics in perturbed KdV-type equations. The demonstration that research-grade KdV simulations can be performed in minutes on laptop-class workstation represents practical advantage for exploratory studies. The Numba-accelerated implementation achieved throughputs of approximately 10001400 time steps per second, suggesting that the solver is not severely memorybandwidth limited for the grid sizes considered. The observed scaling from = 512 to = 1024 (throughput reduction from 1300 to 1030 steps/s) is consistent with the O(N log ) FFT complexity combined with increased cache pressure. For applications requiring higher resolution or longer integration times, several optimization strategies could be considered: vectorized evaluation of multiple initial conditions in parallel, GPU acceleration of FFT operations via CuPy [45], or time-parallel algorithms for ensemble simulations. The modular architecture of sangkuriang is designed to facilitate such extensions while maintaining compatibility with the existing analysis framework. Several limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. First, the test cases employed approximate sech2 initial conditions rather than exact -soliton solutions obtainable from inverse scattering theory [5]; comparison with exact solutions would provide more stringent validation. Second, the periodic boundary conditions preclude investigation of soliton interactions with boundaries or non-periodic wave backgrounds. Third, the standard KdV equation considered here represents only the leading-order balance between nonlinearity and dispersion; extensions to higher-order equations (e.g., the modified KdV or Kawahara equations [46]) would broaden the solvers applicability to different physical regimes. 19 Future development of sangkuriang could address these limitations while maintaining the design philosophy of accessibility and reproducibility. The integration of inverse scattering routines would enable exact initial conditions for validation studies. Variable-coefficient extensions would permit modeling of wave propagation over varying topography. Perhaps most significantly, the pseudo-spectral framework could be extended to twodimensional generalizations such as the KadomtsevPetviashvili equation [6], enabling investigation of oblique soliton interactions and transverse instabilities."
