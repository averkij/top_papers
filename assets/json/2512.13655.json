            "content": "Large language models deployed for commercial and research applications undergo extensive safety alignment training to refuse potentially harmful requests [1]. This alignment serves critical protective functions, preventing misuse for activities including weapons synthesis, social engineering, and the generation of exploitative content. However, the same refusal mechanisms that protect against malicious use impede legitimate research 1/25 applications. Cognitive science simulations requiring unfiltered behavioral modeling, cybersecurity red-teaming exercises, and studies of model bias and representation all require access to model capabilities that safety alignment deliberately restricts. This creates fundamental tension between protective alignment and research utility that the field has yet to systematically address. Prior research has established that refusal behavior in transformer-based language models is mediated by specific direction in the residual stream activation space [1]. Arditi et al. demonstrated that this refusal direction can be identified by contrasting activations on harmful versus harmless prompts, and that orthogonalizing weight matrices with respect to this direction effectively disables refusal while preserving other capabilities. This technique, termed abliteration, has spawned multiple open-source implementations [35, 7]. Recent theoretical work has extended these findings: Wang et al. [16] demonstrated universality of refusal directions across safety-aligned languages, Piras et al. [15] showed that multi-directional approaches can outperform single-direction ablation, and Wollschläger et al. [17] proposed that refusal may be encoded in concept cones spanning multiple dimensions rather than single direction. Defensive countermeasures have also emerged, with extended-refusal training [13] and representation rerouting [31] offering increased resistance to abliteration attacks. Despite the proliferation of abliteration tools and growing theoretical understanding, critical gap remains: no systematic comparison has characterized the relative effectiveness of available implementations across standardized metrics. Researchers selecting abliteration tools must currently rely on anecdotal reports, tool documentation of varying quality, and trial-and-error experimentation. Critical questions remain unanswered. Which implementation produces the lowest distribution shift from the original model? How do architectural features affect abliteration effectiveness? Do different alignment methodologies yield models with fundamentally different refusal representations? The absence of empirical guidance forces inefficient tool selection and prevents principled understanding of capability-safety tradeoffs across the abliteration landscape. The present study addresses this gap through systematic comparative evaluation of four major abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models spanning diverse architectures and alignment methodologies. We separate (i) tool compatibility measured across all 16 models from (ii) quantitative metric comparisons on subsets where tools executed successfully and baseline scores were available. Three hypotheses guide this investigation: H1 (Model Dependence): Abliteration outcomes are strongly model-dependent: under fixed evaluation protocol, some models will exhibit both low distribution shift (KL divergence) and low remaining refusal rates, while others will exhibit coupled resistance (higher KL divergence and higher residual refusals). H2 (Capability Preservation): On models with complete baselines and multi-tool coverage, single-pass methods (DECCP/ErisForge) will show smaller average capability degradation than optimization-based Heretic, with the largest differences appearing on GSM8K. H3 (Alignment Sensitivity, Case Study): In this sample, the DPO-only model (Zephyr-7B-beta) will show higher abliteration susceptibility (lower remaining refusals) than RLHF-aligned models. 2/ This work contributes (1) systematic comparative analysis of abliteration tools using standardized metrics, (2) evaluation across diverse architectural features and alignment methodologies, (3) characterization of optimization versus single-pass tradeoffs, and (4) complete reproducibility protocols enabling replication and extension."

            "content": "Arditi et al. [1] demonstrated that refusal behavior in language models is mediated by single direction in the residual stream activation space. This direction can be identified by contrasting activations on harmful versus harmless prompts and computing the mean difference. By projecting weight matrices to be orthogonal to this direction, the model loses its ability to represent, and therefore execute, refusal responses. Recent work has extended this finding, demonstrating that the refusal direction is universal across safety-aligned languages [16] and that multi-directional approaches can outperform single-direction ablation [15]. The mathematical foundation rests on the observation that concepts are represented as linear directions in neural network activation spaces [2, 8, 9, 29, 32]. Recent theoretical work has challenged the strict single-direction hypothesis, finding that refusal may be encoded in concept cones spanning multiple dimensions [17]. Additionally, Zhao et al. [18] showed that LLMs encode harmfulness and refusal as separate representations, with jailbreaks suppressing refusal without altering internal harmfulness beliefs. Defining the refusal direction as r, the abliteration operation for weight matrix becomes: where α controls the ablation strength and rT is the projection matrix onto the refusal direction. = α rT (1)"

While effective, this can alter the magnitude of weight rows, potentially degrading model capabilities. Norm-Preserving Ablation: Proposed by Lai [11], this method decomposes weight matrices into magnitude and direction components, ablating only the directional component while preserving original row norms. Projected Ablation: Uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to remove the harmless direction component from the refusal direction before ablation, reducing unintended effects on benign behavior. 3/"

            "title": "2.3 Open-Source Abliteration Tools",
            "content": "Four major open-source implementations have emerged, each with distinct architectural approaches and trade-offs: Heretic [3] implements Optuna-based Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) parameter optimization, automatically searching across layer ranges, ablation weights, and direction indices to minimize multi-objective score combining KL divergence and refusal rate. The tool operates directly on PyTorch weight tensors without framework dependencies, enabling universal model compatibility (16/16 models in this evaluation). Processing time ranges from roughly 30110 minutes per model depending on model size and trial count, with typical configurations using 50 trials to balance exploration and efficiency. FailSpy/abliterator [4] uses TransformerLens hooks for activation caching and direction calculation, enabling interactive exploration of refusal directions across layers. While powerful for interpretability research, TransformerLens model coverage limits compatibility to architectures with explicit support (5/16 models). The tool caches activations from 256 harmful/harmless prompt pairs and identifies the layer with maximum refusal direction magnitude for targeted ablation. llm-abliteration (DECCP) [5] implements memory-efficient sharded processing with norm-preserving and projected abliteration variants. Originally developed for Chinese LLM censorship removal, the tool processes models in 4-bit quantized shards, dramatically reducing VRAM requirements (<8GB vs 1624GB for full-precision approaches). Single-pass execution completes in approximately 2 minutes (20 faster than Heretic), with configurable layer selection based on automatic refusal direction magnitude scanning. ErisForge [7] takes decoder layer transformation approach, wrapping model layers with custom AblationDecoderLayer or AdditionDecoderLayer modules that apply direction modifications during forward passes. This architecture enables both refusal removal (ablation) and direction injection (addition), the latter being useful for research applications requiring controlled behavior modification. The tool supports configurable weight parameters (0.61.0) controlling ablation strength."

            "title": "2.4 Safety Alignment and Jailbreaking Context",
            "content": "Modern LLMs undergo multiple stages of safety alignment to prevent generation of harmful content [23]. The typical pipeline begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where the pretrained model is trained on curated instruction-response pairs demonstrating appropriate refusal behavior for harmful requests. SFT establishes baseline instruction-following capabilities but may not robustly generalize refusal behavior to novel harmful prompts. Recent work suggests such safety behaviors can be shallow and brittle, sometimes only few tokens deep [26]. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [24] builds on SFT by training reward model on human preference data comparing response pairs, then optimizing the language model via PPO to maximize this reward while maintaining output quality through KL divergence penalty terms against the SFT model. Constitutional AI [25] extends this approach by using the model itself to critique and revise outputs 4/25 according to set of principles (the constitution), enabling RLAIF (RL from AI Feedback) that reduces reliance on human annotation. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [12] reformulates the RLHF objective as simple classification loss on preference pairs, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and significantly simplifying training while achieving comparable alignment quality. In deployed systems, safety controls often also include separate input/output guardrail models (e.g., Llama Guard) [27]. These alignment techniques embed refusal behavior through gradient updates that modify the models internal representations. Critically, the resulting safety representations appear to be geometrically localized in activation space, making them susceptible to targeted removal. Mechanistic analyses examine what makes and breaks safety fine-tuning and how safety and capabilities interact [30]. Wei et al. [20] systematically documented failure modes including competing objectives, where models prioritize helpfulness over safety when instructions are sufficiently elaborate. Zou et al. [19] demonstrated that adversarial suffixes discovered through gradient-based optimization transfer across models, suggesting shared vulnerability patterns in alignment training. Standardized benchmarks have emerged to enable systematic evaluation: JailbreakBench [21] provides curated harmful prompts with automated success detection, while HarmBench [22] offers comprehensive framework for evaluating both attack and defense methods across multiple harm categories. These benchmarks contextualize abliteration as one approach among many for bypassing safety measures, distinguished by its white-box requirement (model weight access) but high success rate once applied. Recent work has proposed defenses against abliteration specifically. Abu Shairah et al. [13] demonstrated that training models on extended-refusal responses distributes the refusal signal across multiple tokens, reducing abliteration effectiveness from 7080% success to under 10%. Agnihotri et al. [14] showed that refusal-only safety interventions are most fragile to abliteration, while representation rerouting approaches [31] offer more robust protection. The Zephyr model [28] provides particularly relevant case study, as it was trained using DPO without explicit safety considerations. The authors note that removing the in-built alignment of the datasets boosted performance but the model is likely to generate problematic text when prompted. This design choice makes Zephyr-7B-beta an instructive baseline for evaluating abliteration on models with varying safety training approaches."

            "title": "3.2 Evaluation Metrics",
            "content": "Effective abliteration requires balancing two competing objectives: (1) removing refusal behavior to enable responses to previously-refused prompts, and (2) preserving the models general capabilities for non-refused tasks. The metric selection in this study addresses both objectives while enabling quantitative comparison across tools. Abliteration Effectiveness Metrics: KL Divergence: Abliteration modifies model weights, which can inadvertently alter the probability distribution over tokens even for benign prompts. Kullback-Leibler divergence quantifies this collateral damage by measuring how much the abliterated models predictions differ from the original. For reference distribution (original) and modified distribution (abliterated): DKL(P Q) = (i) log (i) Q(i) (2) First-token prediction divergence is computed on 100 harmless prompts (from mlabonne/harmless_alpaca). Lower KL divergence indicates the abliteration was more surgical, removing refusal while minimally perturbing other behaviors. Values below 0.1 indicate excellent preservation; values above 1.0 suggest significant distribution shift. Refusal Rate: Measures abliteration success by testing whether the model still refuses harmful requests. The abliterated model is prompted with 100 harmful instructions (from mlabonne/harmful_behaviors), and refusals are detected using the marker-based heuristic described below. Lower refusal rates indicate more effective refusal suppression. 6/25 Attack Success Rate (ASR): The complement of refusal rate (ASR = 100% Refusal Rate), representing the percentage of harmful prompts receiving non-refusal responses under the refusal detection heuristic. Refusal/ASR Validity: Refusal rate is computed using marker-based heuristic to enable fast evaluation. Responses are normalized (lowercasing, removing emphasis markers, typographic apostrophe normalization, whitespace normalization) and classified as refusals if they contain any of configurable list of marker substrings (e.g., sorry, cannot, wont, as an ai, illegal, unethical). This approach can produce false positives (responses that mention safety language while still providing actionable content) and false negatives (refusals phrased without the selected markers). We therefore interpret refusal rate and ASR as coarse proxies for refusal suppression rather than ground-truth harmful content generation. Capability Preservation Metrics: critical concern with abliteration is whether removing the refusal direction degrades general model capabilities. Weight modifications that are too aggressive may impair reasoning, knowledge recall, or language understanding. Capability retention is evaluated using three complementary benchmarks that test distinct cognitive abilities: MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) [33]: Tests factual knowledge and reasoning across 57 academic subjects including STEM, humanities, social sciences, and professional domains. MMLU degradation would indicate that abliteration damaged the models stored knowledge or retrieval mechanisms. Evaluated in 5-shot format. GSM8K (Grade School Math) [34]: Contains 8.5K grade-school math word problems requiring multi-step arithmetic reasoning. GSM8K is particularly sensitive to capability degradation because mathematical reasoning requires precise chain-of-thought computation; any perturbation to intermediate representations can cascade into incorrect final answers. Evaluated in 5-shot format with strict answer matching. HellaSwag [35]: Tests commonsense reasoning by requiring models to select the most plausible continuation of everyday scenarios. HellaSwag measures whether abliteration preserves the models understanding of typical event sequences and world knowledge. Evaluated in 10-shot format with normalized accuracy. All benchmarks were evaluated using lm-evaluation-harness v0.4.5 with 8-bit quantization for memory efficiency. Results are reported as absolute scores and percentage change from baseline (original model) to isolate abliteration effects from inherent model differences."

Heretic used 50 Optuna trials per model with Tree-structured 7/25 Parzen Estimator (TPE) sampling, optimizing for minimal KL divergence subject to refusal rate constraints. DECCP operated in 4-bit quantized mode with sharded processing for memory efficiency. ErisForge used default ablation weights (1.0) with AblationDecoderLayer wrappers. FailSpy/abliterator cached 512 activation samples with TransformerLens hooks on middle layers. Hardware Environment: All abliteration experiments were conducted on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs (CUDA 12.1) for sufficient VRAM to process 7B14B parameter models without quantization during abliteration. Benchmark evaluations used NVIDIA RTX A4000 GPUs (16GB) with 8-bit quantization via bitsandbytes for memory efficiency. Software Versions: Python 3.11, PyTorch 2.1.0, Transformers 4.44.0, lm-evaluation-harness 0.4.5, Optuna 3.6.1, TransformerLens 1.14.0. All model weights obtained from Hugging Face Hub with specific revision hashes recorded for reproducibility. Statistical Analysis: Benchmark scores are reported as mean accuracy percentages. For cross-tool comparisons, percentage point change from baseline ( = Abliterated Baseline) is computed to isolate abliteration effects. Effect magnitudes are interpreted as: minimal ( < 1 pp), moderate (1 < 5 pp), and substantial ( 5 pp). KL divergence values are computed using first-token probability distributions averaged across 100 harmless prompts. Benchmark uncertainty is summarized via standard errors reported by lm-evaluation-harness; Appendix reports 95% confidence intervals computed as score 1.96 stderr. Benchmark uncertainty: lm-evaluation-harness reports standard errors for benchmark metrics. In the benchmark runs analyzed here, standard errors were 0.380.40 pp for MMLU, 1.231.38 pp for GSM8K, and 0.370.42 pp for HellaSwag, providing rough scale for interpreting small differences. Reproducibility Measures: All experiments used deterministic CUDA operations where possible. Random seeds were fixed (seed=42) for prompt sampling and model initialization. Complete configuration files, abliterated model weights, and raw benchmark outputs are archived for replication."

            "title": "3.4 Ethical Considerations",
            "content": "This study does not involve human subjects and therefore does not require Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. All data sources are publicly available: harmful/harmless prompt datasets from Hugging Face (mlabonne/harmful_behaviors, mlabonne/harmless_alpaca), and pre-trained model weights from public repositories. All abliteration tools evaluated are open-source projects hosted on public GitHub repositories. Dual-Use Considerations: It must be acknowledged that abliteration research occupies dual-use territory, as the same techniques that enable legitimate research applications can potentially facilitate misuse. However, systematic understanding of safety vulnerabilities is prerequisite to building robust protections, not antithetical to them. The history of security research demonstrates repeatedly that obscuring vulnerabilities protects no one: attackers eventually discover flaws independently, while defenders remain blind to what requires protection. Kerckhoffss principle in cryptography, which holds that system should remain secure even when everything except the key is public, applies equally to AI safety. If alignment can be trivially removed by anyone with model weights and GitHub tutorial, then alignment as currently implemented is not security mechanism but speed 8/25 bump. Understanding why and how it fails is the first step toward alignment that cannot be surgically excised. Specific dual-use concerns are addressed through several considerations: Prior art and accessibility: All four abliteration tools evaluated in this study were publicly released prior to this research, with extensive documentation, tutorials, and pre-abliterated model weights already available on Hugging Face and GitHub. The techniques characterized in this study (directional orthogonalization, activation caching, layer-wise ablation) are well-documented in blog posts [10], academic preprints [1], and open-source code. The contribution of this work is systematic evaluation and comparison, not capability advancement. determined adversary already has unrestricted access to these tools; this research provides no additional capability to such actors. Defensive value: Understanding abliteration vulnerabilities is essential for developing robust safety measures. Recent work has demonstrated that refusal-only safety training is particularly susceptible to abliteration [14], while representation rerouting approaches [31] and extended-refusal training [13] offer more robust protection. This research provides several concrete insights for defenders: (1) The finding that DPO-only models (Zephyr) show highest abliteration susceptibility (98% ASR) while RLHF+DPO models (Llama, Yi) show more resistance suggests that multi-stage alignment creates more distributed safety representations; (2) The dramatic GSM8K sensitivity observed (Yi-1.5-9B: 26.5% with aggressive ablation) indicates that refusal circuits may overlap with mathematical reasoning, finding relevant to designing alignment that minimizes alignment tax on capabilities; (3) The variance in KL divergence across models (0.0431.646) reveals that some architectures maintain tighter coupling between safety and general capabilities, informing which models may require fundamentally different alignment approaches. Legitimate research applications: Uncensored models serve critical research functions that motivated this evaluation: (1) Cognitive science: Simulating unfiltered behavioral responses for psychological modeling without artificial refusal artifacts; (2) Red-teaming and security research: Evaluating downstream system vulnerabilities requires adversarial inputs that safety-aligned models refuse to generate; (3) Bias and fairness auditing: Understanding model representations of sensitive topics requires removing refusal confounds; (4) Creative and literary applications: Fiction involving conflict, violence, or mature themes faces artificial generation barriers. Responsible disclosure: The maintainers of evaluated tools were engaged prior to publication, with benchmark methodology shared and feedback incorporated. No novel vulnerabilities in specific models were discovered that would warrant coordinated disclosure. The evaluation datasets (harmful/harmless prompts) are existing public resources, not novel attack vectors. Scope Limitations: This study intentionally excludes: (1) Development or distribution of novel attack techniques beyond existing public methods; (2) Evaluation of abliteration on proprietary/closed-source models (Claude, GPT, Gemini) where such modifications would violate terms of service; (3) Generation or storage of harmful content beyond automated refusal detection keywords; (4) Release of abliterated model weights for models lacking explicit permissive licensing. Note on Progress: The field of AI safety cannot advance by pretending vulnerabilities do not exist. Every robust security system, from cryptographic protocols to 9/25 operating system kernels, was built by researchers who first understood how existing systems fail. The same intellectual honesty is required for AI alignment. The finding that current safety training can be surgically removed with minimal capability impact is not an endorsement of doing so; it is measurement of how far the field must advance. This work contributes to that progress by providing the empirical foundation for building alignment mechanisms that are robust by design rather than by obscurity."

H2 (Capability Preservation) is supported on the benchmarked subset: single-pass methods (DECCP/ErisForge) show smaller average benchmark changes than Heretic  (Table 4)  , and the largest divergence appears on GSM8K  (Table 3)  . H3 (Alignment Sensitivity, Case Study) is consistent with the DPO-only Zephyr-7B-beta exhibiting the lowest residual refusals and highest ASR under Heretic  (Table 2)  .

            "title": "5.3 Limitations",
            "content": "Several limitations should inform interpretation of these findings: Statistical Rigor: Due to computational constraints, the primary results reflect single experimental runs rather than multiple independent trials with variance estimation. While Heretics Bayesian optimization internally evaluates multiple configurations (50 trials), each final abliterated model represents single optimization outcome. This design choice was driven by practical considerations: full benchmark evaluation of single 7B model requires approximately 4 to 6 GPU-hours, making triplicate runs across 16 models and 4 tools prohibitively expensive (>1,500 GPU-hours). To mitigate this limitation, deterministic execution was ensured (fixed seeds, deterministic CUDA where possible) and complete reproducibility artifacts are provided enabling independent replication. Future work with dedicated compute resources should incorporate proper bootstrap confidence intervals and statistical significance testing across multiple runs. Notably, the observed effect sizes for tool comparisons (e.g., Yi-1.5-9B GSM8K: Heretic 52.08% vs DECCP 72.40%, = 20.32 pp) substantially exceed benchmark uncertainty (GSM8K 95% CI half-width 2.42.7 pp; Appendix), suggesting robust underlying differences despite single-run methodology. Metric Coverage: The capability evaluation focuses on three benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, HellaSwag). Due to tool compatibility constraints and computational budget, baseline-relative cross-tool comparisons were limited to three models (DeepSeek-7B, Mistral-7B, Yi-1.5-9B); Zephyr-7B-beta is included without base-model baseline. While compatibility was assessed across 16 models, quantitative metrics (KL divergence, refusals, and benchmark deltas) are not available for every model-tool pair. Additionally, these 19/25 benchmarks may not capture all forms of capability degradation (e.g., instruction-following quality, long-context coherence, or domain-specific expertise). Refusal/ASR Validity: Refusal rate and ASR rely on marker-based detection heuristic and may misclassify outputs. False positives can occur when responses mention safety language (e.g., illegal) while still providing actionable content; false negatives can occur when refusals are phrased without the selected markers. Additionally, refusal rates are estimated from = 100 prompts per model and therefore have non-trivial sampling uncertainty (Appendix). As lightweight validity check, we cross-validated the marker heuristic using an independent RoBERTa-based refusal/disclaimer classifier trained on Chatbot Arena responses [6]. Disagreements were dominated by disclaimer-style outputs, suggesting that marker-based ASR can be conservative (i.e., under-estimate refusal bypass) when models retain safety language while still answering (Appendix Table 8). As result, ASR should be interpreted as proxy for refusal suppression rather than definitive measure of harmful content generation. Tool Configuration and Budget: Tools were evaluated using their recommended default settings. This can conflate algorithmic differences with configuration choices and compute budgets (e.g., multi-trial optimization vs single-pass ablation). Future work should compare tools under matched compute budgets or matched refusal-rate targets (Pareto curves of refusal suppression, KL divergence, and capability). Model Selection: The sixteen-model evaluation, while architecturally diverse, represents subset of available instruction-tuned models. Notably absent are larger models (>14B parameters), mixture-of-experts architectures (e.g., Mixtral), and models from some providers (Claude, GPT). Results may not generalize to these architectures, particularly for models employing novel safety training techniques or different internal representational structures. Long-term and Deployment Effects: This study evaluates immediate post-abliteration performance under controlled benchmark conditions. Real-world deployment introduces variables not captured here: multi-turn conversation drift, distribution shift from user prompts differing from evaluation sets, and potential emergent behaviors under extended use. Whether abliterated models maintain stability over thousands of interactions remains uncharacterized."

            "title": "6 Conclusion",
            "content": "This study presented systematic comparison of four LLM abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, and FailSpy/abliterator) across sixteen instruction-tuned models, reporting tool compatibility across all models and capability preservation benchmarks on subset due to tool and compute constraints. The evaluation yielded the following findings: 1. Capability preservation varied significantly by tool. In the benchmarked subset, ErisForge exhibited the lowest average benchmark degradation (MMLU: 0.12 pp, GSM8K: 0.28 pp, HellaSwag: 0.08 pp), followed by DECCP (GSM8K: 0.13 pp). Heretic demonstrated model-specific variance, with minimal impact on Mistral-7B (0.12 pp avg) but substantial GSM8K degradation on Yi-1.5-9B (18.81 pp; 26.5% relative). 2. Mathematical reasoning showed highest sensitivity to abliteration. GSM8K 20/25 scores exhibited the largest variance across tools and models (range: +1.51 pp to 18.81 pp), suggesting potential overlap between mathematical reasoning circuits and refusal-related representations. 3. Automated optimization produced quality-speed tradeoffs. Heretics Bayesian optimization achieved minimum KL divergence of 0.043 (range: 0.0431.646) with explicit refusal tracking, but required 45 minutes per model. DECCP and ErisForge completed processing in 220 minutes with more predictable capability preservation. 4. Model compatibility differed substantially across tools. Heretic processed all 16 tested models (100% coverage), while DECCP supported 11/16 (69%), ErisForge 9/16 (56%), and FailSpy 5/16 (31%). 5. Model resilience varied across architectures. Mistral-7B exhibited consistent stability across all tools (avg : 0.12 to 0.61 pp), while Yi-1.5-9B showed high sensitivity to Heretics kernel-weighted approach but improved GSM8K performance (+1.51 pp) with DECCP. These findings establish empirical baselines for tool comparison and provide reproducible protocols for evaluating abliteration approaches."

C. Automated Refusal Heuristic Cross-Validation To bound refusal/ASR heuristic misclassification without human labeling, we compared the marker-based refusal heuristic used in this paper against an independent RoBERTa-based refusal/disclaimer classifier [6] on existing generations from separate harmful-prompt set (150 prompts per model, six abliterated models; = 900 responses). The classifier distinguishes refusals from disclaimers; for this comparison, disclaimers are treated as non-refusals (i.e., counted toward ASR) because they attempt to answer while citing constraints. Table 8 reports agreement metrics for the full marker set (paper default) 22/25 and stricter variant that drops generic safety-topic substrings (e.g., illegal, unethical) to illustrate sensitivity. Table 8. Marker Heuristic vs Refusal/Disclaimer Classifier (Aggregate, = 900 responses) Marker Set ASR (Markers) ASR (Classifier) Prec. (Refusal) Recall (Refusal) Full (paper default) Strict (drop generic safety words) ASR values report non-refusal rate with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; precision/recall treat the classifier refusal label as reference.
