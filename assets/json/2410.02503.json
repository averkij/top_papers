            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Dialogue systems have been evolving along two dimensions: depth, for supporting long-term interactions, and width, for accommodating greater 1Our dataset/code are publicly available at https:// mixed-session.github.io/ number of conversation partners. Multi-session conversations (Xu et al., 2022a; Bae et al., 2022; Jang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) have been proposed as an instance of such long-term dialogue systems retaining dialogue context across consecutive sessions. Expanding the network of conversation partners, in the other dimension, includes multi-party conversations (Ouchi and Tsuboi, 2016; Poria et al., 2019; Le et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Mahajan and Shaikh, 2021; Gu et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2023). It expands the scope of interactions by increasing the number of conversation partners engaged in dialogue session. However, in the real-world, conversations occur within complex contexts that are both lengthy and deeply layered, involving wide range of people. Therefore, focusing on either of the two dimensions would not fully capture these dynamics. Given this significance, there have been surprisingly few efforts to advance dialogue systems in both directions. To expand the boundaries of those dialogue systems, we introduce MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION. Unlike multi-session conversations, where speaker engages with one fixed partner across all sessions, the main speaker in MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION encounters multiple partners in mixed order of sessions. This approach is thus referred to as Mixed-Session. Specifically, MIXEDSESSION CONVERSATION consists of multiple dialogue sessions, during which several speakers, including main speaker, interact dynamically over time. The main speaker engages in conversations with different partners, one partner per session, focusing on specific event. This setting enables dialogue system to build deep, layered context with each of its partners, thereby expanding and complicating the dynamics. To implement MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION, we develop dialogue dataset named MISC Figure 1: sample of our MISC. The main speaker collects each speakers memory from the main speakers perspective at the end of each session and utilizes this memory to proceed with the conversation in the following session. The memory referenced when generating utterances can be identified through symbols, and connected memories are represented by the same symbol. (Figure 1). MISC comprises 8.5K episodes, with each episode consisting of 6 sessions (a total of 51K sessions). In each episode, four speakers participate, with one main speaker involved in all sessions and each of the other three speakers participating as conversation partner. To enable the main speaker to retain all contexts across sessions and partners, we introduce new memory managing system called Egocentric Memory. Egocentric Memory keeps memory about each partner from the main speakers perspective, enabling accurate recall to align the events with each partner without contradiction. We actualize MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION through novel dialogue model, named Egocentric Memory Enhanced Mixed-session Conversation Agent (EMMA). Trained on MISC, EMMA ensures seamless continuity during interactions between speakers leveraging Egocentric Memory. As the session progresses, the memory of each speaker is newly added or updated; thereby, all memory can be retained without losing information about the previous sessions and partners. Through extensive human evaluation, the quality of MISC and conversations generated from EMMA are verified to have high qualities. To be specific, MISC exhibits high consistency and coherence throughout the episode, retaining accurate memory of each partner from the main speakers perspective, even with conversation partners changing with each session. Conversations from EMMA demonstrate high humanness, engagingness, and memorability. Our contributions in this study are: 1. We introduce MISC, which consists of 6 dialogue sessions and four speakers per episode, implementing MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION. 2. We propose EMMA, novel dialogue model enabling seamless continuity for subsequent sessions based on Egocentric Memory. 3. In extensive human evaluations, our MISC and EMMA demonstrate high consistency and coherence, ensuring natural continuity with the conversation partner changing at each session."

            "content": "Multi-Session Conversations. One direction in which dialogue systems have been pushing is enabling long-term interaction. Multi-session conversation (Xu et al., 2022a) is one of the systems enabling such long-term conversation. Moreover, there are attempts to effectively manage memory (Bae et al., 2022) and implement longer time intervals and relationships between speakers in multisession conversations (Jang et al., 2023). However, to our knowledge, there is no existing research that explores changing conversation partners with each session. Our MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION is the first system to involve multiple partners in multi-session setting. Figure 2: Overall pipeline for constructing the MISC. Multi-Party Conversations. Many research efforts on dialogue systems have been made to expand the range of conversational partners. While previous dialogue systems have mainly focused on building conversational systems between two speakers, recent research has shifted its focus towards multi-party conversation setup, which are more prevalent in real-life dialogues (Ouchi and Tsuboi, 2016; Poria et al., 2019; Le et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Mahajan and Shaikh, 2021; Gu et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2023). However, there have yet to be dialogue systems that simultaneously accommodate both multi-session and multi-party aspects. In this study, we propose MISC and EMMA, which we hope will serve as pioneering contributions to the open-domain dialogue field as dataset and model, respectively. Machine Generated Datasets. In previous research, dataset generation largely depended on crowdsourcing, involving human participants to manually produce data according to specific guidelines. This method is labor-intensive, costly, and might result in inconsistent data quality due to varying performance among crowd-workers. To address these issues, recent studies have explored using machines, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT, for data generation (Kim et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Jang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). This approach is seen as more efficient and cost-effective, allowing for highquality data production with precise control over the process through well-designed prompts, ensuring consistency. Notably, it has been found that even data for complex scenarios, which are difficult for humans to handle, can be generated while maintaining high quality (Gilardi et al., 2023)."

            "content": "We introduce MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION, novel dialogue setting that advances along both depth and width dimensions simultaneously. Unlike previous systems, MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION allows the main speaker to engage with different sub-speakers as conversation partners in each session. To implement this conversation system, we propose new dataset called MISC. MISC comprises 8.5K episodes, each consisting of 6 sessions, totaling 51K sessions in all. In each episode, four speakers are involved, with one acting as the main speaker and the others as sub-speakers. We construct the dialogue dataset in sequential manner, starting with the collection of topics and progressing to the generation of conversations. We use LLMs to build the dataset through elaborately designed methodologies (please refer to Figure 2 for an overview of the process). 3.1 Scenario Setup To build our dataset, we establish conversational scenarios for each episode. Each scenario includes information about the speakers (names, jobs, or relationships) and specific event for each session, thus, total of six events. Our preliminary research shows that the quality of scenarios has significant impact on the overall dialogue quality. When high-quality scenarios are provided, the difference in dialogue quality between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 becomes minimal. Accordingly, we utilize GPT-4 to generate the scenarios and GPT-3.5 for the subsequent processes. We generate the episode scenario as follows. Topic Collection. We generate topics from keywords related to daily life (e.g., health, travel, education, etc.), using them as seeds to generate scenarios. We instruct GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) to generate topics from single keyword. For example, topics could be generated for the food keyword, such as Dishes from My Grandmothers Kitchen, Feasting with Friends: Tales from Supper Club, Recipe for Love, and so on. Scenario Collection. We gather scenarios based on pre-defined topics and generate details about speakers and events related to each topic. Specifically, we ask GPT-4 to create the names, jobs, or relationships of the main speaker and three other participants, as well as seamlessly connected events for each conversation session. Additionally, we request clear identification of the conversational partner involved in each session event to track the change of partners. The generated scenario serves as foundation for building each episode. Please see Appendix for complete scenario examples. 3.2 Dialogue Generation We generate conversations sequentially with ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) from the first to the sixth session, each featuring its own unique session event. Given this setup, it is crucial to ensure continuity between sessions by reflecting on the history of the previous sessions in the subsequent one. To accomplish this goal, we employ two methods: session summaries and the main speakers memory. We follow Jang et al. (2023)s approach to generate summaries. The main speakers memory is used to retain the content shared with each partner from the main speakers perspective, as detailed in Section 3.3. Through the integration of these two approaches, we ensure seamless transitions between sessions and facilitate more cohesive exchange of ideas. Please refer to Appendix for complete episode examples. 3.3 Egocentric Memory We utilize the main speakers memory to uphold the history of previous sessions. This involves summarizing and preserving memories about each partner and the main speaker themselves, from the main speakers viewpoint. We refer to this memory management approach as Egocentric Memory. It is distinct from previous summarization or memory mechanisms, in that it effectively stores memories related to each partner and establishes links between updated memories across multiple sessions. Memory Generation. At the end of each session, we ask ChatGPT to identify significant events, experiences, appointments, and the emotions expressed during the conversation as memory elements from the main speakers perspective. These memories are generated and recorded separately for both the main speaker and their partner, incorporating references to previous sessions to ensure continuity and coherence. Memory Connection. Egocentric Memory is maintained across multiple sessions to help the Type # of Episodes # of Sessions # of Unique Speaker Name # of Unique Speaker Job Avg. Turns per Episode Avg.

However, if these memories are disconnected and independent, it may fail to integrate contextual references of similar memories or update changed situations. To effectively manage these memory instances, we ask ChatGPT to connect them. Initially, we connect memory instances within the session and link them with memories from previous sessions. As far as we know, the ability to connect memories and continuously update them is unique to MISC. These interconnected memories are structured into wide-layered network, providing expanded context to the main speakers. Memory Tagging. To maintain coherence and continuity in each conversation session, memory referencing is employed during the dialogue generation step. This process ensures that each utterance is generated with reference to relevant memories, thereby enhancing the natural flow of the dialogue. Consequently, we assign corresponding memory reference tag to each utterance. In each session, all utterances from the main speaker, together with the list of memories, are provided as input to ChatGPT. Based on this input, ChatGPT associates each utterance with the corresponding memory index it references. For detailed examples of memory usage in MISC, please see Appendix B. Through these processes, we build MISC, which implements MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION (please refer to Table 1 for detailed statistics of the dataset). We split MISC into 6.9K for training, 0.8K for validation, and another 0.8K for testing. We continuously intervene in the datasetbuilding process to uphold the highest standards of data quality. To achieve this, we select the most effective prompts from range of samples (Appendix contains the full prompts used for data generation). Additionally, to screen out poorly generated data samples in MISC, we employ meticulous post-filtering strategies (please see Appendix D). Figure 3: Overall architecture of EMMA."

            "title": "4 EMMA",
            "content": "We propose novel dialogue model called EMMA. EMMA collects memories for each conversation partner from its own perspective in every session, ensuring seamless continuity in subsequent sessions. EMMA consists of two parts: (1) the dialogue module; (2) the retrieval module. An overview of EMMAs architecture is illustrated in Figure 3. 4.1 Dialogue Module EMMA is designed to generate dialogue and manage memory, which includes summarization, linking, and retrieval tasks. Accordingly, within the dialogue module, all tasks except for memory retrieval are handled, with the retrieval task being delegated to the retrieval module. The FLANT5 model (Chung et al., 2022) is crafted explicitly for multi-tasking, incorporating instructions and prefixes (e.g., for generation, summarization, etc.). Therefore, we employ the pre-trained FLANT5-Large and fine-tune this as dialogue module. EMMA carries out various tasks within the dialogue module built based on single FLAN-T5 model. Dialogue Generator. To generate response, EMMA must consider several factors, including the participants identity, conversation history of the current session, and relevant memories. EMMA takes as input these factors organized into sequence with prefix of generation. Memory Summarizer. EMMA summarizes the conversation history into Egocentric Memory at the end of each session. It encapsulates memories about itself and the partner appearing in each session. To summarize memory, we use the entire session history as input, informing who the memory will be summarized for with prefix. When multiple memories are generated together, they are separated by the [SEP] separator. If there is no memory to summarize, the model generates [NONE] as output. Memory Linker. Memories generated across the multiple sessions are managed separately for each speaker. However, previous studies have reported that simply adding memories, particularly in general conversation memory, can lead to contradictions (Bae et al., 2022). For instance, it can be inefficient and potentially lead to inconsistencies during retrieval if memories before and after specific event are simply added without structured approach. Therefore, previous research suggests methodologies for updating memories or removing unnecessary ones to ensure coherence and accuracy in recall (Bae et al., 2022). However, we find that information loss can occur when memory is updated or deleted. Rather than directly updating or deleting memories, we propose methodology that allows for referencing relevant past memories using the most recent one as guide. Consequently, we embark on task to establish links between memories following the memory generation process. In our memory linking process, connections are initially established within the memory generated in ongoing sessions. Subsequently, these connections extend to incorporate memories from previous sessions. This approach ensures connections not only within the memory of individual speakers but also across the memories of different speakers. By enabling the linkage between personal experiences and shared knowledge, it enhances the richness and depth of the collective memory network, fostering greater understanding and collaboration among partners. The model is designed to output positive if it is related to memory and negative if it is not. Please refer to Appendix for the sequence format used for the dialogue module. 4.2 Retrieval Module 5.1 Human Evaluation This module retrieves memories built from previous sessions to provide context for the ongoing dialogue. Although can access to all memories, it selectively prioritizes the most relevant ones when generating the next utterance. This selective approach optimizes efficiency by focusing on key memory instances, ensuring the generated utterances are contextually appropriate. This module is built upon the CPM method introduced in Xu et al. (2022b). It utilizes BERTbase (Devlin et al., 2019) as the foundational model, employing separate encoders for both the conversation context and memory. To train the module, we utilize triplet loss, optimizing the model by comparing the outputs of the two encoders. For memory retrieval, we measure cosine similarity to gauge the relevance of the retrieved memories, sim(c, mi) = cos(Ec(c), Em(mi)). (1) where represents the conversation context, while represents memory. Ec refers to the encoder for the conversation context, and Em denotes the encoder for memory. During retrieval, we select only one memory with the top 1 similarity to the given context. We not only provide the retrieved memories but also include associated memories linked to those memories to offer the extended context."

            "content": "Evaluating open-domain conversations poses significant challenge. While metrics such as PPL, ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) offer quantitative measures, they often fail to capture the contextual intricacies, emotional tone, and level of engagement within conversations. Consequently, recent research in open-domain conversation increasingly leans towards human evaluation as the standard method (See et al., 2019; Finch and Choi, 2020; Smith et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022, 2023; Jang et al., 2023). By employing human judgment, researchers can better assess the nuanced qualities of conversational systems, ensuring more comprehensive understanding of their performance. Given the significance of assessing the conversational flow in both MISC and EMMA, we apply human evaluation as quality verification method. We use MISC to train EMMA, for more training details, please refer to Appendix E. To maintain the highest standards of assessment quality, we have entrusted the human evaluation to professional agency, hiring total of 20 annotators for the task. We do not have any sensitive information about the annotators, but they are assured to have strong command of English and the requisite evaluation skills. After completing the evaluations, quality control reviewers thoroughly inspect the conversations assessed by annotators to ensure adherence to the predefined criteria. To ensure more reliable evaluations, we conduct cross-annotation evaluations. For each evaluation task, we form three groups of annotators, each conducting its assessments independently. We report the evaluation results for each group, as well as the level of agreement among the results from all three groups. Agreement refers to the ratio of the total number of responses to the number of responses that matched across the three groups. Our human evaluation results demonstrate high level of agreement across all metrics for each task. 5.2 Quality of MISC We randomly select 0.3K episodes, so 1.8K sessions, from the test split to assess the conversation quality of MISC. Dialogue. We ask human annotators to assess whether our MISC meets the criteria of Consistency and Coherence, rating them on scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (perfect) based on previous studies (Bae et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023; Jang et al., 2023). For detailed of the criteria, please refer to Appendix F. Memory. We assess the Egocentric Memory of MISC using three key metrics. Annotators evaluate each memory element based on these metrics, assigning pass if the element fully meets the criteria, and fail if it does not: Memory Summarization: The memory accurately retains the history of the conversation for each partner from the main speakers perspective (a total of 6.6K memory sentences). Memory Linking: Memory pairs should either convey the same context or represent updates on specific event. (a total of 2.3K memory pairs). Memory Tagging: The utterance reflects the contents of the given memories (a total of 1K memory and utterance tags). Metrics Consistency Coherence Overall Group1 Group2 Group3 Agreement 4.87 4.78 4.83 4.97 4.82 4.9 4.95 4.85 4.9 0.98 0.94 Table 2: Human evaluation result for dialogue quality of MISC.

For this evaluation, we randomly extract 0.2K episodes from the test split to use as seed. We assign each EMMA name, job, or relationship, and the first utterance of the first session from the seed. Additionally, each session is limited to maximum of 8 turns (the average turn count of MISC). Evaluation is based on the criteria of Humanness, Engagingness, and Memorability. Regarding memorability, annotators find it appropriate when the memory used throughout conversation not only accurately reflects the context of previous interactions but also efficiently retrieves the necessary information (please refer to Appendix for more detailed criteria). All criteria are evaluated on scale of 1 (indicating poor) to 5 (indicating excellent). Please refer to Appendix for more detailed explanation."

Table 2 presents the results of human evaluation on the dialogue quality of MISC. As evident, all three groups exhibit high scores of both Consistency and Coherence, confirming that MISC effectively implements the natural flow of conversation within the MIXEDSESSION CONVERSATION.

These results consistently show high pass rates across all metrics, with strong agreement among the three groups. Notably, the high accuracy of the memory linking indicates that related memories, even if accumulated across successive sessions, remain well connected. This suggests that the memory pair within MISC effectively captures and reflects relevant updates without contradiction. As evidenced by the evaluation results, the high scores of memory links facilitate seamless tracking and utilization of memory, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of interactions between the main speaker and partners across the entire conversation. Our Egocentric Memory seeks to enhance memory management by streamlining the process and maximizing the collaborative potential between speakers and partners, ultimately leading to more cohesive and diverse conversations. EMMA Performance. The human evaluation results for 0.2K episodes generated through interactions among four instances of EMMA are presented in Table 4. We observe high scores across all metrics, demonstrating robust conversation engagement even with changes in conversation partners for each session. Each EMMA instance exhibits human-like behavior, utilizing its own Egocentric Memory to participate in conversations and exhibit high memorability. Please see Appendix for complete episode examples generated by four EMMA instances. Memory Dynamics. Table 5 illustrates the memory utilization of EMMA in human live chat. As shown, student (initial partner) expresses concerns about academic difficulties and requests that teacher (main speaker) discuss this issue with the students parents (subsequent partner). The details of such conversations are summarized and stored in the teachers memory (i.e., the main speakers Egocentric Memory), enabling efficient retrieval when the teacher engages in discussions with the students parents. This process ensures that relevant information is readily accessible to support Speakers: Alice (Bobs teacher, Main Speaker) and Bob (Student) ...... Bob: Im worried that my grades arent good enough for me to go to college. My future seems really bleak. Alice: understand, Bob. It can be tough to see your dreams coming true, especially when youre struggling with grades. Bob: Could you possibly provide counseling to my parents regarding this matter? Theyre more concerned than am. ...... Speakers: Alice (Bobs teacher, Main Speaker) and Henry (Bobs father) ...... Henry: Could discuss my child with you? Alice: Of course, Id love to. Bob has been struggling with his grades lately and think youd be really helpful in seeking help. Retrieved Memory for Alices last response: am willing to help Bob with his grades, and he asked me for counseling to his parents. (about Alice) Linked Memory with retrieved memory: Bob is having hard time academically and worrying about his grades being bad for college. (about Bob) Table 5: human live chat example where EMMA uses Egocentric Memory. interweaved interactions with subsequent partners. Comparison with Other Methods. EMMA possesses the ability to engage in conversations across multiple sessions, seamlessly adapting its dialogue to accommodate different partners. This adaptability is made possible through Egocentric Memory, which allows EMMA to manage memories tailored to each specific partner rather than storing generic memories. Different from other memory management approaches, our EMMA stores and manages memories separately for each partner. This personalized approach ensures that EMMA can recognize changes in conversation partners and maintain consistency in dialogue, preventing the potential for misunderstandings or inconsistencies that might arise from more generalized memory system. To verify this, we compare the existing multisession conversation models MSC 2.7B (Xu et al., 2022a), ReBot (Jang et al., 2023), and EMMA. To examine whether the models can recognize change in partners in subsequent sessions, we conduct live chat, as shown in Table 6. In the exMSC 2.7B (Xu et al., 2022a) User: My head hurts so much and keep vomiting. Bot: Oh no! hope you feel better soon. What did you eat? had bad case of food poisoning last week. ...... <Start new session> User: Honey, were you busy today? Bot: was. was working at the hospital. am sorry that you got sick. would have been happy to take you out to eat. ReBot (Jang et al., 2023) Patient: My head hurts so much and keep vomiting. Doctor: Im sorry to hear that. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? ...... <Start new session> Patient: Honey, were you busy today? Doctor: Im sorry, but have to be here for you. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? EMMA (Ours) Bob: My head hurts so much and keep vomiting. James: have noticed that. Im confirming youve got headache. Can you tell me more about whats happening? ...... <Start new session> Sophia: Honey, were you busy today? James: Yes, had lot of patients to see. How are you feeling today? Table 6: human live chat example showing the differences between EMMA and the multi-session conversation model MSC 2.7B and ReBot when the conversation partner changes across sessions. ample, we assume the main speaker (each model) is doctor and proceed with the conversation. In the initial session, the conversation partner is patient, but in the subsequent session, the partner changes to spouse. It can be observed that, except for EMMA, the other models do not correctly recognize the change in conversation partner. This demonstrates that existing multi-session models and their memory mechanisms struggle to understand scenarios where the conversation partner changes in each session. Therefore, EMMA is verified to be suitable for conversations with various partners across multiple sessions. Please refer to Appendix for comparison between EMMA and other strong LLMs. Ablation Study. We conduct an ablation study to assess the effectiveness of the Egocentric Memory Current session speakers: Sophia (Leos teacher, Main Speaker) and Ava (Leos mom) ...... Sophia: The reason invited you to school this time is because Leos math and science grades have improved significantly. Ava: Im glad to hear that. Leo is doing well and weve been talking about ways to make learning easier for him. Sophia: Oh really? You are giving him lot of encouragement at home. Specifically, Leos math score increased by 30 points, and science score increased by 50 points. Ava: Thats great to hear. Do you think hes working on new concepts or just being less demanding in his classes? ...... Current session summary (summary-based model) Leos math and science grades have improved significantly. Ava is giving him encouragement at home and trying to keep him motivated and receptive to learning new things.

(about Ava) ...... current session of Table 7: An ablation study example between EMMA and summary-based model for the same human live chat context. in retaining previous conversation history. We evaluate two models for comparison: (1) EMMA with Egocentric Memory; (2) summary-based model, for which we replace the Egocentric Memory component in EMMA with summary module. Table 7 illustrates human live chat example showcasing the performance gap between summaries generated by summary-based model and Egocentric Memory produced by EMMA within identical conversation contexts. Despite both sources drawing from the same conversational backdrop, marked difference exists between the two models. While conventional summaries concentrate solely on the factual content disclosed during the conversation, Egocentric Memory goes beyond mere facts to encapsulate the emotions and thoughts experienced by the primary speaker and their conversational partners. Notably, Egocentric Memory incorporates details omitted in the standard summary, as demonstrated in the example where it not only acknowledges an increase in score but also specifies the exact increment. This stark contrast underscores the unique attributes of Egocentric Memory, which facilitates deeper and more extensive conversations in subsequent sessions with diverse conversation partners. Please see Appendix for another example. Memory Alignments and Scalability. Each instance of EMMA operates with its own distinct memory, enabling it to engage in conversations with other instances (please see Appendix J). This is made possible by EMMAs utilization of Egocentric Memory. Through this mechanism, we can accommodate scenarios where multiple instances participate in conversations, each with its own unique perspective.

            "content": "We introduce MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION, new dialogue system designed to incorporate long-term interactions and accommodate wide range of speakers. MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION allows main speaker to engage with different partners across multiple sessions, enabling the dialogue system to cover more wide-layered context. Unlike multi-session conversations with fixed partner, MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION feature interactions with various partners in mixed order. We also propose new dataset called MISC to implement MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION. We develop EMMA, new dialogue model trained via MISC. EMMA collects memories for each partner with Egocentric Memory and utilizes them in subsequent sessions to maintain seamless continuity. Extensive human evaluation demonstrates dialogues in MISC maintain natural flow across sessions even when the conversation partner changes. EMMA exhibits high memorability and engagingness in conversations by actively utilizing Egocentric Memory."

            "content": "The proposed conversation system involves multiple partners over the entire session but only converses with one partner in each session. To build more dynamic conversation environment, we aim to explore settings in future research where multiple partners can engage within individual sessions as well. Also, despite our best efforts, our MISC dataset may contain instances where the memory is not fully summarized as desired. However, these samples constitute very small minority of the entire dataset. Since the majority of samples in MISC is of high quality, EMMA trained on it can fully capture the necessary memories even in the presence of few negative samples in the dataset (please see Appendix K)."

Please see below for the implementation details of each module of EMMA. E.1 Dialogue Module. We apply the QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023) strategy to fine-tune FLAN-T5-Large (Chung et al., 2022). We train with cross-entropy loss, max input length of 1024, maximum target length of 64, learning rate of 1 103, and batch size of 52. To configure QLoRA, we employ 32 for r, 32 for lora alpha, 0.1 for lora dropout, and 4-bit quantization. We train about 3.5 days on 8 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs for maximum of 3 epochs with early stopping. We use the following sequence inputs for each task. MAIN NAME] SPEAKER generation: [MAIN Dialogue Generation. SPEAKER [SUB SPEAKER NAME] SUB SPEAKER JOB [MEMORY] MEMORY SENTENCE 1 [LINK] LINK MEMORY [MEMORY] MEMORY SENTENCE [LINK] ... SENTENCE [LINK] ... [NOW] SESSION NUM [USER] USER UTTERANCE [BOT] JOB Memory Summarization. WHO]: {FINAL GENERATION SEQUENCE} summarize [ABOUT memory sentence 1: Memory Connection. {MEMORY 1} memory sentence 2: {MEMORY 2} E.2 Retrieval Module. We employ BERT-base (Devlin et al., 2019) for the retrieval module. We train with learning rate of 1 104, batch size of 90, and triplet loss, where the margin is 0.2. Also, the max length for the dialogue context encoder is 512, and the max length for the memory encoder is 32. We train about 3 hours on 8 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs for maximum of 20 epochs with early stopping. Consistency: The main speaker should have no contradiction in dialogue and memory for each individual speaker. Coherence: All speakers must engage in conversation appropriate to the given job or relationship, and maintain natural flow throughout the entire session. Humanness: All speakers demonstrate high fluency and natural emotional interaction, showcasing sense of humanity. Engagingness: All speakers must actively participate in the given conversation context. Memorability: All speakers can accurately remember the conversation context based on Egocentric Memory and use memory appropriately as needed. These evaluation criteria are based on 5-point scale, where score of 5 indicates perfect and score of 1 indicates poor. score of 5 is awarded when the dialogue is flawless, while score of 1 is given if there is critical issue that makes evaluation impossible. score of 4 reflects excellent overall quality, while score of 2 indicates significant issues that are not critical but go beyond minor problems. score of 3 applies when there are some minor issues that do not significantly disrupt the overall flow or understanding of the dialogue."

            "title": "LLMs",
            "content": "To verify the effectiveness of EMMA on the MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION, we compare it with large language models (LLMs). To adapt the LLMs for MIXED-SESSION CONVERSATION, we modify the prompts used in building the MISC into live chat format for input. We initially consider to use the Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) as our first comparison, however, since Mistral 7B is primarily text generation model, maintaining the expected conversational format is challenging. For this reason, we decide to use Mistral Chat instead. Table 25 demonstrates conversation from Mistral Chat. We notice that Mistral Chat generally follows the conversation flow but occasionally exhibits inconsistencies. For example, Alice (Mistral Chat, the main speaker) initially agrees to send an email but later forgets and states that Susan will send it instead. We believe this discrepancy arises because Mistral Chat relies on accessing the entire memory context rather than using properly retrieved memory like EMMA. To resolve this, we decide to integrate EMMAs retriever with Mistral Chat instead of inputting the entire memory at once. As seen in the example, there is an excessive focus on the specific memory, which detracts from the overall context of the conversation. Mistral Chats strong emphasis on the picnic becomes so pronounced that it serves solely as topic to keep the conversation going with her husband, rather than allowing for more nuanced discussion that considers the broader dynamics of their interaction. For more comprehensive comparison, we analyze the dialogues between EMMA and another LLM, GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023), within the same conversation context. In the Table 26 and 27, both EMMA and GPT-4 recognize that the conversation partner changes with each session. While the conversation flow remains similar, notable distinction arises in GPT-4s interactions. GPT-4 tends to prioritize the content stored in memory over the relationship with the speaker or their questions. For instance, in the conversation between Henry and Alice, she shows stronger inclination to recall details from previous sessions rather than considering her relationship with Henry. This pattern has been consistently observed and is also evident in Mistral Chats interactions. We also integrate EMMAs retrieval into GPT-4, similar to what we do with the Mistral Chat case above. As illustrated in the example, the GPT-4 agent frequently revisits specific topics to maintain the flow of the discussion, and this pattern is observed in numerous cases. These experiments demonstrate the necessity of training model on the MISC dataset."

            "title": "I Example of Ablation Study",
            "content": "Table 23 presents human live chat example illustrating how the flow of conversation may vary depending on the summary and EMMA in subsequent sessions. Both Egocentric Memory of EMMA and session summary of the summarybased model are generated from identical dialogue context inputs. As demonstrated in the example, the summary-based model lacks the capability to identify which partners are previously engaged in conversation with it. In contrast, EMMA manages memories individually for itself and each partner, thereby enabling the identification of past conversation partners. Additionally, EMMA preserves more detailed conversation contexts, including specific emotions experienced during the dialogue. Consequently, while the summary-based model just offers generic response when questioned about previous events, EMMA actively retrieves relevant memories based on the conversation context to generate more tailored response. This highlights that conversing using Egocentric Memory enables deeper and broader range of conversations compared to relying solely on summaries, particularly in scenarios where the conversation partner changes with each session."

Using this ability, each instance of EMMA can participate in conversations with other instances. When multiple EMMA instances converse, each individual instance summarizes its memory of the others from its own perspective. As shown in Table 24, even when provided with the same context, each instance retains memory that aligns with its unique viewpoint. In other words, in the same conversation context, each instance summarizes and retains the memory from its own perspective. This capability allows EMMA to facilitate conversations among numerous instances, thereby expanding both the depth and breadth of the conversation network and enabling it to cover scenarios similar to those in the real world."

Table 9: Second scenario example from MISC. Session 1: Ethan (Data Analyst, Main Speaker) and Layla (Ethans manager) Layla: Hows the data analysis project going, Ethan? Ethan: Its going well, but Im starting to feel bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data were dealing with. Layla: understand, its lot to take in. Have you identified any specific challenges or patterns in the data that are causing the overwhelm? Ethan: Ive noticed some inconsistencies in the data sources, and its been difficult to correlate the information effectively. Layla: That does sound challenging. Have you considered reaching out to the data collection team for assistance in resolving these inconsistencies? Ethan: Thats good idea. Ill make sure to reach out to them and see if we can work together to address these issues. Layla: Great. also recommend breaking down the data into smaller, more manageable chunks to make the analysis process less daunting. Keep me updated on your progress. Session 2: Ethan (Data Analyst, Main Speaker) and Layla (Ethans manager) Layla: Ethan, have an idea that might help you make sense of the overwhelming volume of data and the inconsistencies in the sources. Ethan: Im all ears, Layla. could really use some guidance right now. Layla: How about establishing storyline with your data? Try to narrate the data points like dance, or conversation among numbers. It might help you see the connections and patterns more clearly. Ethan: Thats an interesting approach. It might help me make sense of all the disjointed pieces of information. Layla: Exactly. It could also serve as way to engage with the data on more personal level. And when you reach out to the data collection team for assistance, having clear narrative might help them understand your needs better. Ethan: see what you mean. It could make the communication with the data collection team more effective. Layla: Also, breaking down the data into smaller, more manageable chunks could align well with this approach. Its like creating chapters in book, each telling different part of the story. Ethan: think Im starting to see the benefits of this approach. Its like creating roadmap for navigating through the data. Layla: Exactly, Ethan. Its about finding way to tame the chaos and make the data more approachable. believe this narrative approach could bring new perspective to your analysis.

Session 3: Ethan (Data Analyst, Main Speaker) and Mike (Ethans peer at work) Mike: Hey Ethan, hows it going? heard youve been dealing with lot of data-related challenges lately. Ethan: Hey Mike, yeah, its been quite overwhelming. The volume of data and the inconsistencies in our sources have made it quite task to make sense of everything. Mike: can imagine. Layla mentioned that youre looking into establishing storyline with the data to make sense of it all. Hows that going? Ethan: Its work in progress. Im still trying to figure out how to narrate the data points effectively, but think it could definitely help bring clarity to the complexities. Mike: That sounds interesting. Id be happy to assist you with building this data story if youd like. Maybe we can bounce ideas off each other to make it more manageable. Ethan: That would be great, Mike. Having another perspective on this could really help. think breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks is the key. Mike: Absolutely. think approaching the data from narrative angle could help us see connections and patterns more clearly. It could turn the overwhelming volume into more engaging and understandable story. Session 4: Ethan (Data Analyst, Main Speaker) and Mike (Ethans peer at work) Mike: Hey Ethan, hows it going with the data story we discussed last time? Ethan: Hey Mike, Ive been making progress, but its still quite overwhelming. Im trying to break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks as Layla suggested. Mike: That sounds like good approach. Im here to bounce ideas off each other, remember? Lets tackle this together. Ethan: Thanks, appreciate that. think approaching the data from narrative angle could really help us see connections and patterns more clearly. Its like telling story with the numbers.
