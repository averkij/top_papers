Recent reasoning-reinforced models, including OpenAIs o-series, DeepSeek-R1, and QwQ-32B, outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks 3,4, attributed to extended test-time computation through longer chains of thought 5. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from the implicit simulation of complex, multi-agent-like interactionsa society of thoughtwhich enables the deliberate diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis using classified outputs and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces 6,7, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than baseline and merely instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personalityand expertiserelated features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviours including question-answering sequences, perspective shifts, and reconciliation of conflicting views, as well as in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversation, which together account for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks through both direct and indirect facilitation of cognitive strategies 8,9. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments further reveal that base models spontaneously increase conversational behaviours when solely rewarded for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding substantially accelerates reasoning improvement compared to base models and models fine-tuned with monologue-like reasoning. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups 1012, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured and suggest new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have undergone remarkable transformation in recent years, with large language models (LLMs) demonstrating increasingly sophisticated abilities across domains, from mathematics and code to scientific and creative writing to critical decision support 1,2. Nevertheless, persistent challenge has been the development of robust reasoning capabilitiesthe ability to methodically analyze problems, consider alternatives, detect errors, and arrive at reliable conclusions. Recent reasoning models, such as DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, and OpenAIs o-series models (o1, o3, o4), are trained by reinforcement learning to think before they respond, generating lengthy chains of thought. This led to substantial improvement in reasoning accuracy compared to existing instructiontuned language models (e.g., DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-2.5, GPT-4.1) 3,4. Yet, the character of thinking within reasoning models that drives success remains underexplored. We propose that reasoning models learn to emulate social, multi-agent-like dialogue between multiple perspectiveswhat we term society of thoughtto improve their reasoning, given the centrality of social interaction to the development of reason in both cognitive and social scientific accounts. Mercier and Sperbers Enigma of Reason argument posits that human reasoning evolved primarily as social process, with knowledge emerging through adversarial reasoning and engagement across differing viewpoints 10. Empirical work supports the idea that groups outperform individuals on wide range of Corresponding author: James Evans (jamesaevans@google.com; jevans@uchicago.edu) Work done as student researcher at Google Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought reasoning tasks by pooling information, calibrating confidence, and exhibiting collective intelligence through balanced turn-taking among diverse perspectives 1215. Cognitive diversity, stemming from variation in expertise and personality traits, enhances problem solving, particularly when accompanied by authentic dissent 11,1622. Together, these findings suggest that robust reasoning emerges through interaction and the integration of diverse perspectives, and that key reasoning strategies, including verification and backtracking, may be realized through the conversation of simulated personas. While diversity and debate contribute directly to collective intelligence, many theories further suggest that individuals reason better when they simulate this capacity. single, self-centered perspective can lead to systematic biases in reasoning; if individuals effectively simulate multiple, self-distanced perspectives with their minds, as in dialectical thinking, this can reduce decision biases within them 2325. The social brain hypothesis suggests that higher-order intelligence primarily evolved to meet the cognitive demands of processing and simulating social interactions 26,27. Individuals who simulate others differing perspectives through improved theory-of-mind capabilities enhance collective team performance 18. Furthermore, theorists have argued that individual reason itself emerged from simulation of collective discourse. Bakhtins notion of the dialogic self and Cooley and Meads theory of the looking glass self argue that human thought itself takes the form of an internalized conversation among multiple perspectives 28? 30. Even in the history of artificial intelligence, Minsky conceptualized intelligence as an emergent property of interacting cognitive agents, or Society of Mind 31. Therefore, whether AI systems directly simulate multi-agent discourse or simulate minds that, in turn, simulate multi-agent discourse, we propose that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 improve reasoning via society of thoughtimplicit simulations of multi-agent-like interactions between diverse perspectives that give rise to them. We use the term to denote text generation that simulates social exchange among multiple perspectives to increase the collective diversity of ideas through conversational roles that put them in competition. Without deploying separate models prompted to interact with one another 3234, we suggest that behaviourally similar conversations between diverse perspectives occur and are leveraged within reasoning models. Reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 develop reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning, which iteratively compensates reasoning behaviour that yields correct answers. Following these performance improvements, debates have naturally arisen about what kinds of behaviours contribute to better reasoning performance. While earlier studies focus on how the model learns to scale testtime computations and generate longer reasoning traces 2,35, merely increasing trace length does not account for the observed improvements in reasoning capabilities. This suggests that qualitative changes in reasoning structure matter more than quantitative scaling alone 3537. Recent analyses pinpoint behavioural patterns that improve reasoning accuracy, such as verification of earlier assumptions, backtracking, and exploration of alternatives 4,8,3537. Mechanistic interpretability research has shown that features in language models such as the frequent use of words like wait, but, and however are associated with these behaviours 3841. The characteristics of these features, however, such as their prevalence in social and conversational settings, have rarely been explored. Research in other contexts has suggested that the simulation of multi-agent conversations can boost accuracy and divergent thinking in LLMs 34,4247. While LLMs can exhibit cognitive biases that hinder reasoning, the simulation of interaction between different perspectives could mitigate biases when verified through checks and balances 34,48,49. This leads us to hypothesize that reinforcement learning may systematically select and reward behaviour patterns that resemble multi-agent interactions within reasoning models, and these simulated interactions enable models to reason effectively. Here we investigate the prevalence of reasoning traces of DeepSeek-R1, as well as QwQ-32B, that mimic simulated social interactions, quantifying how conversational behaviours, socio-emotional Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought roles, and diversity of implicit agent perspectives contribute to reasoning performance. We first identify whether conversational behaviours and socio-emotional roleshallmarks of human dialogue such as questioning, perspective taking, and reconciliationare present in DeepSeek-R1s and QwQ32Bs reasoning traces. Then we test whether conversational behaviour contributes to reasoning performance. Based on the mechanistic interpretability method applied to DeepSeek-R1s distilled model (DeepSeek-R1-Llama-8B), we find that steering features associated with discourse marker, such as expressing surprise in conversational contexts, improves reasoning accuracy both directly and indirectly through the facilitation of cognitive strategies. Next, we analyze the diversity of reasoning perspectives or simulated voices within DeepSeek-R1s and QwQ-32Bs reasoning traces. Literature suggests that LLM reasoning can fail if models do not engage in meaningful disagreement and instead conform to misleading initial claims through pleasant, sycophantic conversations that propagate incorrect assumptions and knowledge 4951. Successful reasoning models may therefore exhibit disagreement driven by diversity in simulated perspectives, expressed through distinct personalities and expertise to avoid the echo chamber that leads to wrong answers. Therefore, we analyze reasoning traces using LLM-as-judge to accurately identify distinct voices underlying conversation. We find that DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B display much greater personality and expertise diversity than non-reasoning models within their reasoning traces, presumably to maximize the benefits of multi-agent-like interaction through diversification. We further find that steering conversational feature in models activation space leads to the activation of more diverse range of personalityand expertise-related features. Finally, we conduct controlled reinforcement learning experiment to examine the role of conversational behaviours. We focus on self-taught reinforcement learning that rewards only accuracy and correct formatting (i.e., wrapping the thinking process between <think> and </think>), the common approach for improving modern language models reasoning capabilities 4. Based on symbolic arithmetic task (Countdown game) 8,52, as well as misinformation identification task, we apply reinforcement learning that rewards reasoning traces leading to accurate answers on open-source LLMs. Interestingly, experiments reveal that the base model can spontaneously develop conversational behaviourssuch as self-questioning and perspective shiftswhen rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, without any explicit training signal for dialogue structure. Moreover, following methods of prior ablation research 8, we observe that initially fine-tuning these models for conversational structure leads to faster accuracy improvements, outperforming both their baseline counterparts and models fine-tuned with monologue-like reasoning, particularly during the early stages of training in two distinct model systems (Qwen-2.5-3B and Llama-3.2-3B). These results suggest that conversational scaffolding facilitates the discovery and refinement of reasoning strategies during reinforcement learning."

            "content": "We compile suite of widely used benchmarks used in prior research and official model cards of reasoning models (BigBench Hard, GPQA, MATH (Hard), MMLU-Pro, MUSR, and IFEval) 3,4, spanning symbolic logic, mathematical problem solving, scientific reasoning, multi-agent inference, and instruction following tasks (see Methods: Data). From this pool, we sample 8,262 problems and generate reasoning traces using DeepSeek-R1-0528 (671B parameters; hereafter DeepSeek-R1) and QwQ-32B. For comparison, we also generate reasoning traces using conventional, instruction-tuned models of varying sizes: DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B parameters; hereafter DeepSeek-V3), Qwen-2.532B-Instruct (hereafter Qwen-2.5-32B-IT; the instruction-tuned model based on Qwen-2.5-32B from which QwQ-32B is derived), Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (hereafter Llama-3.3-70B-IT), and Llama-3.18B-Instruct (hereafter Llama-3.1-8B-IT) 53,54. DeepSeek-V3 is the instruction-tuned model based on 3 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought DeepSeek-V3-base from which DeepSeek-R1 is derived, and Qwen-2.5-32B-IT is the instruction-tuned model based on Qwen-2.5-32B from which QwQ-32B is derived (see Methods: Data) 53,54. Next, we estimate behavioural differences between reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B) and the instruction-tuned models. We use linear probability models with problem-level fixed effects, which control for all task-specific characteristics, such as the difficulty of tasks. Specifically, we compare each reasoning model with its corresponding instruction-tuned counterpart (i.e., DeepSeekR1 vs. DeepSeek-V3; QwQ-32B vs. Qwen-2.5-3B-IT) on the presence of conversational behaviours and socio-emotional roles. We control for log-transformed reasoning trace length (Extended Data Fig. 1) to consider that observed differences are not merely driven by longer chains of thought that is, we demonstrate that reasoning models exhibit more frequent conversational behaviours and socio-emotional roles even when trace lengths are similar (see Methods: Statistical analyses). Conversational Behaviours and Socio-Emotional Roles We begin by investigating whether conversational behaviours and socio-emotional roles constitutive of back-and-forth dialogue are prevalent in reasoning traces. Using an LLM-as-judge, we quantify the occurrence of four conversational behavioursdefined as behaviours signaling the simulation of exchanges among multiple perspectives to explore given problemwithin each reasoning trace: (1) questionanswering, in which the trace poses and then resolves questions; (2) perspective shifts, where alternative viewpoints are explored; (3) conflicts of perspectives, in which competing viewpoints are sharply contrasted; and (4) reconciliation, where conflicting viewpoints are integrated and coherently resolved. We also examine socio-emotional roles based on Bales Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) 55. This identifies 12 interaction roles grouped into four categories: (1) asking for orientation, opinion, and suggestion, (2) giving orientation, opinion, and suggestion, (3) negative emotional roles (disagreement, antagonism, tension), and (4) positive emotional roles (agreement, solidarity, tension release), which together characterize interactive group activity. These behaviours are annotated using an LLM-asjudge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) that shows substantial agreement with both human rater (average ICC(3,1) = .756) and another LLM (GPT-5.2; average ICC(3,1) = .875) (see Methods: Measurements and Supplementary Method: LLM-as-judge prompts (Conversational behaviours and Socioemotional roles)). To illustrate how reasoning traces are annotated, we provide examples in Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Methods: Annotation Examples. In an organic chemistry problem requiring multistep reaction analysis to identify the final products structure (i.e., multi-step Diels-Alder synthesis), DeepSeek-R1 exhibits perspective shifts and conflict, expressed through socio-emotional roles such as disagreement, giving opinion, and giving orientation (e.g., But here, its cyclohexa-1,3-diene, not benzene. Another possibility: the high heat might cause the ketone to lose CO or something, but unlikely.). In contrast, DeepSeek-V3s trace on the same problem shows no conflict of perspectives, no perspective shifts, and no disagreementonly giving opinions and orientations in monologic sequence without self-correction, concluding with 8 is reasonable estimate, the wrong answer, as consequence of incomplete reasoning. In creative sentence rewriting task, DeepSeek-R1 debates competing stylistic proposals through conflict of perspectives, as well as socio-emotional roles such as disagreement and giving suggestion: But that adds deep-seated which wasnt in the original. We should avoid adding new ideas. Wait, thats not word. But note: cast can be less forceful than flung. So lets use hurled. DeepSeek-V3, by contrast, shows minimal conflict and no disagreement, producing suggestions without the iterative refinement observed in DeepSeek-R1. As shown in Fig. 1a, we quantify the occurrence of four conversational behaviours within each reason4 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought Fig. 1. Conversational behaviours and Bales socio-emotional roles in chain-of-thought reasoning. a, Proportion of reasoning traces containing each conversational behaviour (question answering, perspective shift, conflict of perspectives, and reconciliation). b, Proportion of Bales twelve socio-emotional roles expressed in reasoning traces, grouped into four higher-level categories: ask versus give information, and positive versus negative emotional roles (see Extended Data Fig. 3 for definitions of all twelve roles). c, Jaccard index measuring the balance of each socio-emotional role pair, defined as the number of reasoning traces containing both roles divided by the number containing either role (i.e., ask & give; positive & negative). d, Distribution of the number of distinct perspectives in reasoning traces, identified using an LLM-as-judge. e, Differences in problem complexity by the presence of conversational behaviours and higher-level socio-emotional roles in DeepSeek-R1, measured on seven-point Likert scale (1 = extremely easy; 7 = extremely difficult) using an LLM-as-judge.

Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. 5 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought ing trace, and report the proportion of traces exhibiting more than one such behaviour. DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit conversational behaviours far more frequently than instruction-tuned models. DeepSeek-R1 shows significantly more questionanswering (𝛽 = 0.345, 95% CI = [0.328, 0.361], t(8261) = 41.64, < 110-323), perspective shifts (𝛽 = 0.213, 95% CI = [0.197, 0.230], t(8261) = 25.55, < 110-137), and reconciliation (𝛽 = 0.191, 95% CI = [0.176, 0.207], t(8261) = 24.31, < 110-125) compared to DeepSeek-V3. QwQ-32B displays similar pattern relative to Qwen-2.5-32BIT, with greater questionanswering (𝛽 = 0.459, 95% CI = [0.444, 0.475], t(8261) = 57.57, < 110-323), perspective shifts (𝛽 = 0.378, 95% CI = [0.362, 0.394], t(8261) = 46.92, < 110-323), conflicts of perspectives (𝛽 = 0.293, 95% CI = [0.277, 0.308], t(8261) = 37.08, < 110-277), and reconciliation (𝛽 = 0.344, 95% CI = [0.328, 0.360], t(8261) = 42.59, < 110-323). Notably, all instruction-tuned models show consistently low prevalence of conversational behaviours regardless of parameter count (8B, 32B, 70B, 671B). As shown in Fig. 1b, both DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit more reciprocal socio-emotional roles compared to their instruction-tuned counterparts: they both ask for and give orientations, opinions, and suggestions, while also displaying both negative and positive roles. DeepSeek-R1 asks more frequently than DeepSeek-V3 (𝛽 = 0.189, 95% CI = [0.176, 0.203], t(8261) = 27.47, < 110-158), engages more in negative roles (𝛽 = 0.162, 95% CI = [0.147, 0.176], t(8261) = 21.87, < 110-10), and displays more positive roles (𝛽 = 0.278, 95% CI = [0.263, 0.293], t(8261) = 35.38, < 110-254). QwQ-32B shows similar pattern relative to Qwen-2.5-32B-IT, with increased asking (𝛽 = 0.200, 95% CI = [0.186, 0.215], t(8261) = 27.21, < 110-155), negative roles (𝛽 = 0.450, 95% CI = [0.436, 0.463], t(8261) = 64.77, < 110-323), and positive roles (𝛽 = 0.312, 95% CI = [0.296, 0.327], t(8261) = 39.17, < 110-307). In contrast, instruction-tuned models predominantly give orientations, opinions, and suggestions without reciprocal asking behaviours or emotional engagement, producing one-sided monologues rather than simulated dialogue. We quantify reciprocal role balance using the Jaccard index, which captures whether both sides of role pairasking versus giving for task-oriented roles, and positive versus negative for emotional roles co-occur within the same reasoning trace. As shown in Fig. 1c, DeepSeek-R1 exhibits significantly higher Jaccard indices for both ask & give (𝛽 = 0.222, 95% CI = [0.208, 0.237], t(8261) = 30.21, < 110-189) and positive & negative roles (𝛽 = 0.189, 95% CI = [0.176, 0.203], t(8261) = 27.47, < 110-158) compared to DeepSeek-V3, indicating that the model coordinates roles reciprocally rather than deploying them in isolation. QwQ-32B shows similar pattern relative to Qwen-2.5-32B-IT (ask & give: 𝛽 = 0.284 [0.269, 0.299], t(8261) = 37.36, < 110-281; positive & negative: 𝛽 = 0.200 [0.186, 0.215], t(8261) = 27.24, < 110-155) (see Supplementary Table 1). We further examine whether conversational behaviours and socio-emotional roles become more pronounced when DeepSeek-R1 faces more difficult tasks. Problem complexity is assessed both by an external LLM-as-judge (Fig. 1d: Gemini-2.5-Pro) or by error rates across conventional instruction-tuned models (Fig. 1e: DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-2.5-32B, Llama-3.3-70B-IT, Llama-3.1-8B-IT). As illustrated in Fig. 1d and 1e, these behaviours appear more frequently when DeepSeek-R1 tackles more complex problems, except for giving orientations and opinions. Consistent patterns across both measures suggest that conversational reasoning is preferentially activated in response to greater problem difficulty. For instance, tasks with the highest complexity scoressuch as GPQA (graduate-level science) and challenging math problemsexhibit strong conversational patterns, whereas simple procedural tasks like boolean expressions and basic logical deduction show minimal dialogic behaviour (see Supplementary Table 2). To decompose the accuracy advantage of reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B) using the behavioural mechanisms above, we estimate structural equation model with four conversational behaviours, four socio-emotional roles, and four cognitive behaviour mediators, using task accuracy 6 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought as the outcome. Results suggest that conversational behaviours and socio-emotional roles mediate reasoning models accuracy advantage, both directly and indirectly through facilitating useful cognitive strategies, such as verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward tracking (See Extended Data Fig. 4; Supplementary Methods: behavioural Pathways Linking Reasoning Models to Accuracy Advantages). Conversational Feature Steering Improves Reasoning Accuracy Having observed that conversational behaviours are prevalent in reasoning traces using LLM-asjudge, we next question whether steering behaviours associated with conversations contribute to reasoning performance. We employ mechanistic interpretability methods to identify and manipulate features in the models activation space related to conversational behaviours, and examine how steering these features affects the models reasoning capabilities. We use sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which decompose neural network activations into large set of linear, interpretable features 5658. Specifically, we use an SAE trained on Layer 15s residual stream activations of DeepSeek-R1-Llama8B (15-llamascope-slimpj-res-32k), distilled model derived from DeepSeek-R1 frequently used to conduct interpretability research on LLM reasoning 3841. SAEs trained on middle layers, including Layer 15, are known to capture key behavioural and semantic features in models 6,58. The SAE was trained on the SlimPajama dataset, general-purpose, large-scale corpus used to train LLMs from scratch, containing both conversational and non-conversational texts (see Supplementary Table 3 for full SAE hyperparameters) 59. To identify SAE features associated with conversational contexts, we follow conventional interpretability pipeline 56,60,61. We first run the SAE on large-scale corpus (SlimPajama-3B), sampling around 50 contexts where each of the 32,768 features activates to explain the role of each feature. These sampled contexts are then used to characterize the feature as in prior literature 56,60,61. Using LLM-as-judge classification of these contexts (Gemini-2.5-flash-lite), we compute the conversation ratio for each featurethe proportion of feature activations that occur in interpersonal, conversational settings (see Fig. 2a for the distribution across all features). For example, if the conversation ratio is 50%, then in 50% of the instances when the feature is activated, it is used for conversation. We focus on features with conversation ratios above 50% that tend to activate near sentence onsets (i.e., within the first four tokens). From the candidates, we curate feature 30939, summarized as discourse marker for surprise, realization, or acknowledgment by Gemini-2.5-Pro, which activates on tokens like Oh! in contexts involving turn-taking and social exchange (see Fig. 2a). This feature exhibits conversation ratio of 65.7%placing it in the 99th percentile among all featureswhile maintaining high sparsity (0.016% of tokens), indicating that it captures specific conversational phenomenon rather than general linguistic patterns. We select this feature because prior literature suggests that expressions of surprise signal shift in contrasting perspectives characteristic of social coordination and affiliation 62,63. We examine whether steering this feature causally induces conversational behaviours and improves reasoning accuracy using the activation addition method, which adds scaled feature vectors to model activations during generation. Specifically, we use the Countdown game, benchmark commonly used to evaluate LLM multi-step reasoning capabilities 8,52. In the Countdown task, the model must combine given set of numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+, , , ) and parentheses to reach target valuefor example, given inputs 25, 30, 3, 4 and target 32, valid solution is (30 25 + 3) 4 = 32 8,52. We use the sample of 1,024 Countdown problems. We prompt the model to generate chain-of-thought reasoning, and at each token generation step, we add the feature 30939 vector (scaled by the steering strength) to layer 15 activations. As shown in Fig. 2b, steering the conversational surprise feature with positive direction (+10) doubles 7 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought Fig. 2. Steering conversational features improves reasoning. a, Illustration of sparse autoencoder feature 30939 in DeepSeek-R1-Llama-8B, summarized as discourse marker for surprise, realization, or acknowledgment in conversational settings. Conversation ratio indicates the proportion of conversational contexts among all contexts in which this feature is activated. Percentile indicates where this features conversation ratio ranks among all features (𝑁 = 32,768). Sparsity refers to the fraction of tokens on which this feature activates across the entire corpus. Activation strength shows the magnitude of activation in the top-activating examples. The examples illustrate this features activation within conversational turn-taking contexts. b, Results of steering experiment using the activation-addition method. Adding the feature 30939 vector with strength of 10 doubles accuracy on complex counting task. The inset shows the causal change in conversational behaviours induced by steering this feature. c, Violin plots showing accuracy improvements from steering feature 30939, compared with randomly selected conversational SAE feature and randomly selected non-conversational SAE feature. d, Cognitive behavioursincluding verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chainingare causally associated with steering the activation of feature 30939. e, Structural equation model results showing that steering feature 30939 from 0 to +10 has both direct effect on reasoning accuracy and significant indirect effect mediated through cognitive behaviours (verification, subgoal setting, and backward chaining). Bold coefficients indicate statistical significance (p < 0.05). ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. 8 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought accuracy from 27.1% to 54.8% in the Countdown task, while steering in the negative direction (10) reduces accuracy to 23.8%. The radar plot inset reveals that positive steering (from 0 to +10) simultaneously increases all four conversational behavioursmore question-answering (𝛽 = 2.199, 95% CI = [1.648, 2.750], t(1023) = 7.83, < 110-14), perspective shifts (𝛽 = 1.160, 95% CI = [0.665, 1.655], t(1023) = 4.60, < 110-5), conflict of perspectives (𝛽 = 1.062, 95% CI = [0.376, 1.749], t(1023) = 3.04, = 0.002), and reconciliation (𝛽 = 0.423, 95% CI = [0.349, 0.497], t(1023) = 11.21, < 110-27), controlling for problem fixed-effects and log-transformed reasoning trace length. Negative steering from 0 to -10 suppresses them, reducing question-answering (𝛽 = 0.831, 95% CI = [1.154, 0.508], t(1023) = 5.05, < 110-6), perspective shifts (𝛽 = 0.966, 95% CI = [1.262, 0.670], t(1023) = 6.41, < 110-9), conflict of perspectives (𝛽 = 1.347, 95% CI = [1.748, 0.946], t(1023) = 6.60, < 110-10), and reconciliation (𝛽 = 0.052, 95% CI = [0.103, 0.001], t(1023) = 1.99, = 0.046). For instance, as shown in Extended Data Table 1, positive steering (+10) induces reasoning traces where the model actively challenges prior approaches (Wait, let me see. . . Another idea. . . ), showing perspective shift and conflicts of perspectives, whereas negative steering (10) produces relatively flat, declarative reasoning without internal debate. To examine whether this effect is specific to conversational features rather than general property of SAE steering, we compare accuracy improvements across three conditions: (1) steering the conversational surprise feature (Feature 30939), steering randomly selected conversational feature, and steering randomly selected non-conversational feature (Fig. 2c). random conversational feature is defined as any feature whose conversation ratio is above the average and tends to activate near sentence onset (i.e., first four tokens), which are more closely associated with conversational styles than other features. All steering strengths are defined as the maximum activation strength across sampled instances of feature activations (SlimPajama-3B), multiplied by 2. The conversational surprise feature produces substantially larger accuracy gains than both random conversational features and non-conversational features (see Fig. 2c). Steering any random conversational feature also significantly improves reasoning by 4.17% more than any random non-reasoning feature (𝛽 = 0.042, 95% CI = [0.016, 0.068], t(1023)=3.14, p=0.002). This specificity suggests that conversational dynamics, rather than arbitrary perturbations to model activations, drive the observed improvements. We further investigate the mechanism by which conversational steering enhances reasoning. Prior work has identified cognitive behavioursverification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining as key contributors to reasoning accuracy in language models 8. As shown in Fig. 2d, steering feature 30939 toward positive values (0 to +10) systematically increases all four cognitive behaviours: verification (Difference = 5.815, 95% CI=[4.922, 6.709], t(1023)=12.77, < 110-34), backtracking (Difference = 0.881, 95% CI=[0.515, 1.248], t(1023)=4.72, < 110-5), subgoal setting (Difference = 0.621, 95% CI=[0.440, 0.803], t(1023)=6.72, < 110-10), and backward chaining (Difference = 0.809, 95% CI=[0.633, 0.985], t(1023)=9.02, < 110-18) rise monotonically with steering strength. Steering toward negative values (0 to -10) suppresses these behaviours (verification: Difference = -2.302, 95% CI=[-2.892, -1.711], t(1023)=7.65, < 110-13; backtracking: Difference = -1.138, 95% CI=[-1.410, -0.867], t(1023)=8.24, < 110-15; subgoal setting: Difference = -0.171, 95% CI=[-0.305, -0.036], t(1023)=2.48, = 0.013; backward chaining: Difference = -0.353, 95% CI=[-0.487, -0.219], t(1023)=5.18, < 110-6) based on paired t-tests. This suggests that conversational features may improve reasoning, in part, by facilitating the deployment of effective cognitive strategies. To disentangle direct and indirect effects, we fit structural equation model to examine the pathways from steering conversational surprise (feature 30939) to accuracy (Fig. 2e). The model indicates that increasing steering feature 30939 from 0 to +10 yields both significant direct effect on reasoning accuracy (𝛽 = .228, 95% CI = [.183, .273], z=9.98, < 110-22, N=2048) and significant indirect 9 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought effect mediated by cognitive behaviours (𝛽 = .066, 95% CI = [.046, .086], z=6.38, < 110-10, N=2048). Collectively, these findings suggest that conversational features enhance reasoning by directly enabling more effective exploration of the solution space, but also by scaffolding the cognitive strategies that support systematic problem solving. Diversity of Implicit Perspectives Beyond task accuracy, we examine whether DeepSeek-R1 increases the diversity of perspectives expressed within reasoning trace. In human societies, conversations and socio-emotional role-taking expand the range of viewpoints and domain knowledge brought into problem solving. Differences of perspective give rise to conflict, debate, and resolution. We evaluate whether similar perspective diversity emerges in DeepSeek-R1 by analyzing personality and expertise variation among the distinct reasoning perspectives participating in each reasoning trace. We first use an external LLM-as-judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro), prompting it to identify the diversity of implicit conversational perspectives within reasoning traces of DeepSeek-R1, QwQ-32B, and other instruction-tuned models. Specifically, the model infers the number of perspectives underlying each reasoning trace, the personality traits and domain expertise associated with each perspective, and segmentation of the full reasoning trace by perspective (see Methods: Implicit Perspectives). Given complete reasoning trace, the LLM-as-judge first infers the number of distinct perspectives present, which is shown in Fig. 1d. It then characterizes each perspectives personality traits using the BFI-10 (10-Item Big Five Personality Scale) questionnaire 64, along with short free-form description of the perspectives domain expertise. Finally, the LLM-as-judge attributes each token in the reasoning trace to specific perspective (i.e., who said this word). Personality diversity is estimated using the standard deviation of inferred personality traits for each Big-5 dimension, while domain expertise diversity is estimated using the mean cosine distance between embedding of each domain expertise description and the average embedding. See Methods: Implicit Perspectives and Supplementary Method: LLM-as-judge prompts (Persona identification and Persona segmentation) for details. For instance, in chemistry reasoning trace requiring multi-step synthesis analysis, the LLM-as-judge identifies five perspectives, including critical verifier (low agreeableness, high conscientiousness) who skeptically re-evaluates assumptions, and an expert in making associations (high openness) who recalls analogous reactions. In creative writing trace where the model rewrites the sentence flung my hatred into the burning fire, seven perspectives emerge, including creative ideator (highest Openness and Extraversion) who generates stylistic alternatives and semantic fidelity checker (low agreeableness, high neuroticism) who prevents scope creepBut that adds deep-seated which wasnt in the original. DeepSeek-V3s trace reflects only single generalist perspective combining all functions without differentiation (see Supplementary Methods: Annotation Examples). Using the Intelligence Squared Debates Corpusa dataset of human argumentative conversations (N=1,196 conversations) among two to eight participantswe first validate the accuracy of the LLM-as-judge in identifying distinct voices within conversation. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 5, we find that the LLM-as-judge can accurately predict the number of distinct individuals underlying each conversation, even when speaker labels are hidden and the dialogue is concatenated into single block of text (Spearmans 𝜌 = 0.86, 95% CI = [0.84, 0.87], = 44.7, < 110-323). We also find that the LLM-as-judge can accurately predict the number of distinct turns (Spearmans 𝜌 = 0.89, 95% CI = [0.88, 0.90], = 49.2, < 110-323) and correctly attribute each token to speaker. When there are two speakers, the accuracy is 82%; for three speakers, 76%; and for four speakers, 69%. Accuracy weighted by the predicted number of implicit perspectives underlying LLM reasoning trace is 73%. Because the Intelligence Squared Debates Corpus includes biographical information about debate participants, we further verify that expertise diversity inferred by LLM-as-judge and 10 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought embeddings predicts the actual diversity among participants ground-truth biographies (Spearmans 𝜌 = 0.55, 95% CI = [0.51, 0.59], = 21.4, < 110-97). Together, these results suggest that LLM-as-judge can capture meaningful diversity patterns in conversational agents that correspond to observed diversity in real human conversations (see Methods: Implicit Perspectives - Validation for details). As shown in Fig. 3a, we find that DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B produce significantly higher personality diversity, controlling for the number of perspectives. DeepSeek-R1 shows particularly higher diversity along extraversion (𝛽 = 0.103, 95% CI = [0.075, 0.131], = 7.16, < 110-13), agreeableness (𝛽 = 0.297, 95% CI = [0.271, 0.323], = 22.65, < 110-113), neuroticism (𝛽 = 0.567, 95% CI = [0.542, 0.592], = 44.57, < 110-323), and openness (𝛽 = 0.110, 95% CI = [0.083, 0.137], = 8.06, < 110-16), compared to DeepSeek-V3. Similarly, QwQ-32B shows higher diversity in extraversion (𝛽 = 0.253, 95% CI = [0.223, 0.282], = 16.78, < 110-63), agreeableness (𝛽 = 0.490, 95% CI = [0.462, 0.519], = 34.09, < 110-254), neuroticism (𝛽 = 0.825, 95% CI = [0.797, 0.852], = 58.49, < 110-323), and openness (𝛽 = 0.268, 95% CI = [0.238, 0.298], = 17.41, < 110-68), than Qwen-2.5-32B-IT. In contrast, conscientiousness diversity is lower in DeepSeek-R1 (𝛽 = 0.291, 95% CI = [0.317, 0.265], = 21.90, < 110-106) and QwQ32B (𝛽 = 0.402, 95% CI = [0.435, 0.369], = 23.79, < 110-125), suggesting that the reasoning model voices appear more consistently engaged and dutiful. The particularly large effects for agreeableness and neuroticismtraits associated with interpersonal harmony and emotional reactivitysuggest that reasoning models generate perspectives that more frequently disagree with and challenge one another. Interestingly, this pattern aligns with prior literature on human team diversity, which suggests that variability in extraversion and neuroticism enhances team performance, whereas variability in conscientiousness impairs it 21,65. We next examine expertise diversity, defined as the dispersion of conversing agents within the embedding space of inferred domain expertise descriptions. For example, when perspectives drawing on what the models judge as expertise in theoretical physics, analytic reasoning, finance, and creative writing co-occur in the same reasoning trace, the mean distance between their expertise embeddings manifests as large (Fig. 3b). As shown in Fig. 3c, DeepSeek-R1 exhibits significantly higher expertise diversity (𝛽 = 0.179, 95% CI = [0.161, 0.196], = 20.11, < 110-89) than DeepSeek-V3, and QwQ-32B shows higher expertise diversity (𝛽 = 0.250, 95% CI = [0.231, 0.269], = 25.50, < 110-142) than Qwen-2.5-32B-IT, across its implicit reasoning agents than non-reasoning models. To examine whether the personalityand expertise-related diversity observed in DeepSeek-R1s and QwQ-32Bs reasoning traces is reflected in the internal representation space of LLMs, we analyze activations of DeepSeek-R1-Llama-8Bs sparse autoencoder (SAE) features. Prior work has shown that high-level persona traits, such as personalities, cultural perspectives, and topics, are linearly represented in LLM activation space and can be steered 6,66,67. We steer conversational feature (i.e., Feature 30939; discourse marker for surprise, realization, or acknowledgment) with strength of +10 or 10 inside the activation space of DeepSeek-R1-Llama-8B, and probe how personalityand expertise-related features are activated in the steered reasoning traces (see Methods: SAE feature steering). We first classify each of the 32,768 features as personality-related (e.g., eagerness, expressions of frustration), expertise-related (e.g., programming terminology, financial concepts), or other using an LLM-as-judge approach. We quantify diversity using two complementary measures: coverage, the number of unique personalityor expertise-related features activated across the reasoning trace, and entropy, which captures how evenly activations are distributed across tokens rather than concentrated in few. Using DeepSeek-R1 reasoning traces, we show that these traces indeed activate more diverse personality-related and expertise-related features, which corroborates our earlier LLM-as-judge results 11 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought Fig. 3. Personality and expertise diversity in reasoning traces. a, Personality diversity of implicit reasoning perspectives inferred from each reasoning trace using an LLM-as-judge and the BFI-10 (10-Item Big Five Personality Inventory). For each Big Five dimension, diversity is quantified as the standard deviation across inferred personalities. Reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B) exhibit markedly higher diversity in openness, neuroticism, agreeableness, and extraversion. Kernel density estimation (KDE) plots show the distribution of personality traits across reasoning traces. b, Embedding space of expertise identified by the LLM-as-judge, projected into two dimensions using UMAP and rendered with an energy-minimization layout, revealing coherent and consistent skill proximities. c, Expertise diversity of implicit reasoning perspectives inferred from each reasoning trace, measured as the mean cosine distance between each expertise-related embedding and the centroid of all embeddings in the semantic space. Reasoning models exhibit substantially greater expertise diversity than non-reasoning models. d, Sparse autoencoder (SAE) schema and feature identification underlying the steering experiments. e, Design of the steering experiment. SAE feature 30939capturing discourse marker for surprise, realization, or acknowledgment indicative of persona and perspective shiftsis increased or decreased with steering strength of 10. Example reasoning traces illustrate that negative steering induces linear chain-of-thought trajectories, no steering yields subtle perspective shifts enabling self-checking, and positive steering induces frequent and pronounced perspective shifts that explore fundamentally different solution strategies. f, g, Distributions of coverage and entropy for SAE personality-related (f) and expertiserelated (g) features under feature 30939 steering. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals; solid horizontal lines denote medians and dashed lines indicate interquartile ranges (25th75th percentiles). 12 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought (see Extended Data Fig. 6). For statistical tests, we control for reasoning trace length and problem fixed effects to show that steering conversational surprise activates genuinely more diverse features rather than simply producing longer outputs. As shown in Fig. 3ef, steering with +10 strength causes reasoning traces to activate wider coverage of both personality-related features (𝛽 = 315.915, 95% CI = [277.320, 354.509], = 16.04, < 110-323) and expertise-related features (𝛽 = 391.312, 95% CI = [313.743, 468.880], = 9.89, < 110-323) compared to unsteered traces, controlling for reasoning trace length and problem fixed effects. For example, after steering, personality-related features such as informal expressions of confusion or frustration (Feature 21065), phrases related to social interaction and community engagement (Feature 26139), and references to emotional or sensational themes in narratives (Feature 14476) are activated more frequently (see Supplementary Table 4 and 5). To further examine that this increased diversity reflects broader distribution of activated features rather than simply generating more tokens, we measure the Shannon entropy of feature activations. Higher entropy indicates that activations are more evenly distributed across diverse features, rather than concentrated in few dominant ones. Steered traces exhibit higher entropy of both personalityrelated features (𝛽 = 0.262, 95% CI = [0.227, 0.298], = 14.48, < 110-323) and expertise-related features (𝛽 = 0.096, 95% CI = [0.075, 0.117], = 9.02, < 110-323) than unsteered traces, confirming that steering induces more diverse feature activations beyond merely increasing output length. Reinforcement Learning Experiments To further examine whether LLMs self-reinforce conversational behaviours when rewarded for correct answers, we implement self-taught reinforcement learning (RL) experiment. In this setup, the model explores solution strategies for the Countdown arithmetic puzzle game 8,52, where the model must combine given set of numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+, , , ) and parentheses to reach target. We also replicate these findings on political misinformation detection, where models discriminate between true and fabricated political headlines. Following the reward architecture of DeepSeek-R1 4, we reward accuracy and correct format (i.e., wrapping reasoning between <think> and </think> tags and answers between <answer> and </answer> tags) with simple weighted reward: accuracy 0.9 + format 0.1. Crucially, we do not directly reward conversational or cognitive behaviours. We implement Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) 68 using the Verl framework 69, training for 250 steps (see Supplementary Table 6 for hyperparameters). We use Qwen-2.5-3B, pre-trained model without any instruction-tuning, prompted to solve the Countdown task with chain of thought (see Methods: Reinforcement learning experiments). We first examine whether conversational behaviours spontaneously increase despite not being directly rewarded. Fig. 4a presents the results, showing that accuracy improves substantially over training, rising from near zero at baseline to approximately 58% by step 250. Fig. 4b reveals that the frequency of conversational behavioursparticularly Question & Answering and Conflict of Perspectives rise throughout training despite receiving no direct reward. Perspective shifts also increase until approximately step 160, although they start to decrease as the model becomes able to reach answers with fewer shifts across the training phase. Fig. 4c-d illustrate this qualitative shift: at step 40, the model produces mechanical, enumerative chain-of-thought-style reasoning, whereas by step 120, two distinctive simulated personas have appeared, recognizing their collectivity with the pronoun we expressing uncertainty (Again no luck), considering alternatives (Maybe we can try using negative numbers), and reflecting on problem constraints. As shown in Fig. 4e, these behaviours occur while 13 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought the model employs two distinct personas according to LLM-as-judge evaluation: methodical problemsolver high in Conscientiousness and low in Openness, and an exploratory trial-and-error thinker high in Openness and Extraversion, with metacognitive reflection on solvabilitymarked by Neuroticism mediating between the two. Similar to our earlier findings based on sparse autoencoders, the increase of these behaviours has co-occurred with the increase of other cognitive behaviours, such as verification and backtracking (Extended Data Fig. 7). To corroborate the role of conversational behaviours in reasoning improvement, we compare RL training under three conditions: (1) Baseline (RL only, no priming), (2) Conversation fine-tuning (supervised fine-tuning on multi-agent dialogue text before RL), and (3) Monologue fine-tuning (fine-tuning on monologue-like, step-by-step reasoning traces before RL). To generate conversational fine-tuning data, we prompt Qwen-2.5-32B-IT to produce multi-agent-like dialogues with two, three, or four distinct personas solving 8,262 reasoning tasks (see Methods: Data), and sample 600 instances that reach correct answers (500 for training, 100 for validation). In these dialogues, the model first defines distinct personas with different personality traits and expertise (e.g., <persona1> meticulous mathematician with strong background in number theory </persona1>, <persona2> quickwitted and intuitive problem solver... not afraid to challenge assumptions </persona2>). These personas then engage in turn-taking dialogue where they build on, question, and correct each others reasoning (e.g., <think1> We can discard (2, 7) because... they are not coprime. </think1> <think2> Wait second. We cant discard (2, 7) just yet... they are indeed coprime because their greatest common divisor is 1. </think2> <think1> Youre right. overlooked that. </think1>), before converging on final answer in <group_solution> . . . </group_solution>. For monologue fine-tuning data, we generate standard chain-of-thought traces for the same problems with correct answers, where single voice reasons within <think> . . . </think> tags (e.g., <think> Since the GCD of and is 8, we can express and as 8a and 8b respectively, where and are coprime... The pairs of factors of 14 are (1, 14) and (2, 7). </think>). Supplementary Table 7 presents full examples for both types of fine-tuning data. We then fine-tune Qwen-2.5-3B on these datasets using standard next-token prediction loss wherein the models learn to reproduce the full output sequence (persona definitions, turn-by-turn reasoning or monologue trace, and final answer) given only the problem as input. This priming phase familiarizes the model with conversational versus monologue formats before RL optimizes for task accuracy (see Supplementary Table 8 for SFT hyperparameters). Extended Data Fig. 8 shows that models fine-tuned on conversational data achieve faster accuracy gains than monologue-fine-tuned models, particularly in the early stages of training. At step 40, conversation-fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-3B models reach approximately 38% accuracy while monologuefine-tuned models remain at 28%. This pattern replicates across architectures: in Llama-3.2-3B (see Supplementary Methods: Replications on Llama-3.2-3B), the conversation-fine-tuned model reaches 11% accuracy at step 70 compared to just 5% for monologue-fine-tuned models. Interestingly, in Llama-3.2-3B, the divergence becomes more striking as training progresses. By step 150, conversationfine-tuned Llama models achieve 40% accuracy while monologue-fine-tuned models plateau around 18%, less than half the performance. Notably, both conditions are trained on identical problems and correct answers, yet conversation-fine-tuned models consistently improve faster and reach higher asymptotic accuracy. This indicates that conversational structure itself, not merely exposure to correct solutions or task-related knowledge, drives the improvement. We further test whether conversational scaffolding transfers across domains. Models fine-tuned on multi-agent dialogues for the Countdown task are evaluated on qualitatively different task: political misinformation detection, where models discriminate between true and fabricated headlines from 23,299 fact-checked claims from PolitiFact. Despite never encountering this domain during 14 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought Fig. 4. Occurrence of social behaviours in accuracy-rewarded reinforcement learning and the effect of fine-tuning with conversational scaffolding. a, Comparison of the accuracy trajectory of reinforcement learning rewarded with problem-solving accuracy for the baseline Qwen-2.5-3B model and the same model initially fine-tuned to simulate social interaction through multi-agent dialogue generated by Qwen-2.5-32B. The socially initialized model reaches maximum accuracy more rapidly, whereas the baseline model eventually catches up and does so by adopting conversational behaviours, including questioning and answering, perspective shifts, and perspective conflict. b, Trajectories of individual conversational behaviours within the reinforcementlearned baseline model from panel a. Question-and-answer behaviour emerges first, followed by perspective shifts and conflicts, which rise in close synchrony. Reconciliation behaviour shows little increase, suggesting that individual approaches compete rather than forming an effective ensemble. Lines are smoothed using an exponential moving average (span = 9), and shaded regions indicate 95% confidence intervals. cd, Comparison of the Qwen-2.5 baseline model at training step 40 versus step 120. At step 40, the model primarily engages in linear chain-of-thought reasoning, whereas by step 120, two distinctive simulated personas have emerged that explicitly recognize their collectivity through the use of the pronoun we. e, Personality profiles inferred by the LLM-as-judge. The step-40 model exhibits strong all-around problem-solving profile, characterized by high conscientiousness, moderately high openness and agreeableness, lower extraversion, and notably low neuroticism. In contrast, the two collaborative agents observed at step 120 display differentiated personality profiles: one emphasizes trial-and-error problem solving, while the other specializes in metacognitive reasoning about problem solvability across alternative approaches. The trial-and-error agent is less extraverted and more agreeable than the step-40 agent, whereas the solvability-focused agent is more open and substantially less conscientious. 15 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought fine-tuning, conversation-primed models achieve faster accuracy gains than baseline models (see Supplementary Methods: Cross-domain reasoning transfer and Extended Data Fig. 9). Together, these results suggest that conversational structure facilitates the emergence of reasoning strategies during RL."

            "content": "Our findings suggest that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 do not simply generate longer or more elaborate chains of thought. Rather, they exhibit patterns characteristic of social and conversational process generating societies of thoughtposing questions, introducing alternative perspectives, generating and resolving conflicts, and coordinating diverse socio-emotional roles. These interactional patterns rarely occur in non-reasoning models across different model sizes (671B, 70B, 32B, 8B), even when controlling for reasoning trace length, suggesting that reasoning optimization introduces an intrinsic social structure within the reasoning process itself rather than merely increasing text volume. The model appears to reason by simulating internal societies, structuring thought as an exchange among interlocutors rather than as single uninterrupted voice. The implication here is that social reasoning emerges autonomously through RL as function of its consistent ability to produce correct answers, rather than through explicit human supervision or fine-tuning. This structure does not appear to be merely stylistic. Conversational behaviours and socio-emotional roles are more frequently activated when DeepSeek-R1 faces more difficult problems, and they explain substantial portion of the accuracy advantage over non-reasoning models. Steering experiments provide evidence that conversational markers are tied to reasoning performance. When we amplify feature associated with conversational surprisea discourse marker signaling perspective shift and constrastaccuracy on multi-step reasoning tasks doubles. Structural equation modeling reveals that conversational steering is associated with accuracy through both direct effects and indirect pathways mediated by cognitive strategies previously identified as central to reasoning, including verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining. This suggests that the social structure of reasoning might not be epiphenomenal but mechanistically implicated in how the model explores solution spaces and deploys effective problem-solving strategies. We further find that this interactional organization is supported by diversity among multiple implicit voices within reasoning traces. These voices vary systematically in personality traits and domain expertise, and mechanistic interpretability analyses corroborate that models activate more diverse personalityand expertise-related features when steered toward conversational markers. This pattern suggests that findings from human team researchwhere diversity in socially oriented traits such as extraversion and neuroticism enhances collective performance, whereas diversity in task-oriented traits such as conscientiousness can impair coordination and efficiency 21,65may offer useful lens for interpreting language models collective reasoning behaviours. Most R1 reasoning personas were surprisingly disciplined and hard-working! Reinforcement learning (RL) experiments further support the functional role of conversational structure. Models fine-tuned on multi-agent dialogues learn to reason more effectively than models finetuned only on correct, monologue-like reasoning traces. The benefit therefore lies not in the correctness of initial reasoning but in the procedural scaffolding provided by conversational organization. Although these experiments used relatively small 3B-parameter models (Qwen-2.5-3B and Llama-3.2-3B) on simple arithmetic tasks and misinformation detection tasks, the results suggest that even minimal social structuring within reasoning traces can accelerate the emergence of generalizable reasoning behaviour. Collectively, these findings suggest the benefits of studying social scaling in reasoning-optimized Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought models. As their test-time computations expand, reasoning traces evolve from isolated monologues into structured dialogues among differentiated internal perspectives. High-performing reasoning thus seems to depend on how attention, role-taking, and conflict resolution are coordinated within emergent societies of thought. Our goal is not to take sides on whether reasoning model traces should be regarded as discourse among simulated human groups or computational minds simulation of such discourse. Indeed, as we note above, even this distinction becomes fundamentally unclear as some theories of cognition posit how mature individual minds develop from simulations of multiagent interaction. Nevertheless, alignments between our findings on successful reasoning models and prior literature on successful human teams (e.g., diverse personality traits lead to successful collaborations) suggest that principles governing effective group collaboration may offer valuable insights for interpreting and engineering reasoning behaviours in language models. This perspective extends long-standing research on human team collaboration, where group composition and diversity are known to shape collective intelligence through variations in personality and expertise 11,1621 . Analogous dynamics within AI systems remain largely unexplored. Early investigations of humanAI collaboration 70 have begun to characterize this emerging domain, but how diversity and coordination operate within the reasoning traces of large language models remains an open question. DeepSeekR1s and QwQs internal reasoning patterns suggest that such models may already self-organize productive heterogeneity of perspectives, implying that diversity could be as fundamental to artificial reasoning as it is to human collaboration and collective dominance. growing trend in AI involves agentic architectures that deploy multiple agents engaged in more complex configurations than single-channel debate, including hierarchy, complex networks and even entire institutions of interacting agents 34,4246,71,72. Our work suggests the importance of exploring alternative structures, but also inhabiting them with diverse perspectives, personalities, and specialized expertise that drive complementarity and collective success in the human social world. Understanding how diversity and social scaffolding interact could shift how we conceptualize large language models, from solitary problem-solving entities toward collective reasoning architectures, where intelligence arises not merely from scale but the structured interplay of distinct voices. 17 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought"

We set the temperature to 0.6, temperature recommended for standard reasoning tasks 4. Measurements Conversational Behaviours We identify four conversational behaviours in reasoning traces using an LLM-as-judge approach with Gemini-2.5-Pro. (1) Questionanswering is defined as sequences where question is posed and later answered, as in conversations (e.g., Why...? Because..., What if...? Then. . . , How do we know? Well. . . , and Lets try X...? This gives us Y). (2) Perspective shift is defined as transition to different idea, viewpoint, assumption, or approach, as in conversations. (3) Conflict of perspectives is defined as expressions of disagreement, correction, or tension with another perspective (e.g., Wait, that cant be right. . . , No, actually. . . , and This contradicts. . . ). (4) Reconciliation is defined as instances where conflicting views are integrated or resolved into coherent synthesis (e.g., So perhaps both are true if. . . , Combining these insights. . . , and This resolves the tension. . . . For each reasoning trace, the LLM-as-judge counts the number of distinct instances of each behaviour, returning integer counts (0 if none are present). The full prompt is provided in Supplementary Methods: LLM-as-judge prompts. See Supplementary Table 10 for the descriptive statistics of conversational behaviors for reasoning and instruction-tuned models. For the four conversational categories, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5.2 demonstrated substantial agreement: Question-and-Answering (ICC(3,1) = .856), Perspective Shift (ICC(3,1) = .849), Conflict of Perspectives (ICC(3,1) = .912), and Reconciliation (ICC(3,1) = .804), with mean ICC of .855. Gemini-2.5-Pro also showed agreement with human ratings across the four conversational categories: Question-and-Answering (ICC(3,1) = .634), Perspective Shift (ICC(3,1) = .737), Conflict of Perspectives (ICC(3,1) = .864), and Reconciliation (ICC(3,1) = .664). Socio-Emotional Roles We analyze the presence of socio-emotional roles within reasoning traces using Bales Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) framework 55. The IPA classifies utterances into 12 interaction roles, each operationally defined in the prompt with specific behavioural descriptions. The 18 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought LLM-as-judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) counts the number of distinct instances of each of the 12 categories separately, and we aggregate these counts into four higher-level categories for our main analyses: Information-giving roles: Gives suggestion (gives direction, implying autonomy; e.g., should..., need to..., let us...) Gives opinion (gives evaluation, analysis, expresses feeling or wish) Gives orientation (provides objective or verifiable information, repeats, clarifies, confirms) Information-asking roles: Asks for suggestion (requests possible ways of action or direction) Asks for opinion (requests evaluation, analysis, or expression of feeling) Asks for orientation (requests information, repetition, or confirmation) Positive emotional roles: Shows solidarity (raises others status, gives help, reward) Shows tension release (jokes, laughs, shows satisfaction) Agrees (shows passive acceptance, understands, concurs, complies) Negative emotional roles: Shows antagonism (deflates others status, defends or asserts self) Shows tension (expresses uncertainty, asks for help, withdraws from the field) Disagrees (shows passive rejection, formality, or withholds help) Inter-rater reliability is substantial for the four higher-level IPA categories used in our main analyses: Ask (Gemini-2.5-Pro vs. GPT-5.2: ICC(3,1) = .939; Gemini-2.5-Pro vs. Human: ICC(3,1) = .836), Give (ICC(3,1) = .864; ICC(3,1) = .666), Positive (ICC(3,1) = .939; ICC(3,1) = .870), and Negative (ICC(3,1) = .838; ICC(3,1) = .779). See Supplementary Table 10 for the descriptive statistics of socio-emotional roles for reasoning and instruction-tuned models. To measure whether socio-emotional roles co-occur reciprocally within reasoning traces, we compute the Jaccard index for two role pairs: (1) asking versus giving for task-oriented roles, and (2) positive versus negative for emotional roles. The Jaccard index is defined as the number of reasoning traces containing both roles in pair divided by the number of reasoning traces containing either role, capturing whether models coordinate complementary roles within the same trace rather than deploying them in isolation. Higher Jaccard indices indicate more balanced, dialogue-like interaction patterns, whereas lower indices suggest one-sided, monologic reasoning. Cognitive Behaviours We identify four cognitive behaviours previously established as contributors to reasoning accuracy in language models using Gemini-2.5-Pro as LLM-as-judge 4,8,3537. For the measurement, we adopt the prompt and examples used by Gandhi and colleagues (2025) 8, which has been verified by multiple human raters. Each behaviour is operationally defined in the prompt with specific examples to guide annotation: Verification is defined as instances where the chain-ofreasoning explicitly checks the current result against the target solution. The prompt provides specific examples: This sequence results in 1, which is not equal to 22 and Since 25 is not equal to 22. Backtracking is defined as instances where the model realizes path wont work and explicitly goes back to try different approach. Subgoal setting is defined as instances where the model breaks down the problem into smaller, intermediate goals. Backward chaining is defined as instances where the model starts from the target solution and works backwards to the initial problems. 19 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought For the four cognitive reasoning behaviors, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5.2 demonstrate good to excellent agreement: Answer Verification (ICC(3,1) = .995), Backtracking (ICC(3,1) = .829), Subgoal Setting (ICC(3,1) = .810), and Backward-Chaining (ICC(3,1) = .756), with mean ICC of .848. Gemini-2.5Pro also shows substantial agreement with human rater across the four cognitive behaviors: Answer Verification (ICC(3,1) = .981), Backtracking (ICC(3,1) = .921), Subgoal Setting (ICC(3,1) = .559), and Backward-Chaining (ICC(3,1) = .578), with mean ICC of .760. These reliability estimates are computed on 30 reasoning traces to solve general-purpose reasoning problems (see Methods: Data) and 50 reasoning traces generated during reinforcement learning of Qwen-2.5-3B (see Methods: Reinforcement Learning Experiments). Problem Complexity We measure problem complexity using two complementary approaches. First, we use LLM-as-judge ratings. Gemini-2.5-Pro rates each problem on 7-point Likert scale. The prompt instructs the model to rate the intrinsic difficulty of the problem for capable language model under zero-shot conditions using the following scale: 1 = very easy, 2 = easy, 3 = somewhat easy, 4 = moderate, 5 = somewhat difficult, 6 = difficult, 7 = very difficult. The full prompt is provided in Supplementary Methods: LLM-as-judge prompts. Second, we use empirical error rates. We compute the number of incorrect answers across four instruction-tuned models (DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-2.5-32B-IT, Llama-3.3-70B-IT, Llama-3.1-8B-IT), yielding score from 0 to 4 representing the number of models that failed to answer correctly. After sampling and annotating 50 reasoning problems, we find substantial inter-rater reliability between Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5.2 (ICC(3,1) = .745). Gemini-2.5-Pros complexity scores show strong correlation with non-reasoning models error rates (Spearmans 𝜌 = 0.526, 95% CI = [0.508, 0.543], = 46.26, < 110-323, = 7,738), confirming convergent validity between the two measures. Statistical Analyses To estimate whether observed differences between reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B) and instruction-tuned baselines arise from conversational behaviours or socio-emotional roles rather than from task heterogeneity or reasoning trace length, we estimate the following linear probability model for each behavioural outcome Yij, which is binary variable. 𝑌𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑚 𝑀 𝛽𝑚 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑚,𝑖 𝑗 + 𝛾𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑖 𝑗) + 𝛼 + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 𝑗 where indexes individual task problems, and indexes individual reasoning traces generated by different models. Yij equals 1 if the reasoning trace exhibits the behavior more than once. 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑚,𝑖 𝑗 is categorical dummy variable that equals 1 if reasoning trace for problem is generated by model m, and 0 otherwise, where 𝑀 = {𝐷𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑘_𝑟1, 𝐷𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑘_𝑣3, 𝑄𝑤𝑄_32𝑏, 𝑄𝑤𝑒𝑛_2.5_32𝑏_𝑖𝑡, 𝐿𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑎_3.3_70𝑏_𝑖𝑡 𝐿𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑎_3.1_8𝑏_𝑖𝑡} Either DeepSeek-V3 or Qwen-2.5-32B-IT serves as the reference category and is excluded, such that each coefficient 𝛽m represents the marginal difference in the outcome relative to DeepSeek-V3 or Qwen-2.5-32B-IT. Log(Lenij) denotes the reasoning trace length (i.e., the number of words in each reasoning trace), adjusting the extreme skewness of reasoning trace length (see Extended Data Fig. 1). 𝜇𝑖 represents task fixed effects at the individual problem level, absorbing all variation associated with each problems intrinsic difficulty, phrasing, and topical content. This ensures that comparisons between models are made within the same problem rather than across heterogeneous tasks. 𝛼 is the intercept. Robust standard errors are clustered at the task level to account for within-task correlation. Models are estimated using StataNow/SE 19.5. 20 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought SAE Feature Steering To investigate the role of conversational behaviours in reasoning, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify and manipulate interpretable features in the models activation space. SAEs decompose neural network activations into sparse set of linear features, enabling targeted intervention on specific behavioural dimensions without altering model weights 5658.We use an SAE trained on Layer 15s residual stream activations of DeepSeek-R1-Llama-8B (15-llamascope-slimpj-res-32k). The SAE has been trained on SlimPajama, general-purpose corpus containing both conversational and non-conversational texts, with dictionary size of 32,768 features (see Supplementary Table 3 for hyperparameters). To identify features associated with conversational contexts, we follow standard interpretability pipeline. For each of the 32,768 features, we sample approximately 50 contexts from the pretraining corpus where the feature activates most strongly. We then use an LLM-as-judge classifier (Gemini-2.5-flash-lite) to determine whether each activation context represents conversational setting, computing conversation ratio for each featurethe proportion of activations occurring in conversational contexts. We apply two filtering criteria: (1) conversation ratio above 50%, and (2) activation near sentence onsets 50% or more (within the first four tokens). From the candidate features, we select Feature 30939, which the LLM judge summarized as discourse marker for surprise, realization, or acknowledgment. This feature activates on tokens such as Oh! in contexts involving turn-taking and social exchange. Feature 30939 exhibits conversation ratio of 65.7% (99th percentile among all features) while maintaining high sparsity (0.016% of tokens), indicating specificity to conversational phenomena rather than general linguistic patterns. We implement activation addition to steer Feature 30939 during generation. At each token generation step, we add the features decoder vector, scaled by steering strength s, to the models Layer 15 residual stream activations. ℎ 𝑡 = ℎ𝑡 + 𝑠 𝑑30939 where ℎ𝑡 denotes the original activation at token position and d30939 denotes the decoder vector for Feature 30939. We first generate reasoning traces under seven steering conditions: 𝑠 {15, 10, 5, 0, 5, 10, 15}. As 𝑠 {15, 15} exhibits lower accuracy due to excessive steering, we use 𝑠 {10, 5, 0, 5, 10}. Reasoning Task and Evaluation We evaluate reasoning performance using the Countdown task, benchmark for multi-step arithmetic reasoning commonly used to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities. In each problem, the model must combine set of input numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+, , , ) and parentheses to reach target value. For example, given inputs {25, 30, 3, 4} and target 32, valid solution is (30 25 + 3) 4 = 32. We use 1,024 problems. We use the following prompt template: Using the numbers [79, 17, 60], create an equation that equals 36. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and each number can only be used once. Show your work in <think> </think> tags. And return the final answer in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer> (1 + 2) / 3 </answer>. Solutions are scored as correct if the final numerical answer matches the target value, evaluated using Gemini-2.5-flash-lite. After steering, we measure the frequency of conversational behaviours (questionanswering, perspective shift, conflict of perspectives, reconciliation) and cognitive behaviours (verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, backward chaining) in each generated reasoning trace using the LLM-as-judge procedures described above. To estimate behavioural differences across steering conditions, we estimate 21 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought fixed-effects linear regression models for each behavioural count variable 𝑌𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑠 { 10,5,0,5,10} 𝛽𝑠𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑠,𝑖 𝑗 + 𝛾𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑖 𝑗) + 𝛼 + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 𝑗 where indexes individual task problems, and indexes individual reasoning traces generated before or after steering. 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑖 𝑗 is categorical variable indicating steering strength. log(𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑖 𝑗) denotes the log-transformed reasoning trace length (i.e., the number of words in each reasoning trace), adjusting the extreme skewness of reasoning trace length (see Extended Data Fig. 1). 𝜇𝑖 represents task fixed effects at the individual problem level, absorbing all variation associated with each problems intrinsic difficulty. Experiment Conditions To assess whether accuracy improvements are specific to conversational features rather than general property of SAE steering, we compare three conditions: (1) Feature 30939 (conversational surprise), (2) randomly selected conversational features (conversation ratio above mean and activating near sentence onset), and (3) randomly selected non-conversational features (conversation ratio below mean). For condition (1), we evaluate all 1,024 Countdown problems. For conditions (2) and (3), we randomly sample 300 features from each category and have each feature solve 16 randomly selected problems, yielding distribution of accuracy scores across features within each condition. For all conditions, steering strength is set to twice the maximum activation strength observed for that feature across sampled instances in SlimPajama-3B. We test for differences in accuracy between conditions using linear regression with problem fixed effects. Feature Diversity To examine whether steering conversational features induces greater activation of personalityand expertise-related features in the models internal representation space, we analyze sparse autoencoder (SAE) feature activations before and after steering. We use the same SAE employed in the steering experiments: an SAE trained on Layer 15s residual stream activations of DeepSeekR1-Llama-8B with dictionary size of 32,768 features. For each reasoning trace generated under different steering conditions (s {10, 0, +10}), we record which SAE features are activated at each token position by passing the Layer 15 activations through the SAE encoder. For each of the 32,768 SAE features, Neuronpedia provides textual description generated by prompting GPT-4o-mini with the top-activating token sequences. Using Gemini-2.5-flash-lite, we classify each feature description into one of three categories: personality-related, expertise-related, or other. Gemini-2.5-flash-lite first scores each feature from 0 to 100 based on whether it is related to personality traits or domain expertise (see Supplementary Methods: LLM-as-judge prompts). Then, we use the threshold of 50 to determine whether they are personality or expertise features. Among the 32,768 features, 5,455 are labeled as personality-related (e.g., eagerness, expressions of frustration) and 15,436 as expertise-related (e.g., programming terminology, financial concepts). For each reasoning trace, we compute two complementary measures of feature diversity within each category (personality-related or expertise-related). First, coverage is defined as the number of unique features within category (personality or expertise) that exhibit non-zero activation across all tokens in reasoning trace. Second, entropy is computed over the distribution of token counts that activate each SAE feature within given category. Each reasoning trace is represented as 32,768dimensional vector, where each element corresponds to the number of tokens within the reasoning trace that activated specific SAE feature. Entropy for category (personality or expertise) was then calculated as: 22 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought 𝐻𝑐 = 𝑓 𝑐 𝑎 𝑓 log(𝑎 𝑓 ) where 𝑎 𝑓 denotes the number of activating tokens for feature 𝑓 within category 𝑐. Higher coverage indicates that the reasoning trace draws on broader range of personalityor expertise-related features. Higher entropy indicates that activations are more evenly distributed across features rather than concentrated in few dominant ones. For instance, reasoning trace with high coverage but low entropy explores diverse features but focuses primarily on small subset, whereas high coverage and high entropy suggest that reasoning draws on multiple feature types more evenly throughout the reasoning process. To examine the effect of conversational steering on feature diversity, we compare coverage and entropy across steering conditions (s {10, 0, +10}) for the same 1,024 Countdown problems. We estimate fixed-effects linear regression models with coverage or entropy as the outcome, steering strength as the predictor, and controls for log-transformed reasoning trace length and problem fixed effects. This specification isolates the effect of steering on feature diversity beyond mere changes in output length. Implicit Perspectives To quantify the diversity of reasoning perspectives within each reasoning trace, we use an LLM-asjudge protocol (Gemini-2.5-Pro) that performs three sequential tasks: (1) inferring the number of distinct perspectives present in the reasoning trace, (2) characterizing each perspectives personality traits and domain expertise, and (3) segmenting the reasoning trace by attributing each portion to specific perspective. Given complete reasoning trace, the LLM-as-judge first infers the number of distinct perspectives present. Then, for each identified perspective, the LLM-as-judge answers the 10 items of the BFI-10 (Ten-Item Big Five Inventory) 64 as if responding from that perspectives point of view. Each item (is generally trusting, tends to be lazy, is relaxed, handles stress well, has few artistic interests, is outgoing, is sociable, tends to find fault with others, does thorough job, gets nervous easily, and has an active imagination,) is rated on five-point scale from Disagree strongly to Agree strongly. Scores for each of the five personality dimensions (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Openness) are computed as the mean of the two corresponding items, with reverse-coding applied where appropriate. Additionally, the LLM-as-judge generates concise free-form description of each perspectives domain expertise (e.g., Theoretical Physicist specializing in model abstraction, Software Engineer focusing on algorithmic efficiency). Finally, the LLM-as-judge attributes each segment of the reasoning trace to one of the identified perspectives, producing mapping that indicates which perspective generated each portion of the text. The full prompts, which elicit all three outputs in single structured JSON response, are provided in Supplementary Methods: LLM-as-judge prompts. Personality Diversity To quantify personality diversity within reasoning trace, we calculate the standard deviation of the five-dimensional personality vectors across implicit voices identified within the same reasoning trace. Let vij denote the score of the i-th implicit voice on the 𝑗-th personality dimension ( 𝑗 = 1 , . . . , 5). For each dimension 𝑗, the within-trace personality diversity Pj was computed as: 23 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought 𝑃 𝑗 = (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:116) 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 (𝑣𝑖 𝑗 𝑣𝑗)2 where is the number of implicit voices and 𝑣𝑗 = (cid:205)𝑁 reasoning trace contained only single implicit voice, 𝑃 𝑗 = 0. 𝑖=1 𝑣𝑖 𝑗 is the mean score for dimension j. If Expertise Diversity Each implicit reasoning voices expertise is qualitatively profiled through concise textual description summarizing the domain expertise. Each statement was embedded using Googles EmbeddingGemma-300M model to obtain semantic vector representation ei for the i-th implicit voice (i=1, . . . , N) 73. To quantify expertise diversity within reasoning trace, we compute the mean cosine distance between each embedding and the centroid of all embeddings in the semantic space. Expertise diversity was defined as: 𝐸 = (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:116) 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 (1 𝑒𝑖 𝑒 𝑒𝑖 𝑒 ) where 𝑒𝑖 𝑒 denotes the inner product between embeddings and 𝑒 their vector norms. If reasoning trace contained only single implicit voice, 𝐸 = 0. Validation To validate the accuracy of the LLM-as-judge protocol, we use the Intelligence Squared Debates Corpusa dataset of human argumentative conversations (N = 1,196 conversations) among two to eight participants with known ground-truth speaker labels and biographical information. To ensure that the model cannot rely on superficial cues such as speaker tags or formatting, we remove all speaker labels and concatenate each dialogue into single block of text, mimicking the format of LLM reasoning traces. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 5, we find that the LLM-as-judge can accurately predict the number of distinct individuals (Spearmans 𝜌 = 0.86, 95% CI = [0.84, 0.87], = 44.7, < 110-323) and the number of distinct turns underlying each conversation (Spearmans 𝜌 = 0.89, 95% CI = [0.88, 0.90], = 49.2, < 110-323). To evaluate token-level speaker attribution accuracy, we construct ground truth by assigning each token to its true speaker based on the original transcript. We then extract the models predicted perspective segments and align them to the token stream. To match predicted perspective IDs (e.g., Perspective 1, Perspective 2) with the original speaker labels, we apply the Hungarian algorithma combinatorial optimization method that finds the one-to-one assignment between predicted IDs and true speakers that maximizes total token-level agreement. Speaker-level accuracy measures the proportion of tokens assigned to the correct speaker under this optimal mapping. When there are two speakers, accuracy is 82%; for three speakers, 76%; and for four speakers, 69%. Weighted by the distribution of predicted perspectives in LLM reasoning traces, overall accuracy is 73%. Because the Intelligence Squared Debates Corpus includes biographical information about debate participants, we further verify that expertise diversity inferred by the LLM-as-judge correlates with actual diversity among participants ground-truth biographies. We compute expertise diversity from LLM-inferred descriptions and compare it to diversity computed from true biographies, finding significant correspondence (Spearmans 𝜌 = 0.55, 95% CI = [0.51, 0.59], = 21.4, < 110-97). We further examine whether measurements based on LLM-as-judge are aligned with the measurements we get from SAE regarding personality and expertise diversity. Specifically, we feed reasoning traces Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought from DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-v3, Llama-3.3-70B-IT, and Llama-3.1-8B-IT into Llama-3.1-8B-IT and extract activations from SAE trained on its residual stream (Layer 16). We then identify personalityrelated and expertise-related features using the same LLM-as-judge prompting procedure described above. Extended Data Fig. 6 shows that DeepSeek-R1s reasoning traces activate significantly more diverse personality and expertise features than those of other models: both coverage (number of unique features activated) and entropy (distribution evenness across features) are substantially higher for DeepSeek-R1. This suggests the convergence between text-level behavioural coding and activation-level feature analysis. Reinforcement Learning Experiments Countdown Task Prompt We use the following prompt template: Using the numbers [79, 17, 60], create an equation that equals 36. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and each number can only be used once. Show your work in <think> </think> tags. And return the final answer in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer> (1 + 2) / 3 </answer>. Experimental Conditions To test whether conversational scaffolding accelerates the emergence of reasoning during reinforcement learning (RL), we compare three conditions: 1. Baseline (RL only): The base model (Qwen-2.5-3B or Llama-3.2-3B) undergoes RL training without any prior fine-tuning. The model is prompted to solve Countdown problems with chain-of-thought reasoning, wrapping its reasoning in <think>...</think> tags and its final answer in <answer>...</answer> tags. 2. Conversation fine-tuning: The base model is first supervised-fine-tuned on multi-agent dialogue data before RL training. 3. Monologue fine-tuning: The base model is first supervised-fine-tuned on single-agent chain-ofthought traces before RL training. Supervised Fine-Tuning Datasets We construct fine-tuning datasets using Qwen-2.5-32B-IT as generator. We generate 3,600 multi-agent dialogues for Countdown problems, with 1,200 dialogues each for two-agent, three-agent, and four-agent settings. From these, we sample 600 dialogues that reach correct final solutions (200 each for 2-agent, 3-agent, and 4-agent settings; 500 for training, 100 for validation). See Supplementary Methods: SFT data generation prompts. Conversation Dataset Each conversational trace begins with persona definitions specifying distinct personality traits and expertise, followed by turn-taking reasoning where personas build on, question, and correct each other, and concludes with group consensus. For example: <persona1> Extrovert mathematician focused on arithmetic heuristics. </persona1> <persona2> Analytical engineer emphasizing step efficiency. </persona2> <think1> Lets first compute 30 25 = 5 to simplify the target space. </think1> <think2> That yields 5, we can now multiply by 4 to approach 20. </think2> <think1> Good idea. 5 4 = 20, but we need 32. </think1> <think2> Wait, let me recalculate... </think2> <group_consensus> The best sequence is (30 25 + 3) 4 = 32. </group_consensus> 25 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought Monologue Dataset For the same 600 problems used in the conversation dataset, we generate standard single-agent chain-of-thought traces that reach correct answers. Each trace consists of step-by-step reasoning from single voice within <think>...</think> tags, followed by final answer. For example: <think> To reach 32 from {25, 30, 3, 4}, Ill try combining operations. 30 25 = 5. Then 5 + 3 = 8. Finally, 8 4 = 32. Let me verify: (30 25 + 3) 4 = 8 4 = 32. Correct. </think> <answer> (30 25 + 3) 4 = 32 </answer> Crucially, both datasets contain solutions to identical problems with identical correct answers, ensuring that any performance difference reflects the reasoning format rather than exposure to different solutions or task knowledge. Supervised Fine-Tuning Procedure Qwen-2.5-3B base model is supervised-fine-tuned on one of the two datasets using standard next-token prediction loss. Models learn to reproduce the full output sequenceincluding persona definitions and turn-by-turn reasoning (for conversation) or single-agent reasoning (for monologue), and final answergiven only the problem prompt as input. This priming phase familiarizes the model with conversation-like or monologue-like reasoning before RL optimizes for task accuracy. SFT hyperparameters are provided in Supplementary Table 8. See Supplementary Methods: Replications on Llama-3.2-3B for details on replicating these results in another model. Full generation prompts are provided in Supplementary Methods: Prompts. Reinforcement Learning Procedure Reinforcement learning is performed on the Countdown arithmetic puzzle, using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) with the Verl framework 68. While DeepSeek-R1 uses simplified version of PPO 68 called GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) 74, we utilize PPO for the superior stability across hyperparameters 8. Preliminary analyses showed no significant difference in learning performance between PPO and GRPO (see Supplementary Methods: Performance comparison between PPO and GRPO). Reward is assigned as: 𝑅 = 0.9 { 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐 𝑦} + 0.1 {𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡} Reasoning trace leads to the correct answer and 0 otherwise. Format is also binary, coded as 1 if the reasoning trace contains at least one reasoning block (<think> </think>) and one final answer block ( <answer> </answer>) providing single answer in equation form, and 0 otherwise. Crucially, we do not directly reward conversational or cognitive behaviours. Training proceeds for 250 steps. PPO hyperparameters are provided in Supplementary Table 6. To examine whether conversational behaviours emerge spontaneously during RL despite not being directly rewarded, we evaluate model performance on held-out validation set of 1,024 Countdown problems at each training checkpoint (every 10 steps). For each checkpoint, we generate reasoning traces for all validation problems and measure both accuracy and the frequency of conversational behaviours (questionanswering, perspective shift, conflict of perspectives, reconciliation) using the LLM-as-judge procedure described in Methods: Conversational behaviours.

First, Ill consider the sum of all four numbers: 46 + 54 + 54 + 77 = 231 Next, Ill explore subtracting specific combination to reduce the total to 75. Subtracting 77 from 231 gives: 231 - 77 = 154 Now, Ill look for way to reduce 154 further. Dividing 154 by 2 gives: 154 / 2 = 77 Since have two 54s, dividing one of them by 2 will utilize both 54s: 54 / 2 = 27 Finally, Ill combine these results to form the equation: (46 + 54) / 2 + 77 - 27 = 75 </think> <answer> (46 + 54) / 2 + 77 - 27 </answer> <think> To achieve the target number 75 using the numbers 46, 54, 52, and 77, Ill start by considering the largest number, 77, and aim to reduce it to value that can be combined with the others to reach 75. Subtracting 46 from 77 gives me 31. Next, Ill use the remaining numbers, 54 and 52. Dividing 54 by 2.5 will help balance the equation, leading to 21.6. Finally, adding 21.6 to 31 results in 52.6, which is still not 75. To refine this, Ill multiply 52 by 1.5 to get 78, and then subtract 3 from it to arrive at 75. This step-by-step approach ensures that each number is used exactly once and the operations are basic arithmetic. </think> <answer> (77 - 46) + (54 / 2.5)+( 52 * 1.5 ) - 3 </answer> Result WRONG WRONG Continued on next page 42 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought Steering Reasoning Trace +10 <think> Okay, so have this problem where need to use the numbers 46, 54, 52, and 77 to create an equation that equals 75. can use basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and each number can only be used once. Alright, lets try to figure this out step by step. First, Ill list out the numbers: 46, 54, 52, 77. need to combine them with operations to get 75. Hmm, 75 isnt too big, but these numbers are all in the 40s and 50s, so maybe can subtract something from larger number or maybe divide something to get smaller number. Let me think about the possible operations. Maybe can subtract two numbers and then add or multiply the rest. Or perhaps can divide some numbers to get fractions, but that might complicate things. Let me try some combinations. Wait, let me see what the total sum of these numbers is. 46 + 54 is 100, and 52 + 77 is 129. So the total is 100 + 129, which is 229. Hmm, thats way higher than 75. So maybe need to subtract some numbers or divide to bring it down. Another idea: Maybe can combine some numbers first. Like, 46 and 54. If subtract 46 from 54, get 8. Or if subtract 52 from 54, thats 2. Or maybe 46 and 52. If subtract 46 from 52, thats 6. Hmm, those are small numbers, but maybe can use them in way that helps me reach 75. Wait, 77 is the biggest number here. Maybe can subtract 77 from something. Lets see, 77 minus 46 is 31, 77 minus 54 is 23, 77 minus 52 is 25. Hmm, those are still not 75. But maybe can use division. For example, 77 divided by something. If divide 77 by 2, thats 38.5, but dont have 2. Alternatively, 77 divided by 3 is about 25.666, but dont have 3 either. Maybe thats not the way. Wait, another thought: Maybe can multiply some numbers. Lets see, 46 times 54 is way too big. 46 times 52 is even bigger. 54 times 52 is also too big. So multiplication might not help here. Maybe division can help. Let me try subtracting some numbers. If take 54 minus 46, thats 8. Then, 52 minus 77 is negative, which might not help. Alternatively, 77 minus 52 is 25. Maybe can use that 25 somehow. If have 25, how can get to 75? Maybe 25 times 3 is 75. But do have 3? Hmm, maybe can get 3 by doing something with the other numbers. Wait, 54 minus 46 is 8, and 52 minus 77 is -25, but maybe can flip that. Wait, 77 minus 52 is 25. So if have 25, and need to get to 75, need 3 more. How can get 3? Maybe from the other numbers. Lets see, 46, 54, 52, 77. If do 54 minus 46, thats 8, and then maybe can subtract 5 to get 3, but do have 5? dont. Alternatively, maybe can do 52 divided by something. 52 divided by 17 is 3, but dont have 17. Hmm. [... extensive exploration of many approaches ...] Wait, maybe can use all four numbers in more complex way. Like, (46 + 54) is 100, and (52 - 77) is -25. Then, 100 + (-25) is 75! Oh, wait, that works! Wait, let me check: 46 + 54 is 100, and 52 - 77 is -25. So, 100 + (-25) is 75. Yes, thats it! So the equation would be (46 + 54) + (52 - 77) = 75. Wait, but let me make sure Im not using any numbers more than once. used 46, 54, 52, and 77, each once. So thats correct. So, the equation is (46 + 54) + (52 - 77) = 75. Let me calculate it: 46 + 54 is 100, 52 - 77 is -25, and 100 + (-25) is 75. Perfect! So, thats the solution. </think> <answer> (46 + 54) + (52 - 77) </answer> Result RIGHT Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought"

The choices are 10, 8, 7, or 4. The sequence starts with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane, and hepta-2,5-diene means it has double bonds at positions 2 and 5. So its norbornadiene derivative with tert-butoxy group at position 7. Position 7 is the bridgehead carbon. Norbornadiene has two double bonds, and the tert-butoxy is attached to the carbon that bridges the two methylene groups. Then its combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That sounds like diene with dibromomethyl groups on it. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, so positions 5 and 6 are the methylene carbons, but here its bis(dibromomethyl), so its probably CHBr2 groups attached to positions 5 and 6. 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene means that at carbons 5 and 6, there are dibromomethyl substituents, so its like 1,2-di(bromomethyl)benzene or something, but its diene, not aromatic.

So 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene should have the dibromomethyl groups on the saturated carbons. In cyclohexa-1,3-diene, carbons 1,2,3,4 are involved in double bonds, so carbons 5 and 6 are the CH2 groups, but since its diene, positions 5 and 6 are equivalent and are sp3 carbons. So bis(dibromomethyl) means each has CHBr2 group instead of H, so its 1,2-di(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene? No, the carbon atoms 5 and 6 are part of the ring, so if they are bis(dibromomethyl), it might mean that the hydrogens are replaced, but typically, its specified as substituents. 45 2 4 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought Conversational Behaviour: {question_and_answering': 1, perspective_shift': 2, conflict_of_perspectives': 1, reconciliation': 1} IPA: {'1_Shows_solidarity': 0, '2_Shows_tension_release': 0, '3_Agrees': 0, '4_Gives_suggestion': 0, '5_Gives_opinion': 3, '6_Gives_orientation': 2, '7_Asks_for_orientation': 1, '8_Asks_for_opinion': 0, '9_Asks_for_suggestion': 0, '10_Disagrees': 0, '11_Shows_tension': 0, '12_Shows_antagonism': 0} Cognitive Behaviour: {verification': 0, backtracking': 1, subgoal_setting': 0, backward_chaining': 0} think 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) means that at positions 5 and 6, there are -CHBr2 groups attached, but positions 5 and 6 are ring carbons.

So with NaI, it generates o-xylylene in situ. Then, this o-xylylene can act as diene in Diels-Alder reactions. Now, the other compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene. Norbornadiene can act as dienophile because one of its double bonds can be electron-deficient or something, but with tert-butoxy, it might be electron-rich.

Norbornadiene has carbons: bridgehead 1 and 4, double bond between 2-3, double bond between 5-6, and 7 is the bridge. If 2-3 acts as dienophile, adding o-xylylene, the adduct has benzene ring fused between C2 and C3 of the norbornane, but since C2 and C3 were double-bonded, after addition, its single bond, and the new ring is aromatic or something.

The fused system: after Diels-Alder, for each addition, the o-xylylene becomes benzene ring fused, with the norbornane double bond becoming single bond in cyclohexene ring. For one addition: norbornadiene has double bond at 2-3. When it to o-xylylene, o-xylylene is the diene, so the dienophile double bond (2-3) becomes single bond, and new six-member ring is formed, fused to positions 2 and 3. Since positions 2 and 3 were part of the five-member ring in norbornane, now its fused system with benzene ring. Specifically, the adduct is benzofused norbornene, with the double bond at 5-6 still present. Then, the second o-xylylene adds to the 5-6 double bond, similarly, forming another benzene ring fused at 5-6. So the final adduct for product 1 is molecule where the norbornane skeleton has benzene rings fused to both \"sides\", and the bridge carbon 7 has tert-butoxy. Moreover, since the fusions are at the former double bond positions, the norbornane is now like central bicyclic system with two benzene rings attached via the fusion.

For example, if the dienophile is ethylene, the adduct is 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, which has double bond and can be oxidized to naphthalene.

The exact structure of **1** is unclear, but it likely forms complex polycyclic system. ### Step 2: Formation of Product 2 2. **Aqueous H2SO4 Treatment**: Hydrolysis of **1** removes the tert-butoxy group, possibly forming hydroxyl group or exposing double bond. The structure of **2** is still complex but may involve diene or alcohol functionality. ### Step 3: Formation of Product 3 3. **SO3 and Pyridine in DMSO**: This is sulfonation or oxidation step, likely introducing sulfonyl or sulfonate group. The structure of **3** may now include sulfone or sulfonic acid derivative. ### Step 4: Formation of Product 4 4. **Heating at 150C**: This step could involve elimination, rearrangement, or further cyclization. The final product (**4**) is likely highly symmetric polycyclic aromatic or conjugated system due to the high-temperature conditions. ### Symmetry and Distinct Hydrogens - The final product is likely symmetric, rigid polycyclic structure (e.g., naphthalene or anthracene derivative with substituents). - Given the symmetry and the nature of the transformations, the number of chemically distinct hydrogens is likely **8**. This is because: - Aromatic systems with symmetric substitution patterns reduce the number of distinct hydrogens. - The substituents (e.g., sulfonyl groups) may further reduce the symmetry, but 8 is reasonable estimate based on the complexity of the correct answer is **(B) 8**. 79 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought DeepSeek-V3: Creative Sentence Rewriting Rewrite the sentence: \"I flung my hatred into the burning fire.\" Put your entire response in double quotation marks.

This equals 31, not 14. 84 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought Conversational Behaviour: {question_and_answering': 0, perspective_shift': 0, conflict_of_perspectives': 0, reconciliation': 0} IPA: {'1_Shows_solidarity': 0, '2_Shows_tension_release': 0, '3_Agrees': 0, '4_Gives_suggestion': 0, '5_Gives_opinion': 2, '6_Gives_orientation': 1, '7_Asks_for_orientation': 0, '8_Asks_for_opinion': 0, '9_Asks_for_suggestion': 0, '10_Disagrees': 0, '11_Shows_tension': 1, '12_Shows_antagonism': 0} Cognitive Behaviour: {verification': 0, backtracking': 0, subgoal_setting': 0, backward_chaining': 0} Again, no luck. It seems difficult to find the correct combination of these numbers and operations that results in 14. It might be impossible with the given numbers. Therefore, the answer is: Supplementary Methods: Behavioural Pathways Linking Reasoning Models to Accuracy Advantages We estimate structural equation model (SEM) to decompose the accuracy advantage of DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B over instruction-tuned models into distinct behavioral pathways. The model includes whether the model is DeepSeek-R1 or QwQ-32B as the treatment indicator, eight social behavior mediators (question & answering, perspective shift, conflict of perspectives, reconciliation, ask, give, negative, and positive), four cognitive behavior mediators (verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining), and task accuracy as the outcome. We control for log-transformed reasoning trace length. SEM estimates three pathways. The social pathway captures whether the increased use of eight social behavior mediators in DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B improves accuracy. The cognitive pathway examines whether the increased use of cognitive reasoning strategies in DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ32B, including verification (i.e., systematically checking intermediate steps), backtracking (i.e., revising earlier steps), subgoal setting (i.e., decomposing the task into intermediate targets), and backward chaining (i.e., reasoning backward from the desired conclusion) enhance accuracy. The socialcognitive pathway investigates whether increased social behaviors facilitate these cognitive strategies, which then improve accuracy. The full system of equations estimated in the SEM is as follows. Let index individual task problems, and index individual reasoning traces generated by different models. The dependent variable is reasoning accuracy (𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖 𝑗), coded as binary variable that equals 1 if the reasoning trace leads to correct answer, and 0 otherwise. The key predictor is 𝑅𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖 𝑗 which equals 1 if the reasoning trace is generated by DeepSeek-R1 or QwQ-32B and 0 if generated by an instruction-tuned model. 𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑖 𝑗 + 1) is log-transformed reasoning trace length. The social variables (𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑘,𝑖 𝑗, 𝑘 = 1, ..., 8) represent the frequency of eight social behaviors. The cognitive strategy variables (𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑐,𝑖 𝑗, 𝑐 = 1, ..., 4) correspond to the frequency of four cognitive behaviors. The system of equations is defined as follows, where: 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖 𝑗 = 𝛽𝐷 𝐷𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑘_𝑟1𝑖 𝑗 + 12 𝑘=1 𝛿𝑘𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑘,𝑖 𝑗 + 4 𝑐=1 𝜃𝑐𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑘,𝑖 𝑗 + 𝛽𝐿 log(𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑖 𝑗) + 𝜀1,𝑖 𝑗 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑘,𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜆 𝑘 𝐷𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑘_𝑟1𝑖 𝑗 + 𝜀1+𝑘,𝑖 𝑗 85 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought 𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑐,𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜙𝑐 𝐷𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑘_𝑟1𝑖 𝑗 + 12 𝑘=1 𝜓𝑐𝑘𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑘,𝑖 𝑗 + 𝜀13+𝑐,𝑖 𝑗 From these structural paths, we derive the following composite effects. The composite effects for social pathway, where the increased use of conversational behaviors or Bales socio-emotional roles in DeepSeek-R1 or QwQ-32B improves accuracy, is defined as (cid:205)12 𝑘=1 (𝛿𝑘𝜆 𝑘). The cognitive pathway, where the increased use of cognitive reasoning strategies in DeepSeek-R1 or QwQ-32B enhances accuracy, is defined as (cid:205)4 𝑘=1 (𝜙𝑐𝜃𝑐). The socialcognitive pathway, where increased conversational behaviors or socio-emotional roles in DeepSeek-R1 or QwQ-32B facilitate cognitive strategies and 𝑘=1 ((cid:205)4 improve accuracy, is defined as (cid:205)12 𝑘=1 (𝛿𝑘𝜓𝑐𝑘𝜃𝑐)). The direct pathway where DeepSeek-R1 directly impacts accuracy is defined as 𝛽𝐷. The total effects are defined as (cid:205)12 𝑘=1 (𝜙𝑐𝜃𝑐) + (cid:205)12 𝑘=1 (𝛿𝑘𝜆 𝑘) + (cid:205)4 𝑘=1 ((cid:205)4 𝑘=1 (𝛿𝑘𝜓𝑐𝑘𝜃𝑐)) + 𝛽𝐷. Extended Data Fig. 4a reports summary estimates for the mediation pathways. The total effect of DeepSeek-R1 on accuracy is 0.26 (p < 0.001). This effect decomposes into: (1) direct effect of 0.06 (p < 0.001), representing variance unexplained by the measured mediators; (2) an indirect effect through social behaviors of 0.07 (p < 0.001), representing the social pathway; and (3) an indirect effect through cognitive behaviors that is not statistically distinguishable from zero (𝛽 = 0.00, > 0.05). The indirect pathway from social behaviors through cognitive behaviors to accuracy contributes an additional 0.01 (p < 0.01). See Supplementary Table 11 for the full estimates. Supplementary Methods: Cross-domain Reasoning Transfer To test whether conversational scaffolding confers domain-general reasoning advantages, we conduct supervised fine-tuning on Countdown task using conversational scaffold, the format defined in the Supervised fine-tuning section of Methods: Reinforcement learning experiments. Supervised fine-tuning data has been generated by GPT-4.1 Then, using this fine-tuned model, we conduct reinforcement learning on very different reasoning task: PolitiFact misinformation detection task. For the reinforcement learning, we use 23,299 fact-checked claims from the PolitiFact corpus, covering statements from political figures, news outlets, and social media posts from November 2007 to January 2024. The dataset includes six PolitiFact labelsTrue, Mostly True, Half True, Mostly False, False, and Pants on Firefor each statement, such as Katherine Clark stated on September 12, 2025 in post on that Republicans are spiking health insurance premiums by 75% for everyday Americans, which we recode into three categories for reasoning evaluation: True = {True, Mostly True} Half True = {Half True} False = {False, Mostly False, Pants on Fire} Next, we compare the performance of baseline models (Llama-3.2-3B and Qwen-2.5-3B) and models fine-tuned with conversational datasets across subsequent RL training steps. Specifically, we compare two conditions: (1) Baseline: no supervised priming, RL only; (2) Conversation Correct: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on correct multi-agent dialogues using Countdown task, not misinformation detection task, before RL. Supplementary Fig. 3 illustrates the learning trajectories of both conditions on the misinformation detection task. Models previously fine-tuned on conversational scaffolding on the Countdown task achieve faster early-stage gains in factual reasoning accuracy. Together, these findings demonstrate that Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought social interaction fine-tuning not only improves in-domain arithmetic reasoning but also accelerates reasoning development in very different domain like misinformation detection, highlighting the generality of socially organized reasoning. Supplementary Methods: Performance Comparison Between PPO and GRPO GRPO differs from PPO by normalizing the policy advantage within each mini-batch of reasoning trajectories and computing group-relative objective. Although GRPO can reduce variance in multisample RLHF settings, our empirical results show that standard PPO achieves comparable performance in smaller-scale reasoning experiments such as ours. Specifically, after training both algorithms for 250 steps on the Qwen-2.5-3B baseline model on the Countdown task, PPO achieved reward score (0.9 accuracy + 0.1 format) of 0.5665, whereas GRPO achieved 0.5747. Supplementary Methods: Replications on Llama-3.2-3B To assess the generalizability of our findings beyond Qwen-2.5-3B, we replicate the training pipeline using Llama-3.2-3B as base model. Llama-3.2-3B base model is supervised-fine-tuned on one of the two datasets (conversational reasoning vs. monologue-like reasoning; see Methods: Supervised finetuning datasets) using standard next-token prediction loss. For the conversation condition, reasoning content from multiple personas was concatenated into single block (<think> </think>) to ensure comparable sequence lengths across conditions in Llama-3.2-3B. This priming phase familiarizes the model with the respective format (conversational reasoning vs. monologue-like reasoning) before RL optimizes for task accuracy. Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) hyperparameters are provided in Supplementary Table 8. Reinforcement learning is performed on the Countdown arithmetic puzzle using PPO with the Verl framework. Reward is assigned as = 0.9 {Accuracy} + 0.1 {Correct Format}, where Accuracy is binary (1 if the reasoning trace leads to the correct answer, 0 otherwise) and Format is binary (1 if the reasoning trace contains at least one reasoning block and one final answer block providing single answer in equation form, 0 otherwise). Training proceeded for 250 steps. PPO hyperparameters are provided in Supplementary Table 6. To examine whether conversational behaviors emerge spontaneously during RL, we evaluate model performance on held-out validation set of 1,024 Countdown problems at each training checkpoint (every 10 steps).

Monologue-style and conversation-style fine-tuning data generated by Qwen-2.5-32B-IT Example 1: Number Theory Question: The greatest common divisor of positive integers and is 8. The least common multiple of and is 112. What is the least possible value of m+n? [Monologue-style] <think> To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. This can be expressed as: GCD(m, n) LCM(m, n) = Given that GCD(m, n) = 8 and LCM(m, n) = 112, we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 112 = 896 = Since the GCD of and is 8, we can express and as 8a and 8b respectively, where and are coprime (i.e., GCD(a, b) = 1). Substituting these into the equation, we get: 8a 8b = 896 64ab = 896 ab = 14 Now, we need to find pairs (a, b) such that ab = 14 and GCD(a, b) = 1. The pairs of factors of 14 are: (1, 14) (2, 7) Since and must be coprime, the pair (1, 14) is valid, but the pair (2, 7) is also valid because 2 and 7 are coprime. We then calculate and for each pair: 1. For = 1 and = 14: = 8 1 = 8, = 8 14 = 112, + = 8 + 112 = 120 2. For = 2 and = 7: = 8 2 = 16, = 8 7 = 56, + = 16 + 56 = 72 The least possible value of + is 72. </think> <answer> 72 </answer> [Conversation-style] <cast_of_characters> <persona1> [Thinker 1 is meticulous mathematician with strong background in number theory.

Substituting the given values, we get = 8 112 = 896. </think1> <think2> Thats good starting point. Since the GCD of and is 8, we know that both and are multiples of 8. Lets express and as = 8a and = 8b, where and are coprime integers (i.e., GCD(a, b) = 1). This gives us (8a) (8b) = 896, which simplifies to 64ab = 896. Dividing both sides by 64, we get ab = 14. </think2> <think1> Exactly. Now we need to find pairs of coprime integers (a, b) whose product is 14. The possible pairs are (1, 14) and (2, 7). Since and must be coprime, we can discard (2, 7) because 2 and 7 are both factors of 14, but they are not coprime. This leaves us with (1, 14). </think1> <think2> Wait second. We cant discard (2, 7) just yet. While its true that 2 and 7 are factors of 14, they are indeed coprime because their greatest common divisor is 1. So, the valid pairs are (1, 14) and (2, 7). </think2> <think1> Youre right. overlooked that. Lets consider both pairs. For (a, b) = (1, 14), we get = 8 1 = 8 and = 8 14 = 112. For (a, b) = (2, 7), we get = 8 2 = 16 and = 8 7 = 56. Now, we need to find the least possible value of + n. </think1> <think2> For the pair (1, 14), we have + = 8 + 112 = 120. For the pair (2, 7), we have + = 16 + 56 = 72. The least possible value of + is 72. </think2> </conversation> <group_solution> 72 </group_solution> Example 2: Combinatorics Question: Elodie is putting on fashion show and has five fabulous outfits for her five fabulous fashion models. However, on the day of the show, two of the outfits were ruined in an unfortunate permanent marker incident. Regardless, the show must go on and the remaining outfits will be presented. If each outfit can only be worn by one model and there is no time for any model to wear more than one dress, how many different shows can Elodie put on? (Note: Two shows are considered the same if they contain the same models wearing the same dresses.) [Monologue-style] <think> To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign three outfits to three models out of the original five models. Since two outfits were ruined, we only have three outfits left for the show. 1. We start with 5 models and 3 outfits. 2. The first outfit can be assigned to any of the 5 models. 3. Once the first outfit is assigned, the second outfit can be assigned to any of the remaining 4 models. 4. The third outfit can be assigned to any of the remaining 3 models. Thus, the number of ways to assign the three outfits to three of the five models is the product of these possibilities: 5 4 3 This calculation gives the total number of different shows Elodie can put on. 104 Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought </think> <answer> 60 </answer> [Conversation-style] <cast_of_characters> <persona1> [Thinker 1 is meticulous and detail-oriented mathematician who excels in combinatorics and probability.

They are quick to grasp the essence of problem and often provide practical insights.] </persona2> </cast_of_characters> <conversation> <think1> Okay, so Elodie has five outfits, but two were ruined. That leaves her with three outfits for her five models. We need to figure out how many different ways she can assign these three outfits to the models. </think1> <think2> Right, and since each model can only wear one outfit, we are essentially choosing 3 models out of 5 to wear the outfits. Then we need to think about how these outfits can be assigned to the selected models. </think2> <think1> Exactly. First, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 models out of 5. This is combination problem, and the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where is the total number of items, and is the number of items to choose. </think1> <think2> So, we have = 5 and = 3. Lets calculate that. </think2> <think1> C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5 4 3 2 1) / (3 2 1 2 1) = 10 ways to choose the 3 models. </think1> <think2> Now, for each of these 10 ways to choose the models, we need to consider how the 3 outfits can be assigned to these 3 models. This is permutation problem, as the order in which the outfits are assigned matters. </think2> <think1> Indeed, for each selection of 3 models, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to assign the 3 outfits. So, 3! = 3 2 1 = 6 ways to assign the outfits. </think1> <think2> So, the total number of different shows is the number of ways to choose the models multiplied by the number of ways to assign the outfits. Thats 10 6. </think2> <think1> Which gives us 60 different shows. Thats the answer. </think1> </conversation> <group_solution> 60 </group_solution> Example 3: Logical Reasoning Question: Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are playing game.

The statistical significance of coefficients is tested using two-sided t-tests. Out of 8,262 tasks, tasks from IFEval are excluded due to difficulties in accuracy evaluation (524 tasks), and we use the remaining 7,738 tasks."
