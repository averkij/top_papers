            "content": "Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning stateof-the-art large language models with human preferences. They serve as an oracle that reflects preferred human values and enables steering language models towards safety, reasoning, and instructionfollowing capabilities (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). As LLMs permeate daily life and are used worldwide, it is : Equal contributions. Figure 1: Performance gap between RewardBench (English) and the average M-REWARDBENCH scores across 23 languages for various reward models (Pearson r: 0.92, Spearman ρ: 0.89). All models underperform on our multilingual benchmark compared to their performance on the corresponding English benchmark. crucial to understand how their building blocks behave beyond resource-rich languages such as English or Chinese. This is especially important for reward models, as we aim for our LLMs to align with the values of diverse global population rather than specific subset. Despite their crucial role, reward model development and evaluation remain sparse, especially in multilingual contexts. This is partly due to the limited work extending preference alignment to multilingual settings (Aakanksha et al., 2024; Dang et al., 2024b). The few evaluations, to date, such as RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024) and RMB (Zhou et al., 2024), are in English and do not cover tasks related to multilinguality such as translating from one language to another or answering user requests that involve cultural nuance. Hence, multilingual RM evaluation is still largely understudied. In this work, we seek to fill this gap by curating resources and conducting systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reward models in multilingual settings. Our contributions are three-fold: We bridge the resource gap (3) by curating massively multilingual preference evaluation dataset in 23 languages across 5 tasks called MREWARDBENCH. Our language selection is diverse: containing 8 unique scripts, 8 language families, and 12 unique language subgroups. We close the evaluation gap (5) by evaluating wide range of both proprietary and open-source reward models on M-REWARDBENCH. We find that current reward models exhibit large gap between English-only and non-English settings as shown in Figure 1 with maximum drop of 13% in performance. We provide analyses and insights (6) on how robust the current reward models are in multilingual context and find that translation quality can have positive effect on RM performance. We also extend these analyses to several linguistic dimensions, such as languages resource availability, script, and family. We publicly release all data and code associated with this work.1 We hope that releasing these artifacts will aid future research in multilingual model development and evaluation."

            "content": "Preference learning and reward models Modern language models undergo preference learning stage, during which an existing instruction finetuned model (IFT) is further aligned with human values and objectives by incorporating human feedback. This feedback comes in the form of preference data, where each instance is prompt, chosen, rejected triple consisting of the prompt and pair of ranked responses. Given preference dataset, the objective of preference learning then is to maximize reward function derived from these preference annotations. There are several ways to maximize this reward function: (a) explicitly training separate reward model through sequence regression or classifier based on the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952), and then using 1The M-REWARDBENCH available https://hf.co/datasets/C4AI-Community/ dataset is at multilingual-reward-bench.

Reward model evaluation RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024) is popular benchmark for evaluating reward models. It consists of 2,985 humanvalidated triples containing prompt, the humanpreferred response (chosen), and the non-preferred response (rejected). RewardBench evaluates RMs on chat, safety, and reasoning capabilities by comparing the RMs preferred response to the chosen answer. Reward models are evaluated via an accuracy metric, i.e., by inferring the raw score an RM assigns for the prompt, chosen and prompt, rejected pairs and then assigning positive classification label if the preferred response is scored higher than the rejected one."

We evaluate several reward model types: Classifier RMs ( ), and Implicit RMs trained using DPO ( ). Full results can be found in Table 9. ), Generative RMs ( General-purpose capabilities: Chat, Safety, Reasoning To evaluate RMs on their general-purpose capabilities in another language, we first curate set of prompts by translating RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024) into 23 languages using the Google Translate API,2 which currently outperforms other translation systems for multilingual data (Xu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Lai et al., 2024, inter alia). After automatic translation, we conduct human evaluation of the translations and filter instances where the prompts contain several translation errors or English-specific concepts that may not exist or are difficult to translate into other languages. Appendix shows an analysis of these instances. We closely follow the same schema as RewardBench. As result, the translated subsets of MREWARDBENCH also contain categories for Chat, Chat-Hard, Safety, and Reasoning. Multilingual capabilities: Translation RewardBench doesnt specifically test for an RMs multilingual capabilities. To extend the evaluation suite towards that, we curated instances from MAPLE (Zhu et al., 2024). MAPLE is human preference dataset for machine translation tasks that is derived from WMT20/21 test sets containing five translations per source text with each translation scored by human translators on scale of 1 to 6. MAPLE covers four translation directions: German-to-English (deen), Chinese-toEnglish (zhen), English-to-German (ende), and English-to-Chinese (enzh). Using the MAPLE dataset, we create TRANSLATION-EASY and two subsets: TRANSLATION-HARD. To build the TRANSLATION-EASY subset, we select the translation with the highest rating and treat it as the chosen response, and the translation with the lowest rating is selected as the rejected response. For the more challenging TRANSLATION-HARD subset, we randomly select two responses from the remaining three translations such that their ratings are close to one another, and treat the higher-scoring translation as the chosen response and the lower-scoring one as the rejected response. We create 100 such chosen-rejected pairs for each of the two subsets in each of the four translation directions. To avoid noise in the chosen and rejected responses, we make sure that there is an absolute difference of at least 0.25 (5%) between the human scores for the chosen and rejected responses in the TRANSLATION-EASY subset. For the hard datasets, we increase this difference threshold to 0.50 (10%). To increase the diversity when constructing the triplets, we use the collection of 31 prompt templates from the original MAPLE dataset and randomly sample (with replacement) 100 templates that we then apply to the source texts to obtain the final prompts. This resulted in 100 2 instances for each of the four translation directions."

Finally, the strong correlation values between RewardBench and MREWARDBENCH indicate that overall, models that excel on English tasks tend to perform better on multilingual tasks as well, though not at the same level. Drop in per-category performance from English to Multilingual benchmark. To understand the factors that affect the performance drop from English to Multilingual, we analyze the per-category performance difference of the top ten models. As shown in Table 3, we find that the Chat category, consisting of translated evaluation instances from AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023b) and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024), suffers the most performance degradation for non-Generative RMs. All models show decline in performance on our multilingual benchmark in the Chat-Hard category, with an average degradation of 5.96%. We observe the smallest decline in performance in the reasoning category, with an average decrease of 2.26%. Label consistency across languages. Next, we examine the consistency of the models in labeling the same instances across different languages, using their English performance as the anchor for comparison. Figure 2 shows the average innermodel agreement, calculated by averaging the Cohens κ coefficient across 23 non-English languages, each paired with English. RMs with higher κ consistently prefer the same response for the same examples across languages, indicating greater robustness to linguistic variations and more consistency in evaluating the content of the questions. We also observe that the highest-performing models  (Table 2)  are not always the most consistent ones. For instance, Gemma-2-9-Bs average performance surpasses that of Llama-3-70B, yet the Llama-3-70B model demonstrates greater consistency in labeling across languages. Additionally, we find that inner-model agreement within each language varies from one example to the next. For instance, the distribution of Cohens κ for Indonesian in Figure 3 shows high number of instances with negative to weak agreement. When looking at specific examples, we find that majority of disagreements occur in the Chat category (as also shown in Figure 3), which consists of general chat conversations and subsets from AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023b) and MT-Bench (Zheng In addition, we also find that the et al., 2024).

Table 4 shows the scores obtained by various models on the TRANSLATION subset of M-REWARDBENCH. Full results can be found in Table 10 in the Appendix. Impact of translation direction. In most cases, we find that RMs perform better when the task is scoring translations from English. This is particularly evident in the TRANSLATION-EASY subset, where most models exhibit higher performance in enxx compared to xxen. When we analyze the TRANSLATION-HARD subset, we observe similar trend for translations from Chinese, but the opposite pattern emerges for German. Some models find it more challenging to select the better translation when the direction is from ende compared to deen. Impact of task difficulty. We observe that the difficulty of the tasks impacts performance across models. There is consistent drop from easy to hard tasks across all language pairs. For instance, the gap between enzh (Easy) and enzh (Hard) for the GPT-4-Turbo model shows that the increased difficulty level significantly reduces accuracy. This trend is mirrored in the other direction where zhen (Hard) tasks typically score lower than zhen (Easy). Overall, models that perform well on easy tasks can struggle to maintain the same level of performance on harder translations, indicating the need for more sophisticated mechanisms to handle linguistic complexity and context ambiguity in challenging scenarios.

Figure 4 illustrates the effect of translation quality on the performance of various reward models, grouped as Classifier RMs, Generative RMs, and Implicit RMs when tested on two versions of the multilingual benchmark translated using NLLB 3.3B and Google Translate. Translation Quality Impacts RM Performance. We find that translation quality influences reward model performance across all model types. We compare the translations from two automatic translations, Google Translate and NLLB 3.3B, with the former being of higher quality (Xu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Lai et al., 2024, inter alia) and found performance improvement of +1-3% when using better automatic translator as shown in Figure 4. Generative RMs achieve the highest scores. Among all models, Generative RMs (shown in purple) perform better across the board, with GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o leading with the highest scores: 83.5% (Google Translate) and 81.2% (NLLB). These results suggest that translation quality particularly benefits generative models, possibly due to their broader language understanding capabilities. Sensitivity of Classifier and Implicit RMs. Classifier RMs exhibit moderate performance gap between NLLB and Google Translate across most models. Implicit RMs exhibit the most noticeable disparity in performance, with certain models, like Mistral-2-7B-DPO and Zephyr-7B-Beta, showing weaker overall performance. The gap widens with Google Translate, where implicit RMs like BTRM Qwen-2-7B perform slightly better."

Impact of resource availability. We study the influence of resource availability on MREWARDBENCH performance based on Joshi et al. (2020)s classification: higher-numbered classes represent languages with more available resources for model training and evaluation. The trend demonstrates that RMs tend to perform better on data-rich languages. Impact of language family. We find noticeable variation in performance based on language family: Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan families, which include widely spoken languages such as English, Hindi, and Chinese, achieve the highest scores ( 67.5%). We hypothesize that their strong performance aligns with the availability of ample training data and their presence in Class-5 resource availability. On the other hand, Afro-Asiatic and Turkic families score around 62.5%, reflecting the challenges models face with lower-resource languages, particularly those from underrepresented regions or understudied grammatical structures. Impact of script. Figure 5 (right) shows the impact of script type on M-REWARDBENCH performance. The data indicates that models perform best on Latin and Cyrillic scripts (closer to 67.5%), which are more prevalent in high-resource languages like English, Spanish, and Russian."

            "content": "Multilingual Preference Optimization Existing multilingual alignment methods typically rely on classifier RMs for RLHF or generative RMs for curating preferences in DPO. Lai et al. (2023) construct synthetic preference dataset by translating an expanded version of the Alpaca dataset (Taori et al., 2023), generating model responses, and ranking back-translated outputs with ChatGPT. These ranked responses are then used to train reward model for final RLHF training. She et al. (2024) focus on enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs for non-English languages through iterative DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024). Their method involves translating questions, generating multiple completions from the initial policy, and ranking these completions by calculating the perplexity of the English ground-truth target using NLLB-600M-distilled as reward model (Costa-jussà et al., 2022). Dang et al. (2024a) use Command-R as reward model to align Aya 23 8B with RLHF. They evaluate both offline and online preference learning by translating ShareGPT into 23 languages and collecting completions from Command-R+ to curate multilingual preferences. However, none of the prior methods investigate the capabilities of classifier RMs or generative RMs in multilingual settings. Language model benchmarks on multilingual settings Several benchmarks were developed to test the multilingual capabilities of language models. These include MGSM (Shi et al., 2022), translation of 250 math problems from GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), X-Fact (Gupta and Srikumar, 2021), multilingual fact-verification benchmark, and OpenAIs MMMLU,4 translated version of the MMLU dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2020). In addition, Son et al. (2024) investigated LLM-as-a-judge and RM capabilities for Korean, and also found that LLMs have critical shortcomings in language outside of English. M-REWARDBENCH aims to provide comprehensive benchmark spanning 23 languages to test an RMs multilingual capabilities. 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/MMMLU"

            "content": "In this work, we conduct systematic evaluation of reward models in multilingual settings. To achieve this, we construct new multilingual evaluation benchmark called M-REWARDBENCH covering 23 diverse languages. This dataset addresses significant gap in the field, where RMs have predominantly been assessed in English, leaving their performance in other languages largely unknown. Our evaluation of various open-source and closedsource RMs shows significant difference in performance between English and non-English languages. We also show that translation quality and the availability of language resources are positively correlated with RM performance which further highlights the importance of having high-quality, diverse data for developing multilingual RMs. By releasing M-REWARDBENCH to the community, we aim to help facilitate further research in multilingual reward modeling. We hope that our benchmark will serve as valuable resource for developing RMs that are better aligned with human preferences of global user base."

            "content": "Generalization to downstream DPO or policy model performance. Although we evaluated how different RMs perform on MREWARDBENCH, it is unclear if high performance on M-REWARDBENCH correlates to high performance on downstream multilingual benchmarks. Meanwhile, Ivison et al. (2024) found that in the (English) RewardBench, improvements in RM performance do not necessarily translate to better downstream PPO performance. We leave this exploration for future work. Impact of automatic translations versus humanwritten translations. We did not explore whether the performance and ranking of reward models will change when human-written translations of the English dataset are used. Our analysis in 6.1 shows that when using an automatic translator of high quality, the performance of RMs will also improve. We hypothesize that using Google Translate allows us to approximate human-quality translations in scalable manner. Evaluating RMs on cultural preferences. Our analyses in show instances of preference inversion from the original preferred response in English to the human-verified response in another language. However, M-REWARDBENCH does not explicitly test these types of cultural preferences and we leave this for future work. Ralph Allan Bradley and Milton E. Terry. 1952.
