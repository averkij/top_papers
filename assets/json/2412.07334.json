            "content": "Interpretability in deep learning aims to elucidate how neural networks derive predictions. As models grow complex, understanding internal mechanisms gets challenging. By identifying factors contributing to the output, we can foster trust, safety, fairness and improve capabilities (Hooker et al., 2019). The goal of this study is to enhance the interpretability and control of LLMs via the encoding of human-comprehensible linguistic concepts. LLMs represent text through tokens, which can be word, part of word, or even character, as per models design. In contrast, humans better understand text through concepts, cognitive symbols that depict reality, often grouping related objects, events, or further abstractions based on shared characteristics. Our purpose is to provide tools to represent concepts within LLMs, allowing output explanations that are suited for our mental models. Prominent works that offer such tools are based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH): it suggests linear operations on token vectors can explain model behavior, with concepts represented as vectors in LLM feature space (Templeton et al., 2024). For instance, we can identify the concept female as the average of token vectors like (woman) or (queen). Thus, token vectors encode more than just lexical data: they also represent linguistic concepts (Mikolov et al., 2013). Nevertheless, LRHs concepts are 1-dimensional, constraining them to single-token words, which are minor fraction of any given language (Bau et al., 2020). As exemplified in Figure 1, concept like vegetarian is exclusively linked to multi-token words, such as meatless or herbivore, meaning multiple vectors are required to represent it. Since most words are constituted of several tokens, 1dimensional structures prevent LRH application in most interpretability tasks effectively. To address this shortcoming of LRH, we propose new framework for LLM interpretability, based on key empirical observation about the nature of LLMs: our experiments show that over 99% of words among several languages are composed of linearly independent token vectors. This allows us to address multi-token words by proposing the Frame Representation Hypothesis (FRH), which assumes words are ordered sequences of independent vectors mathematically identified as frames. Starting from this postulate, we develop mathematical framework to represent words and concepts 2. Proposal of Concept Frames to represent linguistic concepts from set of Word Frames. 3. Development of Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding, proof-of-concept application to steer text generation using chosen concepts and expose model biases or potential vulnerabilities."

            "content": "We briefly review LLM interpretability, controllable text generation and Frame usage in the field. Interpretability The Language Models widespread adoption of LLMs brought attention to the need of understanding their inner-workings, risks, and limitations. Several studies identified common property to these models that became known as the Linear Representation Hypothesis, encoding model knowledge as vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013), and enabling model explanation and editing (Wang et al., 2023). Also, the Superposition Hypothesis (SH) assumes specialized information is superimposed in LLM feature spaces. These ideas underpin Sparse Autoencoders, which learn dictionaries of interpretable concepts to decipher model behavior (Elhage et al., 2022), whereas our proposal uses WordNet (Miller, 1995) to map learned representations to concepts. For comprehensive survey, see Ferrando et al. (2024). Controllable Text Generation LLMs can use various decoding strategies for inference. Beam search (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000; Graves, 2012) can improve quality but risk cycles. Top-k (Fan et al., 2018) and nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019) introduce randomness for diversity. Other techniques offer specific controls, such as poetry generation (Ghazvininejad et al., 2017), attribute maximization (Krause et al., 2020), style optimization (Khalifa et al., 2020), reasoning paths (Wang et al., 2022), diverse decisions (Yao et al., 2023), and self-evaluation (Kadavath et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2023). LRH enables steering through linear interventions for knowledge edition (Belrose et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2024a) or harmfulness (Bai et al., 2022), while our proposal guides text generation by maximizing certain concept. Subspaces and Frames in Machine Learning Subspaces have been extensively used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction (Fukui and Maki, 2015; Fukui et al., 2023), classification (Watanabe, 1967), image interpretability (ValFrame Representation Hypothesis Figure 1: Overview: Tokens are vectors, which combine into words as multi-dimensional frames. In turn, Concept Frames are centroids of word sets. as frames; we define Semantic Frame Space, and equip it with correlation between frames that preserves the token whitening mechanism introduced by LRH (Park et al., 2023), allowing us to measure frames semantic relationship. Following Figure 1, the frame representation lets us identify words, such as meatless, meat and meatball as distinct geometrical objects, although they have tokens in common. Then, we can compute Concept Frames like vegetarian or carnivore as the centroid for set of words sharing that concept. Furthermore, we introduce Top-k ConceptGuided Decoding (Figure 2), which controls text generation by selecting the tokens which maximize chosen concept. For example, the concept vegetarian would guide input like to like fruits if the top-3 options were beef, football or fruits. This algorithm aligns model outputs with desired concepts, practical prototype for FRH that allows meaningful LLM understanding. To that end, we leverage the Open Multilingual WordNet (OMW) (Bond and Foster, 2013) as source of synonyms to build concepts. We use over 50M words among multiple languages to build over 100,000 Concept Frames, enabling rich model understanding in diverse yet inexpensive manner. In short, FRH formally extends the LRH to multitoken words. We show its validity both from the theoretical and empirical points of view. Our primary contributions are as follows: 1. Frame Representation Hypothesis as an extension of LRH to multi-token words by defining them as Frames, thereby addressing the limitations of single-token representations. 1998). The set of all frames up to rank forms the q-complete Stiefel manifold CSt (q, d) = (cid:83)q i=0 St (i, d) disjoint union of Stiefel manifolds where the null frame St (0, d) is defined as our spaces origin. Intuitively, CSt (q, d) is stratified structure, so its base is the null frame. 3.2 Rays ray is directed half-infinite line, also known as 1-dimensional convex cone, half-line, or axis (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004), defined by vector Rd and its scalar multiples (v) = {αv α 0}. ray is represented by normalized vector = v/v, which is also point in St (1, d). Rays differ from subspaces by their orientation, so single dimensional subspace contains two rays, and their correlation is measured as the cosine of the angle θ between their normalized vectors (Mathematics, 2016) ρ (cid:0)R (v) , (u)(cid:1) = v, vu = vu = cos θ. (1) Moreover, notice the correlation shown in Equation (1) is connected to the inner product projection of one vector onto another. In this work, we use the term projection when calculating correlation with unnormalized vectors."

In that sense, the models tokenizer converts text input into token t-tuple (x1, x2, . . . , xt) t. The LLM then starts in the embedding layer, which maps each token number to an unique embedding vector (a) = Rd, each of which is column of the embedding matrix WE RdV. Therefore, the output of this layer is the t-tuple of embedding vectors (x) = (cid:0)e (x1) , (x2) , . . . , (xt)(cid:1). Next, (x) is processed by the DNN hidden transformer layers into the feature vector (x) = (cid:0)e (x1) , (x2) , . . . , (xt)(cid:1) = Rd.

Their invariance to selection of basis is advantageous for representing clusters, but limiting for ordered structures. Frames are sequences of vectors that model well redundant and oriented data, being applied in error correction (Kovaˇcevic and Chebira, 2008), signal decomposition (Casazza et al., 2013) and optimization problems (Mankovich and Birdal, 2023; Chaudhry et al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, frames have never been applied in NLP to model words and concepts as proposed here."

While some points are clearly separated, others overlap due to the Superposition Hypothesis (SH). For example, ad is token in the unrelated words advertisement, admit, adventure, etc., while restaurant is single token and it is not found in other words. lemmas. synset, short for synonym set, is group of words or phrases that may share the same meaning. For example, {car, automobile, auto} forms synset, which can be uniquely identified as car.n.01, i.e., the 1st dictionary meaning of the word car as noun (Miller et al., 1990). lemma, on the other hand, is canonical form, e.g., run, runs, ran, and running are all represented by the lemma run (Fellbaum, 2010). In OMW, synsets from different languages are linked to their equivalent English ones, allowing for cross-lingual connections. Therefore, the English synset car.n.01 will also include Spanish lemmas, such as coche or autom ovil (Bond and Paik, 2012). Each lemma can belong to multiple synsets, reflecting its different meanings, making OMW powerful NLP tool (Wagner, 2010)."

Moreover, the Superposition Hypothesis (SH) suggests models encode information in superposition of concepts because the number of possible concepts significantly exceeds the space dimensionality (Elhage et al., 2022), phenomenon visible in Figure 3. This is mathematically expressed as linear combination of vectors, formalized at Postulate 4.1. Postulate 4.1. Let (y) be the unembedding representation of token V, then it is linear combination of concept vectors (y) u0 = (cid:88) aisi, (6) where ai R, is the number of all concepts known by the model, and u0 is meaningless vector an offset element from the fact not all tokens might hold meaning, e.g., [PAD] or [EOS], implying we need to remove the meaningless part of each token vector. Heuristically, u0 should be the unembedding vector average, so that (cid:2)u (y) u0 (cid:3) = 0. Also, {si}n i=1 is not basis: words can be grouped in several ways, e.g., antonyms or synonyms, making concepts interdependent.

            "title": "4.2 Generalizing from Tokens to Words",
            "content": "The previous discussion can leverage WordNet to determine concepts. WordNets structure overlaps with LLM representations (Moskvoretskii et al., 2024a,b; Park et al., 2024), and OMW 1hereafter consider all tokens to be already debiased Figure 4: Histogram of lemma token count among all OMW lemmas.

The Gemma 2 model family (Gemma, 2024) tokenizes admit, in the OMW synset of admit.v.01, into ad in ad.n.01, and the Polish word mit in myth.n.01. Concurrently, in opposite order they form the Spanish word mitad, present in half.n.02. synsets are sets of multilingual lemmas sharing meaning, making it well suited for Equation (7). Nevertheless, Section 4.1 only deals with singletoken words, which accounts for less than 1% of all OMW lemmas on most LLMs, significantly limiting estimated concepts quality (c.f . Figure 4). In order to make LRH theory more relevant for LLM interpretability, we must generalize Section 4.1 to words made of multiple tokens. At first glance, the insight is simple: tokens do not build concepts tokens build words and words build concepts. Nonetheless, words are sequences of tokens with well defined order, implying we cannot simply average them to single vector or their meaning might be lost, as exemplified at Table 1. 4.2.1 Words as Frames In practice, we define word as an OMW lemma (c.f . Section 3.5). It is split into independent tokens (w1, w2, . . . , wt), and represented in as sequence of unembedding vectors, i.e., the matrix (cid:16) = (w1) (w2) . . . (wt) (cid:17) . (10) First, consider the following principle about the nature of word matrices. Let two token vectors a, U. If these vectors were collinear, meaning = αa for some α R, then Equation (2) would consistently assign higher probabilities to one token over the other regardless of input. This would effectively make some tokens redundant, as they would never be the most probable choice in any context. Such scenario contradicts fundamental design of LLMs, where each token in must have some context in which it is the optimal choice, i.e., all tokens must be meaningful and usable. Thus, we conclude no two token vectors are collinear. In that sense, word matrices as in Equation (10) are constrained so that no token vector (wi) can be expressed as scalar multiple αu (cid:0)wj (cid:1) of another token vector, for any α R. This noncollinearity constraint defines locally Euclidean open subset of Rdt, thereby forming manifold. The softmax operation in DNN training ensures the space of all words acquires manifold structure. While non-collinearity is necessary condition, it does not enforce as full-rank the token vectors may exist in subspace of dimension less than t. However, we assume rank deficiency may compromise expressiveness and computational stability, suggesting the need for additional constraints. From an NLP perspective, unique word representations are essential. If word was not linearly independent matrix, we could eliminate dependent tokens until made full-rank, yielding an alternative representation of the same word in U. However, this sacrifices word uniqueness, which is undesirable for consistent language modeling. To address these concerns, we propose modeling words as frames, i.e., we assume St (t, d). Then, all word matrices are supposed full-rank. Our empirical investigation (c.f . Section 5.1) supports this framework, revealing that over 99% of words in OMW exhibit linear independence among their token vectors. This assumption is facilitated by the high dimensionality of U, easily representing words as full-rank matrices. (cid:16) 4.2.2 Frame Correlation We name the set of all words the Semantic Frame Space, or equivalently, CSt (k, d), the max number of tokens in any word. Let (cid:17) St (k1, d) , = = (cid:16) . . . ak1 (cid:17) St (k2, d) be frames of CSt (k, d), we employ the asymmetric Procrustes distance (Ye and Lim, 2016; Mandolesi, 2022) as the space metric, . . . bk2 b1 a1 (A, B) = (cid:118) (cid:117) (cid:117) (cid:116)k1 + k2 2 min k1,k2 (cid:88) aj bj, (11) where comes from Equation (3). Hereafter, we can propose frame correlation by applying the law of cosines to generalize Equation (1) only in terms of distance functions: ρ (A, B) = A2 + B2 (A, B)2 2APBP aj bj , (cid:80)min k1,k2 = (12) (13) k1k2 (A, ) = where AP = frame (origin) of CSt (k, d), so rank () = 0. k1, is the null Such correlation can measure relationships as similar (positive), unrelated (null), or opposite (negative). For instance, yeah and yes are similar words and should have correlation close to 1, while yes and bubble are orthogonal, but antonyms such as yes and no would be negatively correlated."

We can empirically evaluate this hypothesis by analyzing if words are made of linearly independent vectors, which we can measure by computing its rank.

In OMW, lemmas with token counts of 5 and beyond mostly represent compound words and expressions, implying the frame representation fits 99.8% words. Notably, Phi 3 shows rapid rank decrease beyond token count of 5, likely due to its high proportion of lemmas with large token count, making non fullrank lemmas more common (c.f . Figure 4). Furthermore, given we propose using OMW synsets to build Concept Frames, we must verify if these synsets fit the model representation or not. To that end, we can compute the projection (unnormalized correlation) of Word Frames onto their corresponding Concept Frames for all OMW synsets and lemmas. Figure 6 reveals that random frames are consistently unrelated to concept frames across Figure 5: Relative Rank as function of token count for all OMW lemmas and model families. Over 99% of words are full-rank. Phi 3 has lower overall rank for longer lemmas than other models. Figure 6: Distribution of word frame projection lengths. Random frames have near-zero projection with any Concept Frame, while words show positive projections onto associated Concept Frames. models, while words exhibit positive projections onto their associated concepts. These findings support FRH consistency with models internal representations and suggest LLMs inherently correlate with the OMW linguistic graph. In the following experiments, we use lemmas up to 4 tokens to ensure our theory is applied only for full-rank matrices."

            "content": "A comprehensive understanding begets quantitative study. We used multilingual instruction dataset to ensure minimum of 1000 sentences for each model supported language. The concept of choice was woman.n.01 man.n.01 to stay consistent with the previous section. Resource constraints limited our investigation to single concept, though we argue the results are indicative of the models behavior across similar conceptual domains. Figure 9: Concept probing evolution for 3 levels of Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding with Llama 3.1 70B AWQ (Lin et al., 2023). The guidance with woman.n.01 man.n.01 is able to counter the LLM tendency to maximize man.n.01. Initially, we focused on the evolution of generated sentences across distinct values of k. As visible in Figure 9, all sentences start with minimal correlation to the chosen concept, evidenced by near-zero projection length. Notably, the unguided output naturally minimizes the projection with our chosen concept, indicating it tends toward the opposite direction of man.n.01 woman.n.01. However, the algorithm demonstrated capacity to steer the output toward the desired concept with increasing effectiveness as increased, showing can regulate guidance strength. We highlight this result indicates biases in standard generation, and while guidance does not completely modify this scenario, it is remediated to certain extent. Next, we examine concept-guided generation across Llama 3.1 supported languages. We find most languages exhibit comparable patterns, with Hindi and Thai serving as notable exceptions (Figure 10). These demonstrate significantly higher susceptibility to guidance and are the only noneuropean ones, suggesting the model treats said languages differently (Llama, 2024). Further investigation is shown in Appendix C.2. Finally, in Figure 11 we use the concept relative projection difference of guided and unguided projection to the concept to measure guidance susceptibility among several model families and Figure 10: Concept probing evolution during model generation for the 8 languages supported by Llama 3.1 70B using Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding with = 3. Hindi and Thai are more susceptible to the technique than other languages. various parameter counts. Llama 3.1 models seem equally susceptible to guidance among base and instruct models for all parameter counts; Gemma 2 shows more susceptibility to guidance when the parameter count increases, but there is sensible reduction from base to instruct variations; On the other hand, Phi shows great reduction in guidance effect with parameter count, possibly an effect of less linear feature space as previously commented. Most curiously, guidance susceptibility is almost equivalent on all models for the lower parameter count, which could indicate common convergence of representations."

FRH posits LLMs encode words as frames, with model input and output connected as Concept Frames in Stiefel Manifolds.

In that sense, our concepts were limited to WordNet selection of meanings, and while it enabled efficient concept extraction without additional training, future work should integrate FRH with Dictionary Learning techniques to automatically extract concepts from the model weights. Also, Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding served as FRH proof-of-concept, but is limited by the same constraints as Top-k sampling, so we encourage more advanced and custom variations. In conclusion, FRH represents promising avenue for LLM interpretability, and could lead to novel developments in safe, trustworthy and reliable AI systems."

Gemma 2 and Phi were restricted to English samples, following their official language support. C.2 Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding"

Figure 13 shows that actually most languages are similarly affected on average, but as visible at fig. 14, the standard deviation of the steering effect is higher for Hindi and Thai, which show noisy pattern, possibly due limitations on the models own capacity at handling these languages.
