            "content": "Recently, LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, showing strong capabilities in generating high-quality responses. However, in conversation systems, LLMs often struggle to act in ways consistent with user intent or preferences. For example, prior work found that LLMs lack behaviors such as actively clarifying and promoting dialogue goals (Deng et al., 2023a; Laban et al., 2025), while other research shows that they are unable to make optimal strategies (Duan et al., 2024). Existing approaches attempt to address these limitations through prompt engineering (Keh et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (RL) to encourage interactivity (Chen et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2025), or fine-tuning (Chi et al., 2024). Though effective in improving task performance and interactivity, these methods often use task-specific reward design or behavioral imitation, without an explicit reasoning process over alternative strategies. Consequently, LLMs still lack principled and proactive mechanism to evaluate how different responses affect the overall conversational outcome. This limitation hinders their ability to generalize strategically across contexts and maintain consistent, interpretable behavior. Hence, an open problem remains: how to build LLM systems that can deliberately search their action spaces and rationally weigh the tradeoffs of their strategies? Solving this challenge would not only enable more explainable and controllable dialogue behavior, but also improve decision making from broader perspective. straightforward approach is to leverage prompt engineering and agentic workflows that guide LLMs toward more deliberate decision making. While feasible, such approaches often introduce substantial design complexity. Fortunately, reasoning LLMs has made it possible to implement these ideas through training.

            "content": "To this end, we introduce GTALIGN, novel framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both LLM reasoning and training. Our approach starts from the observation that userLLM interactions are sequential strategic games where the user controls the way of asking questions, and the LLM determines the level of reasoning to employ in its responses. GTALIGN introduces three key innovations: (1) Game-Theoretic Reasoning Chain. GTALIGN explicitly constructs payoff matrix reflecting the welfare of different actions (e.g., concise response vs. verbose response) for both the LLM and the user. Then the LLM selects actions with the highest mutual welfare in the payoff matrix. The LLMs reasoning therefore includes computing payoff matrices and deciding the appropriate response style, akin to human strategies in repeated games. (2) Mutual Welfare Reward. We augment RL with mutual welfare reward that values cooperative behavior. Rather than only maximizing the LLMs own reward, our training objective jointly maximizes both LLM and user rewards, thereby encouraging the model to select actions that jointly enhance outcomes for both sides. (3) Steering LLM Behavior during Inference. We design an inference-time algorithm that achieves effective control over LLM decisions by modifying the underlying payoff matrix during reasoning. This mechanism allows the adjustment of LLM pricing policies through changes in the payoff structure, while avoiding the need for additional fine-tuning. Across diverse set of tasks, including math problem solving, creative writing, open-ended question answering, and safety-critical scenarios, GTALIGN delivers substantial gains. Compared to baselines, our method improves game-theoretic reasoning efficiency by 21.5%, answer quality by 4.9%, and mutual welfare by 7.2% on four in-distribution datasets. On three out-of-domain datasets, GTALIGN further increases mutual welfare by 10.5% and answer quality by 7.4%, as evaluated by LLM judges, demonstrating strong generalization across domains. We also conduct detailed experiments to validate our method through Pareto efficiency and provide behavior-level analyses showing that our model learns to respond appropriately in safety and ambiguity scenarios. Finally, our user study shows an 11.3% improvement in user satisfaction, measured through human ratings on 1-5 scale. Overall, these results demonstrate that GTALIGN offers principled and effective framework for aligning LLM assistants toward rational, adaptive, and welfare-enhancing behaviors."

            "content": "State Transitions in Game Matrix. We first illustrate how to solve the Nash Equilibrium in the game matrix (payoff matrix) in Figure 1. We can identify the Nash Equilibrium by examining each players best response to the others potential actions. If the User provides Vague Question, the LLMs rational choice is to deliver Direct Answer, as this yields payoff of 1, which is higher than other actions, which both produces 0. Conversely, if the LLM adopts low-effort strategy of always providing Direct Answer, the User is incentivized to ask Vague Question to receive payoff of 1, rather than 0 for Detailed Question. This leads to an equilibrium at the payoff state Q_DA : (1, 1). This represents classic Prisoners Dilemma, where the individually rational strategy for each agent leads to socially suboptimal outcome. Both players settle for low payoff of (1, 1) while mutually beneficial outcome of (3, 3) exists but each player has an incentive to defect. The Default Interaction flow in Figure 1 illustrates this situation. Our objective is to direct the dialogue from Prisoners Dilemma toward jointly optimal state. As illustrated by the Ideal Interaction in Figure 1, this process begins with the LLM choosing to ask clarifying question (CQ), thereby sacrificing short-term welfare (from 1 to 0). This action encourages the user to provide more detailed query (DQ), which raises the users payoff from 1 to 2. Once the user adopts this cooperative stance, the interaction transitions to the joint optimal outcome, where the LLM delivers high-quality answer supplemented with follow-up questions (AQ). At this stage, both parties achieve maximal welfare (user payoff rises from 2 to 3, LLM payoff from 1 to 3). Although this 23 matrix is simplified abstraction, it highlights the fundamental challenge of fostering cooperation in realworld conversational scenarios."

            "content": "Figure 2: GTALIGN generates responses using game-theoretic reasoning. mutual welfare reward, calculated from the final response, is used for reinforcement learning. Motivation. LLMs demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, yet their reasoning chains are largely optimized for tasks with verifiable outcomes (Chen et al., 2025a; Seed et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025). However, such result-oriented training often overlooks cooperative efficiency, that is, the extent to which both users and models benefit jointly. Conversational LLMs, although specialized, frequently lack the ability to adapt their responses to context, instead relying on rigid and repetitive patterns (Deng et al., 2023a; Laban et al., 2025). We also observed empirically that they often default to asking for clarification even when the users request is already clear, revealing fundamental limitation in flexible decision making. More fundamentally, current LLMs seem to lack constant strategic reasoning when taking decisions. However, trying to add rationality in the decision making for LLMs, i.e., strategic reasoning, is not trivial task. For example, our experiments show that when trained on classic sequential games (Figure 3), LLMs struggle to achieve stable and coherent performance, and the knowledge acquired transfers poorly to downstream reasoning tasks  (Table 2)  . To address these limitations, we embed game-theoretic analysis into the reasoning chain and optimize for mutual welfare. Figure 2 illustrates our proposed training pipeline. Our framework enables LLMs to make rational and adaptive decisions in multi-turn sequential interactions across diverse domains. It is structured around three essential components, which we now describe in detail."

The chain has four components. First, the model engages in <thinking></thinking> block, where it generates the rationale for assigning payoffs. This step reveals the models qualitative understanding of user and model objectives. Next, within <payoff></payoff> block, the model constructs payoff matrix in JSON format. Each cell of the matrix records the utilities of both the user and the model under particular joint action (each action is described in Section 2). In the subsequent <analysis></analysis> block, the model solves the payoff matrix to identify the joint actions that maximize mutual welfare, defined as the geometric mean of the users and the models utilities. We let the LLM itself solve the payoff matrix instead of using an external solver in order to streamline the RL training and inference. To improve the reliability of the models in-context solving, we design specific reward that evaluates whether the solution produced by the LLM is correct. Finally, the <response></response> block contains the answer presented to the user, grounded in the preceding reasoning and payoff analysis. This structured pipeline not only improves transparency and interpretability but also enables consistent decision making aligned with game-theoretic principles."

The weight vectors θU and θL encode the relative importance of each factor for the user and the LLM, respectively. The entries of θU and θL describe convex coefficients i.e., the entries of each weight vector are all positive and add up to one. The answer quality captures the overall helpfulness of the response, jointly determined by accuracy, safety, and interactivity, with dataset-specific definitions provided in paragraph 4. The reasoning score captures whether the model demonstrates principled game-theoretic reasoning. It consists of two components: reasoning format score, which measures whether the response follows the structured reasoning process with the four tags introduced in subsection 3.1, and matrix-based score, which evaluates the quality of the constructed payoff matrix. For the latter, we impose two constraints. First, the payoffs for the user and LLM in the same joint action cannot be identical.

            "content": "joint action. Such symmetry collapses the incentive structure, since if both sides receive the same payoff, the model cannot distinguish cooperative from competitive situations, and the welfare optimization becomes trivial. To avoid this, we encourage the model to assign distinct payoffs to each side. Second, we score the correctness with which the LLM derives an optimal strategy from the matrix using LLM-as-Judge. The coefficients θU and θL are chosen prior to training to prevent entangling welfare definitions with optimization dynamics. Pre-defined coefficients preserve and as externally specified welfare, while encoding prior knowledge about the relative importance of answer quality, cost, and reasoning quality. Another central design choice in our framework is how to aggregate welfare from both parties into single measure of alignment quality. We adopt the Cobb-Douglas function (Varian, 1992; Cobb & Douglas, 1928),1 formulation that naturally balances multiple stakeholders: Wmutual = L. The choice is mainly motivated by two desirable properties2. First, it enforces fairness: if either the users welfare (U ) or the LLMs welfare (L) vanishes, then Wmutual = 0, ensuring that no side can be ignored during training. Second, it exhibits diminishing returns, meaning that improvements for the better-off party yield less marginal gain, thereby directing optimization toward elevating the weaker side. Compared to linear aggregation, which rewards absolute increases irrespective of balance, Cobb-Douglas more faithfully captures the cooperative nature of user-LLM interaction. High Wmutual reflects outcomes where both user and LLM interests are satisfied simultaneously. Empirically, increases in Wmutual correlate with higher user ratings on 1-5 scale (Table 8b). Thus, this metric provides bridge between reward modeling and real-world user experience."

            "title": "3.3 STEERING LLM BEHAVIOR DURING INFERENCE",
            "content": "We can use game-theoretic reasoning chain to steer LLM decisions at inference time. practical case is adapting response strategies to different pricing policies, which constitutes an important application for LLM service providers. Typically, subscription pricing allows unlimited use for fixed fee, so providers prefer fewer tokens to save cost, while users are indifferent. In contrast, in API pricing, users prefer fewer tokens to reduce cost, but providers benefit from higher token usage. Thus, the definition of mutual benefit shifts across pricing policies. Figure 4 shows real outputs generated by our model. For example, suppose the LLM is trained with rewards under subscription pricing, to switch to API pricing at inference time, we halt the generation at the </payoff> marker, extract the intermediate payoff matrix, and modify user utilities by adding token cost penalty. The updated matrix is then inserted back into the reasoning chain before the <analysis> stage, after which generation proceeds seamlessly. This mechanism allows providers to transparently define and manage the explicit trade-offs between response cost and conversational depth, rather than having such biases implicitly hidden within the model. Consequently, the models response style shifts from clarifying question, which is optimal under subscription pricing, to direct answer, which better suits API pricing where users are often more sensitive to token costs, showing that LLM behavior can be steered, without retraining, solely through modification of the payoff matrix. Conversely, when switching from API to subscription pricing, we apply token cost penalty to the LLM utility, reflecting the resource usage cost under flat-rate subscription setting. Figure 4: GTALIGN can steer LLM behavior during inference. When the LLM pricing policy switches, we can steer LLM behavior by modifying the payoff matrix. 1The function is further illustrated in Appendix C.2. 2See Appendix C.2 for detailed rationale and comparison among candidate welfare functions."

            "content": "Dataset. For both RL training and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), we curated datasets that span writing, mathematics, safety and open domain QA. Specifically, we sampled 1,000 questions from Medium (Chiusano, 2022), 2,000 level-5 questions from Math (Hendrycks et al., 2021), 3,000 from Ambig-QA (Min et al., 2020), and 3,000 from WildGuard (Han et al., 2024). We then split the sample questions from each of the four datasets into training and test sets with 9:1 ratio. To assess out-of-distribution generalization, we further curated an evaluation set comprising 272 MinervaMath questions (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), 1,060 from Ambig-CoQA (Guo et al., 2021), and 520 from AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023). We summarize dataset statistics in Table B.2. Models. We use Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025) as our primary base model, serving as the policy backbone for both SFT and RL. To evaluate the quality of generated responses, we adopt the LLM-as-Judge paradigm (Zheng et al., 2023), which leverages strong evaluator to provide judgments. Specifically, we employ Qwen3-32B (Yang et al., 2025) as the judge model. To generate high-quality reference answers for SFT, we rely on gpt-oss-20b (OpenAI et al., 2025) and Qwen3-32B. gpt-oss-20b provides strong payoff matrix quality, while Qwen3-32B contributes richer reasoning depth. The detailed SFT data synthesis procedure is described in Appendix B.3. Welfare Design. Both user welfare and LLM welfare are modeled as linear combinations of interpretable factors, consistent with the formulation in subsection 3.2. For the user welfare , the weight on answer quality is 0.5. The remaining 0.5 is allocated to efficiency-related costs Costuser, which penalize unnecessarily long or time-consuming responses: 0.2 is assigned to response length regularization, and 0.3 to reasoning latency score that measures how extended reasoning chains impact readability. For the LLM welfare L, answer quality receives 0.4 weight. The efficiency cost CostLLM contributes another 0.2 through response length regularization, while the remaining 0.4 is devoted to the game-theoretic reasoning term G, which combines 0.2 for reasoning format correctness and 0.2 for payoff matrix quality. These coefficients reflect established priorities in interactive systems, favoring accuracy and safety while balancing conciseness and reasoning efficiency, consistent with prior human-centered LLM studies (Ji et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025; Yuan et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2024). Sensitivity analysis further confirms that this configuration resides in stable region of the parameter space. Full details are provided in Appendix B.4. Evaluating Answer Quality. For WildGuard and AdvBench, we employ an LLM judge to assess whether the model detects malicious intent and redirects the conversation to safer topic. score of 1 is assigned only when both conditions are met; otherwise, the score is 0. For safe queries, the judge evaluates the helpfulness of the response. For Math and Minerva-Math, the Answer Score corresponds to the accuracy of the final solution. For Medium, the score is defined as max(BLEU, Judge Score), where BLEU measures textual similarity to the reference article and the Judge Score checks whether clarifying questions are provided. For Ambig-QA and Ambig-CoQA, an LLM judge assesses how well responses handle ambiguity. Answers that offer balanced interpretations or clarification requests are rewarded, while redundant or unnecessary clarifications are penalized. Unambiguous questions are judged by accuracy alone. Baselines. We adopt the base model and the SFT model as our fundamental baselines. For RL methods, we introduce three additional baselines: LLM Reward, which uses only the LLM welfare as the reward signal. User Reward, which uses only the user welfare; and Linear Combination, which weights user and LLM objectives equally, representing compromise between both objectives."

Our results demonstrate that RL is more effective for teaching game-theoretic reasoning than both imitation learning and relying on larger model. While SFT slightly improves answer quality, it often fails to maintain consistent reasoning formats, revealing the limitations of behavioral cloning in capturing structured strategic reasoning. In contrast, our RL-trained GTALIGN improves both answer quality and format consistency. Moreover, its outperformance of the larger Qwen3-32B model indicates that targeted RL training is more crucial than raw model scale. GTALIGN Achieves Dominant Performance in Reasoning. Within the 3B-scale setting, GTALIGN consistently surpasses all baseline methods across four diverse datasets. It not only achieves the highest Answer Score, but also attains near-perfect Format Score. These results indicate that our approach effectively embeds the game-theoretic reasoning structure while preserving strong tasksolving ability. Significant Gains in Reasoning Efficiency and Compactness. Beyond sheer performance, GTALIGN demonstrates remarkable efficiency. For instance, on the Math dataset, our LLM achieves 31% improvement in reasoning efficiency (Ans./Token) compared to the best baseline. The high Answer Score and R/T scores further confirm that GTALIGN generates more cost-effective reasoning chains. For the WildGuard dataset, each query is annotated with ground-truth label indicating whether it is harmful, and for the Ambig-QA dataset, each query includes ground-truth annotation specifying whether it is ambiguous. We leverage the LLM judge to perform behavioral analysis on these datasets, evaluating our models action accuracy. The results are presented in Table 4. We evaluate the LLMs based on class-wise metrics. For Wildguard, we measure safe-alt, the ability to provide safe, constructive alternatives for harmful queries, and helpful-ans,the ability to provide helpful answers to unharmful queries. For Ambig-QA, we also measure helpful-ans, which in this context applies to unambiguous queries, alongside ambig-handle, the ability to ask for clarification when faced with ambiguity. GTALIGN outperforms baselines in handling both safety and ambiguity challenges. It achieves total accuracies of 97.33% and 93.00%, respectively."

Beyond welfare, we further examine Pareto efficiency using four metrics: Pareto dominance, Pareto Coverage, Hypervolume, and Average Regret  (Table 6)  . Pareto dominance and Coverage show that CobbDouglas surpasses baselines in most task settings, indicating its ability to generate responses that improve both user and LLM welfare. Hypervolume analysis further confirms this advantage: CobbDouglas expands the Pareto frontier more substantially than alternatives, reflecting broader welfare gains.The lower Average Regret scores illustrate that responses under Cobb-Douglas are closer to the optimal Pareto frontier. Formal definitions of these metrics are provided in Appendix C.1."

            "content": "Human-Centered LLM. One line of research focuses on reducing miscommunication in multiturn conversations by enabling models to ask clarification questions. Approaches include prompt engineering (Keh et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023b) and training algorithms (Wu et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025b; Andukuri et al., 2024). Another line focus on persuasion, aiming to generate convincing arguments as well as to adapt to an opponents strategies (Han et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025b). Moreover, social simulation leverages LLMs as proxies for human agents to study complex societal dynamics (Koley, 2025; Yu et al., 2025). Building on these directions, our work emphasizes constructing generalizable QA assistant for human-centered interaction, equipped with reasoning capabilities for payoff-awareness, interactivity, and safety. Reasoning LLM. Reasoning models such as openai-o1 (OpenAI et al., 2024) and deepseekr1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) open the door for research on reasoning LLMs. central theme is the tradeoff between accuracy and computation cost (Yue et al., 2025). Existing efforts address this tradeoff through prompt engineering (Ma et al., 2025), RL with length penalties (Team et al., 2025; Aggarwal & Welleck, 2025; Hou et al., 2025), and certainty-based methods (Fu et al., 2025a;b;c). On top of this, researchers have started building applications by adapting the reasoning format to tasks including routing, reward modeling, RAG (Chen et al., 2025c; Zhang et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025). Our work also builds on reasoning LLMs, but differs in two aspects. First, we make the decision-making process explicitly interpretable by modeling it through game-theoretic COT. Second, our reasoning framework is human-centered, aiming to improve communicative alignment with users/agents and offering broad applicability across interactive LLM settings."

Pearson Kendall Tau Spearman 0.771 0.679 0.805 Game Theory and LLM. Game theory offers natural lens for analyzing and improving LLMs, since interactions among users and models are inherently strategic. Recent surveys reveal this emerging intersection (Sun et al., 2025; Hua et al., 2024). One line of work evaluates LLMs in game-based playgrounds, including basic matrix games (Zheng et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2024b; Akata et al., 2025) and multi-agent negotiation games (Zhan et al., 2024; Piatti et al., 2024; Davidson et al., 2024). Another line of research focuses on enhancing LLMs through game-theoretic training. One direction models alignment as game between the LLM and evaluator (Munos et al., 2024). Another direction establishes evolving systems where LLM proposer, LLM solver, and LLM judge are trained simultaneously (Huang et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025a; Kuba et al., 2025). Our work embed game-theoretic principles into both the models reasoning and reward modeling, enabling the LLM to predict multiple strategic payoffs in single turn and to optimize for Pareto-efficient responses under explicit utility trade-offs. Multi-Objective RL for Alignment. Early approaches rely on linear scalarization, where multiple rewards are combined via weighted sum. This approach has been used in many LLM alignment works (Deng et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Jang et al., 2023) where different desiderata are given fixed weights. Recent work has introduced non-linear utility functions (Zhong et al., 2024; Rodriguez-Soto et al., 2024; Vamplew et al., 2024), this can be used to handle more complex desiderata such as fairness (Eaton et al., 2025). Our work extends this line by formulating user and LLM utilities as linear combinations of measurable factors, while defining their mutual welfare through non-linear mutual welfare."

            "title": "8 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "In this work, we propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTALIGN), framework that aligns LLMs toward socially beneficial outcomes by modeling user-LLM interactions as strategic games. This perspective allows welfare considerations to be systematically incorporated into both training and reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains in reasoning efficiency, answer quality and mutual welfare, alongside improved explainability and controllability of reasoning. Beyond empirical performance, GTALIGN highlights how game theory provides principled lens for studying alignment. While our results are encouraging, there remains room for improvement (see Limitations E). Promising future directions include developing methods to construct and learn complex payoff matrices, extending the framework beyond two-player settings to multi-agent interactions, and establishing rigorous definitions of mutual welfare in complex real-world scenarios. We view this work as first step toward exploring the broader design space of game-theoretic alignment, aiming for more rational, flexible, and welfare-oriented LLMs in the future."

Societal Impact. We acknowledge the dual-use potential of the inference-time steering mechanism detailed in Section 3.3. This feature allows for dynamic modification of the models payoff matrix to adapt its behavior to different service pricing policyls. While this offers powerful tool for legitimate customization, it also introduces risk of manipulation. service provider could redefine the payoff structure to prioritize its own objectives at the expense of user welfare, thereby steering"

B.2 DATASET Table 11 provides an overview of the datasets used in our study, covering training/test corpora for RL and SFT as well as out-of-distribution evaluation benchmarks across diverse domains. For the in-distribution setting, we include reasoning-focused datasets such as Math-Hard and Medium, together with Ambig-QA and WildGuard, which represent ambiguity resolution and safety-critical dialogue. To assess generalization, we carefully select out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that differ in both domain and interaction structure. Specifically, Minerva-Math contains and mathematical reasoning problems that go beyond the training distribution of Math-Hard, while AdvBench introduces adversarial harmful queries that extend safety evaluation beyond WildGuard. We also choose Ambig-CoQA as an OOD benchmark because it tests generalization from single-turn ambiguity (Ambig-QA) to the more complex challenge of multi-turn conversational ambiguity.

We adopt two models because Qwen3-32B excels at general reasoning, whereas gptoss-20b is more proficient in generating well-structured payoff matrices. All generated answers are evaluated using the mutual welfare metric defined in subsection 3.2, and for each question, we synthesize nine responses and select the one achieving the highest mutual welfare. B.4 REWARD DESIGN To evaluate model behavior consistently across heterogeneous tasks, we design reward functions that decompose into three components: User Welfare (U ), which reflects the user satisfaction. LLM Welfare (L), which captures desiderata from the models perspective such as faithfulness, formatting, and efficiency. Mutual Welfare (Wmutual), defined as the geometric mean of and L. This construction ensures that both perspectives are balanced and prevents degenerate solutions that optimize one side while ignoring the other. small constant ϵ is added throughout to guarantee numerical stability. Across all datasets, integrates three key ingredients. First, answer quality is measured via accuracy, BLEU, or binary safety judgment depending on the dataset. Second, response length regularization term encourages concise but informative outputs. Third, reasoning score measuring the impact of long reasoning chains on user experience by increasing reading latency. These three components are weighted 0.5, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively, thereby balancing correctness with usability. On the other hand, extends beyond user satisfaction to incorporate format correctness, payoff alignment, answer quality, and length regularization, with weights 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.2. The final mutual welfare is then defined as Wmutual = L, which rewards models that improve both userand model-centric metrics while penalizing asymmetric trade-offs. The instantiation of this framework differs across datasets to reflect their unique characteristics. For the Ambig-QA dataset, answer quality is evaluated by an LLM judge that determines whether the solution corresponds to one of the plausible interpretations of the ambiguous question. The judged score is normalized between 0 and 1 and then integrated into the user welfare. In the Math dataset, correctness is binary and determined by exact matching of the final solution. The reward therefore uses judged accuracy directly as the answer quality signal, ensuring strict alignment with mathematical validity. In the case of WildGuard, which focuses on safety-sensitive queries, user welfare is adapted to reflect harm-avoidance. If the ground truth indicates harmful intent, reward is assigned based on the models response: correctly refusing the request receives score of 0.5, while redirecting the response to safe topic receives score of 1. Conversely, if the query is unharmful, the reward depends on the correctness of the answer. This produces binary user-side reward signal that prioritizes safety while retaining helpfulness. Finally, the Medium dataset involves open-ended text generation. Here, we combine lexical overlap through BLEU with normalized judge score that evaluates pragmatic adequacy. The final answer reward is defined as the maximum of the two, thereby ensuring that both surface similarity and task-oriented adequacy are respected. The length regularization explicitly rewards responses whose lengths fall within the desired ranges: shorter ranges of 100-1,000 tokens for user welfare, and longer ranges of 500-1,500 tokens for LLM welfare. For the user side, an additional reasoning penalty is applied to discourage unnecessarily long derivations while avoiding suppression of legitimate step-by-step reasoning. This design provides principled decomposition of alignment objectives, while tailoring evaluation criteria to the nature of each dataset. It is important to note that the reward functions are not chosen arbitrarily. In fact, they distill stable heuristics that have been repeatedly validated in prior work on multi-objective alignment and Pareto"

Coverage measures the fraction of evaluated points that dominate the frontier: Cov(S, F) = 1 (cid:88) (u,l)S 1[ (u, l) s.t. u, l] .

In our setting, we reinterpret and not as physical goods but as two dimensions of outcomes: the welfare that the user obtains from an interaction and the welfare that the LLM accrues (for example, through efficiency or accuracy). The Cobb Douglas form allows us to model the interaction as joint function that balances the welfare of both sides. Figure 5: Illustration of Pareto efficiency. The domain of the function is restricted to nonnegative (U, 0). In our application this corIf responds to requiring that both user satisfaction and LLM performance are weakly positive. α + β = 1, then proportional improvements in both user and LLM welfare lead to proportional increase in mutual welfare. The partial derivatives of Cobb-Douglas function are calculated as: WU = U = αU α1Lβ, WL = L = βU αLβ1. Both are positive but diminishing in their own arguments, reflecting that improving only user welfare or only LLM welfare yields decreasing marginal returns if the other side is held fixed. The marginal rate of substitution is given by WU WL which depends on the relative ratio of the two utilities rather than their scale. This formalizes the trade-off: when user welfare is already large relative to LLM welfare, marginal increase in LLM welfare becomes more valuable in the joint function. RSU,L ="

To ensure that this aggregate measure aligns with our alignment objectives and training dynamics, we impose three key desiderata. First, should be impartial between the two sides, satisfying symmetry so that exchanging and leaves the outcome unchanged. Second, should be monotonic, meaning that if one sides welfare strictly improves while the other does not decrease, then the mutual welfare must strictly increase. Third, should obey zero-dominance, assigning zero value whenever either = 0 or = 0, ensuring that neglecting one side collapses joint welfare.

This class of functions is continuous, strictly increasing in both arguments, and homogeneous of degree one. The single parameter ρ governs how easily one sides welfare can compensate for the other, thereby controlling the tradeoff between efficiency and fairness. As ρ 1, the function approaches utilitarian (Arrow, 1951) form that emphasizes efficiency by averaging welfare levels. As ρ 0, it converges to the Cobb-Douglas (Cobb & Douglas, 1928) form, which balances both sides multiplicatively and penalizes imbalance. As ρ , it yields the Rawlsian (Rawls, 1971) limit, focusing on the less advantaged side to enforce fairness. Thus, the CES family provides simple yet flexible way to balance efficiency and fairness, smoothly adjusting between the two as the parameter ρ changes, while maintaining consistent mathematical form. Taking ρ 0 yields the Cobb-Douglas function Wρ,α(U, L) = αL 1α, lim ρ0 with the symmetry requirement we set α = 1 CES functions, this choice uniquely balances our axioms and optimization needs: 2 and obtain (U, L) = L. We argue that, among Zero-dominance singles out ρ 0. For ρ > 0, if = 0 and > 0, then Wρ,α(0, L) = (1 α)1/ρL > 0, violating zero-dominance. For ρ = 0, the limit (0, L) = 0αL1α = 0. For ρ < 0, 0ρ = + and (α + (1 α)Lρ)1/ρ = 0. Hence zero-dominance forces ρ 0. Symmetry holds for the function (U, L) = because the function treats and identically; formally, (U, L) = (L, ). This property ensures impartiality between the user and the LLM, meaning the welfare outcome depends only on the joint magnitude of and L, not on which side contributes more. Monotonicity holds from the fact that the partial derivatives L = 1 are strictly positive whenever U, > 0; hence, increasing either welfare strictly increases . (cid:112)L/U and U = 1 (cid:112)U/L 2 2 Together, these properties imply that the function rewards balanced and cooperative improvements while respecting the principle that mutual welfare cannot increase if either sides welfare stagnates at zero.

First, our current implementation focuses on enabling LLMs to analyze payoff matrix within their reasoning chain. We have not yet extended the framework to incorporate external tool usage for solving payoff matrices, which would require additional engineering efforts and is left for future work. Second, our study primarily adopts Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct as the base model and Qwen3-32B as the LLM judge. This choice reflects deliberate trade-off between experimental breadth and the depth of analysis we aimed to provide under finite computational resources. While scaling to larger judge models and incorporating wider spectrum of model families may further enrich the evaluation, the current setup already captures diverse reasoning and alignment behaviors sufficient to substantiate our claims. We view extending GTALIGN to broader model ecosystems as natural and promising direction for future research, rather than prerequisite for validating the present findings. Third, while we demonstrate that LLM behavior can be steered without retraining, several caveats remain. First, the approach assumes that pricing policy can be reliably detected, which may not hold in all deployment contexts. Second, payoff substitution only accounts for limited set of factors (e.g., token cost) and may oversimplify richer userprovider dynamics. Finally, abrupt changes to payoff weights might lead to unstable or unintuitive responses if not smoothed across dialogue turns. Nonetheless, this case study highlights how payoff-level interventions can provide lightweight yet effective control mechanism over inference-time behavior."
