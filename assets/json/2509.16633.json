            "content": "Large vision and language models (L-VLMs) have recently made remarkable progress on various vision and language tasks, including visual question answering (VQA) (Liu et al., 2024; Dai et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Ghosh et al., 2024). This makes them de facto first choice *Equal contribution. Figure 1: Small models often struggle to match the performance of their larger counterparts. We show model sizes using circle with radius proportional to the parameter count, and their respective inference time and VQA accuracies in and Y-axis, respectively on one of the datasets used in this paper (Singh et al., 2019). Proposed MPA significantly enhances VQA accuracy for five S-VLMs across four datasets. (Best viewed in color). for the VQA task on new data set that does not have labeled training samples. However, L-VLMs may not be the most practical choice in resourceconstrained settings and especially for inferenceheavy tasks such as VQA, due to their high computational requirements and latency. In contrast, smaller vision and language models (S-VLMs) are more efficient but fall significantly short in performance, as shown in Figure 1. This raises critical question: Can we improve S-VLMs by relevant and effective knowledge transfer from L-VLMs? Several techniques have been explored to transfer knowledge from large neural models to smaller ones such as: (i) knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015; Sanh et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2024; Ko et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024; Shu et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024) trains small model (student) to mimic large model (teacher) by learning from its soft labels or intermediate representations. However, KD typically relies on labeled training data, which may not always be available, and effectively distilling multimodal knowledge remains challenge due to the complex interplay between vision and language features. (ii) Adapter-based methods (Houlsby et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Dettmers et al., 2023) introduce lightweight trainable layers into large models to enable efficient fine-tuning. Although these methods reduce training costs, they still require access to large models during inference, limiting their practical advantages in resource-constrained environments. (iii) Self-supervised learning and pseudolabeling (Chen et al., 2013; Veit et al., 2017; Radosavovic et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2023) provide an alternative by leveraging unlabeled data to generate training signals. However, naïve pseudo-labeling often propagates noisy predictions, reducing overall effectiveness. Moreover, the challenge of systematically transferring knowledge from large to small vision-language models using pseudo-labeling remains largely under explored. Addressing this gap is crucial for making smaller models more capable without the high computational cost of large models for inference. To fill the aforementioned gaps, we introduce the Model Parity Aligner (MPA) framework that enables effective knowledge transfer from LVLM to S-VLM using only unlabeled images. Instead of relying on traditional knowledge distillation or fine-tuning, MPA utilizes large modelguided pseudo-labeling with quality assessment. MPA accurately identifies and addresses the knowledge gaps between S-VLM and L-VLM, ensuring that small models learn from high-confidence predictions while minimizing error propagation. By leveraging the strong reasoning capabilities of large VLMs to create high-quality supervision signals through systematic parity assessment, MPA efficiently addresses performance gaps while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the MPA. Specifically, we used four public datasets TextVQA (Singh et al., 2019), ST-VQA (Biten et al., 2019), ChartQA (Masry et al., 2022), and OKVQA (Marino et al., 2019). These datasets require additional capabilities such as visual text understanding, chart interpretation, and world knowledge integration, making them well-suited to test the robustness of MPA. We experimented with ten combinations of L-VLM and S-VLM pairs, demonstrating that MPA consistently improves S-VLM performance across all benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in knowledge transfer. Contributions: (i) We propose Model Parity Aligner (MPA) an effective approach that empowers small VLMs and improve their visual questionanswering performance using only unlabeled images, eliminating the need for expensive labeled datasets. (ii) MPA employs novel parity-based training paradigm, leveraging the L-VLM to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled images while identifying and targeting specific knowledge gaps between S-VLM and L-VLM. This strategy ensures reliable supervision, minimizes noise, and maximizes relevant knowledge transfer. (iii) MPA achieves consistent improvement across four diverse VQA benchmarks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that MPA not only improves VQA performance, but also enables S-VLM to benefit from closedsource L-VLMs and enhances its core capabilities beyond VQA, such as text recognition and textaware captioning."

            "content": "Small and Large VLMs: Following the success of large language models (LLMs) (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Penedo et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024) across NLP tasks, vision and language models (VLMs) (Liu et al., 2024; Dai et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Marafioti, 2024) have been developed that process both visual and textual data. Although state-of-the-art VLMs achieve impressive zero-shot performance, their growing parameter count impose significant constraints on computational efficiency, accessibility, and deployment costs. This trade-off between efficiency and capacity requires the development of smaller VLMs (Zhou et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Marafioti, 2024) that maintain competitive performance with reduced computational demands (Lu et al., 2024). The key approach to developing SVLMs from L-VLMs involves substituting the internal LLM with lightweight alternatives (Team et al., 2024; Abdin et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; HuggingFaceTB, 2023). Inspired by the literature on LLM (Lu et al., 2024), we follow parameterbased taxonomy where VLMs with 5B parameters are classified as S-VLMs, while those that exceed this threshold are L-VLMs. For context, small 4B-parameter VLM constitutes just 0.2% of the estimated 1.8T parameters of GPT-4. Knowledge Distillation: It transfers knowledge from large teacher models to smaller student models using KL-divergence over soft logits (Hinton et al., 2015) or feature representations (Wang et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2019). With LLMs adhering to scaling laws, their distillation has gained significant interest. Recent methods for LLMs (Gu et al., 2024; Ko et al., 2024) and L-VLMs (Shu et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024) explore KL-Divergence variants, while others (Hsieh et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2024; Ranaldi and Freitas, 2024) distill reasoning via LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought rationales. In contrast to standard KD, which distills over the labeled dataset, our method identifies and supervises only the samples that represent knowledge gaps between the student and teacher. This targeted strategy enables efficient, model-agnostic training using only input-output access to the teacherincluding closed-source L-VLMs. Data Augmentation for VQA: Vision and language tasks such as VQA have traditionally been benefited by data augmentation, and visual question generation becomes natural choice to generate augmented data (Fan et al., 2018; Jain et al., 2017; Krishna et al., 2019; Mostafazadeh et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2022; Jahagirdar et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2017; Vedd et al., 2022). Although few methods (Chen et al., 2022; Kant et al., 2021; Kil et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2023) augment the data-scarce VQA datasets to improve performance, other methods (Banerjee et al., 2021; Changpinyo et al., 2022) leverage large-scale image-caption datasets to generate noisy VQA labels and use them as VQA foundational data. Distinctively different from these lines of work, we employ L-VLMs to pseudo-label unlabeled images with quality check to discard noise, ensuring minimal yet effective annotations for targeted improvements of S-VLMs."

WRR: word recognition rate. achieves notable +15.2% gain on ChartQA, highlighting our MPAs strength as knowledge alignment module. In this scenario, it effectively identifies and bridges the knowledge gap between LVLM and S-VLM for complex visual reasoning that involves interpreting charts and graphs. Improvements on TextVQA (+6.4%) and ST-VQA (+5.1%) further demonstrate MPAs ability to transfer visual text understanding from larger to smaller models. The modest gain on OKVQA reflects its reliance on external knowledge, which S-VLM inherently lack. While MPA enhances internal knowledge utilization, it cannot fully address such gaps without RAG or fine-tuning on knowledge-rich data. The results validate the effectiveness of MPA within its scope, while highlighting the challenges of knowledge-intensive visual question answering. (iii) Model size-specific Analysis: MPA improves performance on all model scales, from SmolVLM500M to InternVL2-4B, demonstrating its versatility. In particular, TinyLLaVA-2B achieves the highest average gain of +6.8 across all tasks, whereas InternVL2-4B shows comparatively modest improvement of +2.1. We attribute this contrast to two factors: (i) Pretraining data gaps: smaller models like TinyLLaVA-2B benefit more from MPA as it effectively fills missing capabilities through targeted alignment; (ii) Diminishing returns with scale: it is inherently harder to align larger models (4B in this case) that already possess stronger capabilities, in line with scaling laws. (iv) L-VLM-Specific Analysis: We analyze the effectiveness of different guiding L-VLMs within MPA by computing average gains across five SVLMs and four VQA datasets. Qwen2VL-7B achieves the highest average improvement of +3.5 points, followed closely by InternVL2-8B with +3.2 points. This suggests that while both models are effective guides, Qwen2VL-7B offers slightly stronger alignment signal, potentially due to differences in their pretraining objectives or representations. These results highlight that MPA is robust to the choice of L-VLM, yet benefits from stronger or L-VLM Qwen2VL-7B InternVL2-8B Status AC TR HLS Pre-PI 0.76 0.68 Post-PI 0.92 0.84 Pre-PI 0.74 0.65 Post-PI 0.87 0.78 0.8 0.92 0.78 0.88 58 74 56 73 Table 4: User study on the pseudo-annotations quality: Pre-PI and Post-PI in MPA.

            "title": "4.1.1 Ablations and Analysis",
            "content": "We conduct the following ablations and analysis: (i) How effective is MPA in aligning S-VLMs with closed-source models?: MPA can also leverage powerful closed-source L-VLMs to improve S-VLMs. To assess this, we performed experiments using GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024) as the guiding LVLM. As shown in Table 2, MPA consistently improves performance across all aligned S-VLMs, despite having no access to the guiding models logits or weights. This demonstrates MPAs unique advantage over standard distillation methods, which require full model access. With the expected rise in powerful closed-source models (OpenAI, 2024; Team et al., 2023), such alignment strategies become increasingly valuable. In fact, our results show that integrating powerful L-VLM, e.g. GPT4o through MPA brings S-VLMs closer or even better in performance to significantly larger models, e.g., MPA-aligned Qwen2VL-2B (75.4%) outperforms Qwen2VL-7B (74.7%). (ii) Does MPA transfers the fundamental capabilities beyond VQA?: MPA is designed to enhance the VQA performance of S-VLMs by aligning them with L-VLMs, and our results confirm its effectiveness. To examine whether MPA also transfers broader fundamental capabilities such as visual text understanding, we evaluate zero-shot TinyLLaVA2B and its MPA-aligned counterpart on two different tasks: visual text recognition on ICDAR 2015 (Karatzas et al., 2015) and text-aware image captioning on TextCaps (Sidorov et al., 2020), using Qwen2VL-7B as the guiding L-VLM in MPA. As shown in Table 3, the MPA-aligned model improved text recognition accuracy by 4.5% on an absolute scale and yields notable improvements in captioning metrics such as ROUGE-L and CIDEr. These results suggest that MPA transfers fundamental text understanding capabilities from L-VLMs to S-VLMs beyond the VQA.

Please note that MPA operates without any humanlabeled samples, whereas the other two baselines each use 100 human-labeled samples. annotation quality correction?: Incorrect annotations may cause models to learn spurious patterns, exhibit biased behavior, and suffer from degraded performance and reliability in downstream tasks. To assess the impact of the PI module on genereted annotation quality, we conducted user study in which three annotators evaluated 500 randomly sampled pseudo-annotations prior and post PI processing. The evaluation used the following metrics: (a) Answerability (A): 1 if the question is answerable from the image, 0 otherwise; (b) Answer Correctness (AC): 1 if the answer is correct, assuming the question is valid; (c) Task Relevance (TR): 1 if the question aligns with the task, 0 otherwise; and (d) Human-Likeness Score (HLS): percentage of PI-sampled annotations mistaken for human-annotated ones in mixed set. As shown in Table 4, post-PI annotations exhibited higher quality across all metrics, with more being identified as human-annotated. Figure 3 provides visual evidence by illustrating the high correlation between MPA-generated annotations and human annotated samples. These results validate that PI effectively filters noise and corrects errors, enhancing the overall reliability of MPA-generated annotations. (iv) How does MPA compare to few-shot supervised baselines? While MPA is designed for setting where human-labeled traning data is unavailable, obtaining small labeled set (e.g., 100 samples) is often feasible. In such scenarios, commonly adopted few-shot supervised methods like LoRAbased SFT and full SFT can be applied directly to the S-VLM. To benchmark MPA against these methods, we fine-tune Qwen2VL-2B using both approaches and compare them with MPA-aligned Qwen2VL-2B (using Qwen2VL-7B as L-VLM). As shown in Table 5, MPA consistently outperforms both baselines without labeled supervision, demonstrating high-quality label generation and effective knowledge transfer. (v) Does PI filtering improve over raw pseudolabels or full human-labeled data?

MPA-aligned TinyLLaVA-2B (with Qwen2VL-7B as L-VLM) shows improved cross-domain generalization. we further investigate the quality of supervision introduced by PI filtering. Specifically, we compare three settings for training Qwen2VL-2B: (i) full human-labeled data (HL), (ii) pseudo-labeled data (PL) from MPA without PI filtering, and (iii) highquality subset selected by PI that targets the knowledge gap. As shown in Table 6, the PI-selected subset achieves the highest accuracy across all tasksTextVQA (75.1%), ST-VQA (67.2%), and ChartQA (67.6%), despite using far fewer samples. Interestingly, the performance gain from full human-labeled data over zero-shot baselines is relatively limited. Prior work (Khan et al., 2023) suggests that excessive labeled data can introduce redundancy or noise, reducing the marginal benefit of supervision. This highlights the value of PI filtering in identifying high-utility samples that yield more efficient and effective learning. (vi) Beyond standard VQA applicability (Medical VQA): To evaluate MPAs utility beyond standard VQA tasks, we assess its performance in the medical domain using the PathVQA dataset (He et al., 2020). We compare zero-shot TinyLLaVA2B with its MPA-aligned counterpart, guided by Qwen2VL-7B. We focus on the binary (yes/no) subset of PathVQA, as the open-ended questions often contain highly specialized medical terminology that poses challenges even for large models and may not reflect generalizable reasoning capabilities. As shown in Table 7, MPA yields gain of +2.4%, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer even in diverse domain-specific settings. These results highlight MPAs ability to generalize across domains without requiring task-specific data or fine-tuning. (vii) Knowledge Gap Analysis. To better characterize the nature of the knowledge gaps between SVLMs and L-VLMs, we manually inspected 100 randomly selected DP samples per task. In particular, we compared Qwen2VL-2B and Qwen2VL7B within the MPA framework. We categorize the dataset-wise knowledge gaps into key categories, which are summarized in Table 8. Note that Correct but Verbose and Noisy/Task-Irrelevant cases are excluded from the knowledge-gap categories, as they do not represent fundamental reasoning shortcomings. Further, we provide representative examples that illustrate these knowledge-gap categories: 1. TextVQA/ST-VQA: (i) Shallow OCR grounding (Fig. 5 (a)): What word is printed under interior design on the book in the middle? S-VLM outputs para from nearby visible region instead of grounding to the queried location. (ii) Noisy or hallucinated OCR (Fig. 7 (d)): What companys logo is in the black box in the upper left? S-VLM hallucinates Burberry without actually reading the text. 2. ChartQA: (i) Entity misalignment (Fig. 8 (d)): Who was the leading goal scorer for Celtic FC as of September 2020? the S-VLM retrieves an incorrect player name that is not aligned with the queried entity. (ii) Conditional/chart understanding error (Fig. 5 (c)): Which year yielded the smallest difference between men and women students? S-VLM fails to detect the year with the minimum gap between the trend lines. (iii) Trend misinterpretation (Fig. 8 (b)): Does the life expectancy decrease over the years? S-VLM misinterprets the slope changes. 3. OKVQA (i) Lack of internal knowledge grounding (Fig. 9 (b)): At what speed does this animal run? S-VLM fails to answer, while the MPA-aligned model succeeds without external knowledge, highlighting the shallow grounding of the S-VLM. (ii) Visual guesswork (Fig. 9 (c)): What is the name of the floor pattern? S-VLM guesses diamond from vague cues instead of leveraging the consistent checkered pattern."

Unlike traditional knowledge distillation techniques that rely on labeled data and access to large model logits, MPA employs pseudolabeling with quality assessment, ensuring that small models learn from high-confidence supervision while avoiding error propagation. Our experiments across four diverse VQA benchmarks, viz. TextVQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA and OKVQA demonstrate that MPA consistently improves SVLM performance, making them more viable for real-world applications with limited resources. Despite these improvements, there still remains gap between S-VLMs and L-VLMs that highlights the need for further advancements. As future work, we aim to explore more robust knowledge alignment strategies, including iterative refinement of pseudo-labels, leveraging diverse sources of unlabeled data, and integrating multi-step reasoning from L-VLMs into S-VLMs training. Additionally, extending MPA to tasks beyond visual question answering could further enhance its applicability. We view MPA as first step toward achieving model parity in vision and language models via targeted knowledge alignment, and firmly believe that it shall open up future research avenues for more efficient and capable small models for vision-language tasks."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Our proposed MPA framework depends on access to large vision-language model (L-VLM) for generating and validating pseudo-annotations. In even stricter resource-constrained settings, this may limit applicability of MPA. Further, when leveraging proprietary closed-source models via commercial APIs, reproducibility and transparency may be compromised due to limited insight into model behavior and potential changes in API responses over time. Our experiments also focus primarily on English-language datasets and VQA-related tasks; generalization to multilingual, or more complex reasoning tasks remains an open direction."

            "title": "Ethical Considerations and Broader\nImpact",
            "content": "In this work, we used open-source datasets which may contain social or cultural biases. The proposed framework also depends on outputs from largescale vision-language models (L-VLMs), which are known to occasionally generate hallucinated or biased content. Although the Parity Identifier (PI) module is designed to filter out low-quality or incorrect annotations, it cannot entirely eliminate inherited biases from the underlying L-VLM. Further, this work involves human evaluation study in which three annotators were employed to assess the quality of pseudo-annotations generated by our MPA framework. All annotators were compensated fairly in accordance with local wage norms. They were not exposed to harmful, offensive, or sensitive content, and no personally identifiable information was collected at any stage of the study. Broader Impact: The proposed MPA framework enables efficient training of small vision-language models (S-VLMs) using only unlabeled data, reducing reliance on expensive human annotations. By transferring capabilities from large vision-language models (L-VLMs) to compact models, MPA makes high-performing multimodal systems more accessible in low-resource settings. This democratization of vision-language technology can benefit realworld applications in healthcare, agriculture, and accessibility, particularly in regions with limited compute or labeled data. Furthermore, the proposed approach encourages the development of scalable alignment strategies that can generalize to diverse, resource-constrained communities."

            "content": "(i) Additional comparisons: utility of PI filtering over raw pseudo-labels. We extend the analysis of PI filtering by reporting the results of MPA (w/o PI) across all S-VLMs with Qwen2VL-7B as the guiding L-VLM within MPA. As shown in Table 9, MPA consistently outperforms MPA (w/o PI) across all tasks and S-VLMs, despite using far fewer training samples (for instance, 2K vs. 21K for TextVQA). These results reinforce the utility of PI filtering in isolating knowledge-gap samples that provide more efficient and targeted supervision. (ii) Expanded comparison on OCR and text-aware captioning tasks. In Table 3, we examined whether MPA-trained models can improve fundamental capabilities such as OCR and text-aware image captioning, even without direct supervision. We further evaluate this setting by comparing against models fine-tuned on the original human-labeled training splits of TextVQA; the results are presented in Table 10. As shown, MPA not only improves over the zero-shot baseline but also surpasses models trained with human-labeled annotations. This highlights that the gains stem from the effectiveness of the MPA pipeline, rather than from overlap between benchmarks, and demonstrates that MPA successfully transfers core visual-linguistic capabilities in label-free manner. (iv) Computational and API cost of PA and PI: MPA is one-time pipeline where each image is processed by the L-VLM during the PA phase, and each generated (image, question) pair is passed once through the L-VLM and S-VLM during the PI phase. For open-source L-VLMs like Qwen2VL-7B deployed locally, this is computationally lightweight: on machine with 3 A6000 (48GB) GPUs, generating approximately 21K pseudo-annotations (e.g., for TextVQA) takes around 4-6 hours end-to-end. Further, the PI step takes another 2-3 hours to identify the samples that represent the knowledge gaps. Alternatively, while using GPT-4o via API, we estimate the total cost of PA + PI for single S-VLMtask pair to be around $11, making MPA highly cost-effective label-free alternative to supervised training.

Majority of the chosen S-VLMs and L-VLMs employed in our propsed method MPA, we use their original code-base repositories and/or their Huggingface implementations depending on the ease of reproducibility. Parity leveler (Section 3.3) module trains the entire S-VLM on the samples obtained from the PI module (Section 3.2) for one epoch, for all the benchmark datasets. Hyperparameters used by the PL module for different S-VLMs are summarized in Table 11. All our experiments are conducted on machine with three Nvidia A6000 GPUs (48 GB each). For every L-VLM and S-VLM combination, it took approximately, 5-12 GPU hours for entire MPA, for one dataset. We use gpt-4o-2024-11-20 (OpenAI, 2024) for our closed-source L-VLM ablation."
