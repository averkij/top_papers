Introduction Recent diffusion models [5, 32, 46, 50, 68] achieve high-fidelity image and video synthesis, and multimodal assistants [2, 9, 47, 84] show that unified perception across text and vision is feasible. Yet, visual generation pipelines in practice remain fragmented: text-to-image [25, 42], text-to-video [1, 13, 72], and visual editing models [37, 49, 73] are developed and deployed separately, while multimodal LLMs offer unified perception but still rely on external diffusion backbones or decoders for high-resolution visual generation [16, 59]. This motivates the goal of building unified visual generation framework. Building such unified generator, however, poses two fundamental challenges. First, generation tasks often rely on rich, descriptive captions [11], whereas editing tasks use short, imperative instructions that modify localized regions or attributes. Second, when text, images, videos, and other guidance signals are provided simultaneously, current models lack mechanisms to reliably disentangle and prioritize multimodal signals, resulting in semantic conflicts or inconsistent conditioning effects. These challenges suggest that unified generator should process multimodal cues jointly and reason about their interactions. To address these limitations, we propose VINO, unified visual generator that performs interleaved generation and editing across both images and videos. VINO couples visionlanguage model (VLM) with Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where the VLM processes all control signals (text, reference images and video) and exposes them as unified conditioning tokens, while the MMDiT operates as token-based diffusion backbone over latent images and videos. This formulation enables single diffusion backbone to accommodate multimodal control sources without task-specific modules. Beyond unifying control signals, we introduce two architectural components: first, key component is the use of learnable query tokens at the VLM input. Inspired by recent work [59], these learnable tokens provide flexible interface between high-level instructions and low-level diffusion features and are jointly optimized with the generator. We integrate the learnable tokens processed by the VLM together with tokens from all modalities into the MMDiT. Empirically, this formulation yields smoother optimization, improved stability, and stronger generation and editing quality. Second, to preserve detailed reference information, we not only use the VLM-extracted features as conditioning signals, but also injects the corresponding VAE latents into the MMDiT [23, 44, 77]. Crucially, for each reference image or video, we reuse the same paired startend tokens that wrap its VLM tokens to additionally wrap its VAE latent tokens. In this way, both the semantic (VLM) and latent (VAE) representations of the same reference are associated with the same boundary markers, enabling the MMDiT to consistently recognize and group features originating from the same visual source. While the architecture provides unified conditioning, directly training such model remains challenging due to heterogeneous instruction formats. First, we utilize image and video data with long captions to align the output space of the VLM with the condition space of MMDiT. To adapt the model to short captions and prompt the learnable tokens to acquire the ability to refine short captions, we introduce mixed training phase that incorporates both long and short captions. After the model has adapted to both long and short captions, we proceed to train its multi-task capabilities. We evaluate VINO across diverse image and video generation and editing tasks, including textto-image, text-to-video, instruction-based image editing, reference-driven video generation, and instruction-based video editing. Empirically, VINO delivers strong visual quality, improved identity preservation and faithful instruction following across both images and videos, providing more scalable path toward unified visual generation than existing task-specific diffusion pipelines. In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: 1. We present VINO, unified diffusion-based architecture that handles both image and video generation and editing within single framework by coupling VLM with MMDiT. 2. We incorporate learnable query tokens into the VLMs input and provide an empirical study demonstrating that they improve multimodal conditioning, stabilize optimization. 3. We propose token-boundary mechanism that reuses special VLM tokens within the MMDiTs VAE latent stream to maintain consistent grounding across semantic and latent representations of reference images and videos. This reduces identity swapping and attribute leakage in complex, multimodal reference scenes. 4 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context 4. We introduce progressive training strategy that upgrades pretrained video model into multi-task visual generator while preserving its original visual generation strength. Figure 3 Overview of the VINO pipeline. Our unified framework conditions generation on an interleaved omnimodal context that jointly encodes system prompts, prompts/instructions, reference images/videos, and learnable tokens. frozen VLM processes textual instructions together with visual references, producing multimodal embeddings that are augmented with learnable tokens (purple) and separated by special tokens (vision start token ). These interleaved multimodal representations are fed into the MMDiT blocks, which also receive VAE latents from the reference images or video. The MMDiT model performs denoising conditioned on the full multimodal context, enabling VINO to execute image and video generation as well as instruction-based editing within single unified architecture. and vision end token 2. Methods In this section, we present our unified framework for multi-modal image and video generation/editing. Our objective is to design system that accepts heterogeneous control signalstextual instructions, reference images or videos, and learnable tokensand uses them to guide diffusion-based visual generator. Following the high-level model pipeline (Figure. 3), we structure this section around three central components. We first describe how multi-modal conditions are processed by the visionlanguage model (VLM) to obtain coherent feature representations in Section 2.1. We then explain how these encoded conditions are injected into the Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) without causing ambiguity or incorrect cross-modal grounding in Section 2.2. Finally, we detail the training strategy that makes the entire architecture unified, multi-task visual generator capable of supporting wide spectrum of editing and generation tasks in Section 2.3. 2.1. Multi-Modal Conditions To handle diverse forms of input, we employ frozen VLM model as the front-end encoder for all language and visual conditions. As illustrated in the Figure 4, the system prompt varies with the presence and number of input modalities. When no visual modality is provided, the user supplies only text input, which serves as the sole condition for text-to-image or text-to-video generation. When visual inputs are present, they are first sorted by type (image, then video) and placed at the beginning of the prompt, each assigned unique identifier such as Image 1 or Video 1. The user can then reference these identifiers in the text input to specify different visual conditions, enabling complex multimodal control. In addition, we append set of learnable tokens at the end of the prompt to 5 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context System Prompt for Tasks Conditioned on Text <im_start>system You are helpful assistant aimed at generating an output video caption. <im_end> <im_start>user <user_text> <im_end> <im_start>assistant System Prompt for Tasks Conditioned on Visual Modalities and Instruction <im_start>system You are helpful assistant aimed at generating an output video caption. <im_end> <im_start>user Image 1: <user_image_1> Image n: <user_image_n> Video 1: <user_video> <user_text> <im_end> <im_start>assistant Figure 4 System prompt for different condition task, where <user_text>, <user_image> and <user_video> denote the user-provided input conditions across different modalities. For brevity, we omit the <vision_start> and <vision_end> tokens for the visual modalities. Figure 5 3D RoPE strategy for the VAE branch in VINO. We apply unified 3D RoPE schedule along the temporal axis to interleave different visual modalities in the MMDiT VAE branch. Each modalitysingle reference images, multi-frame reference videos, and noisy target latentsis placed on shared RoPE timeline, separated by special tokens, which are projected from the VLM output. This structured RoPE layout enables the model to distinguish heterogeneous visual sources. extract cross-modal features into shared space. These tokens are also handled using causal masking rather than granting full bidirectional attention [59]. Finally, we use the penultimate layer hidden states of the VLM as the encoded conditioning, apply two-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for feature projection, and then feed them into the subsequent MMDiT. 2.2. Interleaved OmniModal Context Although the VLM provides robust high-level multimodal semantics, it significantly compresses visual information, resulting in lack of fine-grained spatial details and texture fidelity. Consequently, it cannot adequately handle tasks requiring precise structural control, such as local editing. To compensate for this information bottleneck, we complement the VLM embeddings with VAE-encoded latents of all visual modalities. As illustrated in the Figure 5, these VAE latents are arranged following the same ordering used in the VLM, and place the noised image/video latents at the end. However, simply concatenating image and video latents introduces ambiguity. To uniquely distinguish different visual conditions and to align each VAE latent with its corresponding VLM feature, we reuse the VLMs <vision_start> and <vision_end> embeddings. After projecting these embeddings through an MLP to match the MMDiT input dimension, they are used to mark the boundaries of each visual latent block. This explicit boundary marking serves as strong positional cue, allowing the attention mechanism to correctly effectively distinguish and interpret distinct visual conditioning inputs within 6 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context the sequence. 2.3. Training the Unified Multi-Task Visual Generator Figure 6 Training data distribution across the stages. This progressive strategy gradually transforms the base model from pure text-to-video generator into capable multi-task visual generator. To build unified visual generator that supports multimodal conditioning, we start from textto-video diffusion model, as it already provides strong priors for temporal dynamics. To replace the original text encoder, we first align the output space of VLM with the models native text encoder. In this initial stage, only two-layer MLP connector is trained to map between the two embedding spaces. Modern text-to-video models typically rely on long, well-structured textual prompts, whereas editing tasks often involve short instructions, creating distributional gap. To bridge this gap, we adopt progressive training strategy that gradually shifts the input-condition distribution. Specifically, we treat short prompts as an intermediate form between long prompts and concise editing instructions. In the second stage, we train the model with mixture of long and short prompts to ensure robustness across both forms, and we begin updating the MMDiT parameters during this stage. Once the model has adapted to short-prompt inputs, we enter the final stage, where full multi-task mixed training is performed. The data mixture ratio for each stage is illustrated in the Figure 6. This allows the model to smoothly transition from structured text-to-video conditioning to instruction-based multimodal generation and editing. 3. Experiments In this section, we present experimental results demonstrating VINOs performance across variety of visual generation and editing tasks. We compare against several advanced baselines, including both open-source and close-source systems. Notably, most competing methods remain proprietary and do not offer unified generator comparable to VINO. Additional visualizations are available on our project webpage. 3.1. Implement Details Datasets Composition. As illustrated in Figure 6, our training pipeline allows for progressive capability acquisition, organized into multiple stages where each targets distinct subset of tasks. To support this staged paradigm, we curate comprehensive mixture of datasets, combining large-scale open-source image/video collections [7, 8, 16, 19, 38, 55, 58, 61, 66, 79, 81, 88] and high-quality distillation data from open-source models [18, 21, 37, 69, 86], ensuring broad coverage across visual generation and visual editing. To handle this diverse data efficiently, we implement dynamic resolution bucketing strategy. Instead of resizing all inputs to fixed square resolution, we dynamically rescale images and videos based on their original dimensions. Specifically, within each training stage, we ensure that all samples have similar effective areas (i.e., total pixel count) while preserving their original aspect ratios. This strategy maintains balanced computational load across GPUs at every 7 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context Table 1 Training hyperparameters and trainable modules for the three-stage progressive training pipeline.

Base Models. Regarding the architecture, we integrate strong pre-trained priors to accelerate convergence. We adopt Qwen3VL-4B-Instruction [9], one of the most recent and advanced visionlanguage models, as our multimodal encoder to provide strong understanding capabilities. For the visual generator, we initialize our model with HunyuanVideo [40], an advanced text-to-video backbone. As shown in Table 2, compared to other open-source baselines, HunyuanVideo demonstrates better prompt adherence, producing visually coherent outputs even with concise or minimal textual descriptions, making it an ideal foundation for our instruction-driven generation tasks. Training details. Table 1 provides comprehensive overview of the hyperparameters employed across our three-stage training pipeline. This progressive curriculum is engineered to incrementally expand the models capabilities while ensuring stability and efficient optimization. For all stages, we train using DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 [62], which reduces memory consumption and enables training large modules efficiently. We further apply gradient checkpointing to the MMDiT backbone to reduce activation memory during video-heavy tasks. To ensure that each GPU can sustain local batch size of 1, we dynamically adjust the number of video frames and number of reference images depending on the task. Since different tasks have different computational costs, we enforce strict task synchronization across all GPUs at each step, preventing workload imbalance and ensuring optimal training throughput. 3.2. Visual Generation We initiate our quantitative evaluation by assessing foundational Text-to-Image (T2I) and Textto-Video (T2V) capabilities using Geneval [30] and VBench [34]. These benchmarks assess core visual generation abilities including object composition, color fidelity, semantic alignment, visual quality, and temporal dynamics. primary concern in instruction tuning is catastrophic forgetting, where new tasks degrade original performance. However, despite Stage 3 allocating only minor fraction of the data budget to standard T2I/T2V samples, VINO retains performance metrics highly comparable to the HunyuanVideo backbone. This empirical evidence confirms that our training strategy effectively mitigates model degradation, preserving the strong pre-trained generative priors while accommodating multimodal customization tasks. 8 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context Table 2 Geneval [30] results comparing VINO with image and video models. Compared with its base model [40], VINO maintains strong text-to-image ability using only small proportion of T2I samples in Stage 3. refer to the methods using LLM rewriter [23].

Given the same input video and editing instructions, VINO delivers markedly stronger instruction following and better visual quality. We subsequently evaluate VINO on OpenS2V [81], benchmark specifically designed for subjectdriven, reference-based video generationa capability widely absent in standard T2V models. Here, VINO demonstrates clear advantages over its base model. As shown in Table 4, the model demonstrates well-balanced performance, indicating that VINO effectively internalizes the customized, referencealigned generation abilities introduced during later training stages. Collectively, these results verify that VINO successfully safeguards the robust open-domain capabilities of HunyuanVideo, while substantially expanding the system toward multimodal, reference-guided, and instruction-driven customization. This validates the effectiveness of our unified framework in handling hybrid conditioning without architectural conflict. 3.3. Visual Editing We assess the visual editing capabilities of VINO across both spatial (image) and spatio-temporal (video) domains. Image editing. For image editing, we adopt two comprehensive benchmarks: ImgEdit [80] and GEdit [49], which jointly cover broad range of editing skills including adjustment, removal, replacement, addition, composition and style change. Since our base model lacks text-rendering ability, we exclude the text-change subtask in GEdit. Even though HunyuanVideo has no inherent editing capability, our progressive training strategy successfully equips VINO with strong instruction-following behavior. Notably, when we evaluate the model after only 1𝑘 training steps in Stage 3, where editing 9 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context Table 3 VBench [34] results across closed-source and open-source video models. VINO retains strong text-to-video generation capability, achieving performance comparable to its base model [40]. Moreover, VINOwhich uses stronger VLM as the conditioning encodershows clear improvements in semantic score. These results demonstrate that our unified framework not only preserves the generative strengths of the base model but also benefits from enhanced multimodal conditioning through stronger VLMs. refer to the methods using LLM rewriter [33].

This rapid improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of our unified architecture and training strategy in enabling fast adaptation and efficient skill transfer from generation tasks to editing tasks. Video editing. To assess video editing, we compare VINO against VACE-Ditto [8, 37], variant of VACE equipped with instruction-following capability through Dittos fine-tuning (the original VACE does not support instruction-based editing). Following the Ditto evaluation protocol, we use their curated mini video editing test set1 and generate diverse editing instructions using GPT-5. We selected metrics from Vbench [34] for video quality to conduct quantitative evaluation on videos edited by different models. Quantitative results in Table 7 and qualitative results in Figure 7 show that VINO demonstrates better instruction comprehension capability and enhanced generative performance. Beyond these, we also conduct user study, where participants prefer VINO in terms of instruction adherence and edited-video quality. Together, these results demonstrate that through unified modeling design and progressive training pipeline, VINO achieves advanced visual editing capability across both images and videos, offering strong generalization, precise instruction following, and high-quality multimodal editing 1https://huggingface.co/datasets/QingyanBai/Ditto-1M/tree/main/mini_test_videos 10 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context Table 5 Image editing results on the ImgEdit [80] benchmark. Despite receiving editing supervision only in stage 3, VINO acquires image-editing capability extremely quickly: after just 1k training steps in stage 3, the model already surpasses most open-source baselines. With full stage 3 training, VINO further improves, demonstrating the effectiveness of our progressive training strategy.

Ablation Study We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate and validate the contributions of three pivotal components in our framework: (1) the integration of learnable tokens for robust multimodal alignment, (2) the impact of image classifier-free guidance (Image CFG) on inference dynamics, and (3) the special token inserted between VAE latents to disentangle heterogeneous latent sequences. Learnable tokens. As shown in Figure 8, introducing learnable tokens leads to substantially more stable training process, characterized by smoother and more well-behaved optimization curves across all tasks (T2V, T2I, I2V, and reconstruction). In contrast, removing these tokens results in noticeably noisier gradients and less stable convergence behavior. Beyond stability, learnable tokens also enhance multimodal conditioning fidelity and semantic precision. As illustrated in Figure 9, the model equipped with learnable tokens performs more accurate object removal and replacement, demonstrating that these tokens are essential for effectively incorporating multimodal conditions, directly translating into better performance in complex generation and editing tasks. 11 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context Table 7 Quantitative evaluation of video editing quality. We compare VINO with VACE-Ditto using video-quality metrics in VBench [34]. In addition, we conduct user study assessing instruction following and perceived video quality.

Training curves comparing models with (purple) and without (blue) learnable tokens across tasks (T2V, T2I, I2V, and image reconstruction). Introducing learnable tokens substantially stabilizes optimization, yielding lower gradient variance, reduced gradient norms, and smoother, healthier loss trajectories. This demonstrates that learnable tokens provide more reliable multimodal conditioning and facilitate more stable convergence during unified visual generation training. The guidance of the reference images. We investigate the role of Image CFG as control knob for the fidelity-motion trade-off in reference-guided generation. Increasing the Image CFG scale significantly reinforces visual adherence, ensuring that the generated results strictly preserves the identity and content of the reference image (Figure 10). However, we observe diminishing return: excessively high guidance scales constrain the generative process, suppressing the models inherent motion priors and causing the output to degenerate into static, frozen sequences. Consequently, moderate image CFG is essential to strike the optimal balance, maintaining high identity fidelity while allowing for natural temporal dynamics. Special Token Between Latents. Finally, we analyze the use of special token to disentangle VAE latents from different modalities and different lengths. Simply concatenating VAE latents from static images and dynamic videos introduces ambiguity, leading the attention mechanism to erroneously interpret the static reference latents as part of the temporal video sequence. This misalignment manifests as severe artifacts, particularly structural distortions in the initial frames, as shown in the bottom row of Figure 11. Furthermore, this explicit separation ensures generalization robustness, allowing the model to handle variable-length inputs during inference without overfitting to specific training sequence patterns. Together, these ablations confirm that these components are not redundant but foundational: they collectively ensure optimization stability, precise controllability, and effective modality disentanglement in multimodal generation. 12 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context Figure 9 Ablation on learnable tokens for image editing. Visual comparison of editing results with and without learnable tokens under multimodal conditioning. When provided with both the input image and an instruction, the model equipped with learnable tokens produces edits that more faithfully follow the instruction while preserving scene structure and appearance. In contrast, the model without learnable tokens often misinterprets the editing intent or generates semantically inconsistent content. 4. Related Works Recent advancements in visual generation have coalesced into dynamic landscape characterized by three pivotal trends. First, Diffusion Probabilistic Models have emerged as the de facto paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis and editing, providing the fundamental generative backbone with versatile conditioning interfaces (Section 4.1). Concurrently, mirroring the unification seen in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is paradigm shift towards Unified and Omni-Visual Generators, where disparate tasks and modalities are consolidated into single, versatile frameworks (Section 4.2). Complementing these structural evolutions, the maturation of VisionLanguage Models (VLMs) has revolutionized generative control, enabling systems to leverage rich semantic understanding for precise guidance and evaluation (Section 4.3). Our work is situated at the intersection of these developments, leveraging their collective strengths to enable robust multimodal conditional generation. 4.1. Diffusion-Based Generation and Editing Diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity image [25, 42, 64, 76] and video [17, 40, 69, 78] synthesis from natural language prompts and become the de facto backbone for wide range of downstream editing methods. Instruction-based editing methods [12, 28] learn to follow free-form text instructions to modify an input image by training on synthetic paired data. Other lines of work focus on adding explicit spatial control signals: ControlNet [85] augments frozen text-to-image model with trainable conditional branches, enabling precise geometric or structural control while preserving the base models generation quality. Subsequent research explores training-free or inversion-based editing, using techniques like null-text inversion [57], iterative noising [29], or latent token manipulation [15] to reconstruct an input image in the diffusion latent space and then apply text-guided edits while maintaining identity and background. 4.2. Unified and Omni Visual Generation Inspired by how large language models unify diverse NLP tasks, recent work has started to pursue unified visual generators. Some works [39, 45, 74] propose diffusion models for unified image generation that support text-to-image, reference-guided generation, image editing, and other visualconditional tasks within single framework, largely through carefully designed conditioning space and multi-task training. On the video side, unified video frameworks [54] aim to jointly support video understanding, generation, and instruction-based editing, typically by sharing video 13 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context Figure 10 Qualitative comparison under different image-CFG scales. Increasing the image-CFG weight strengthens adherence to the visual identity provided by the reference images, yielding video frames that more closely match the subjects appearance and attributes. However, excessively large image-CFG values over-constrain the generative process, suppressing motion diversity and leading to noticeably reduced temporal dynamics. encoder/decoder while exposing different heads or objectives for various tasks. There are also works [37] on unified in-context video editing that attempt to handle multiple editing conditions in single model, often by conditioning on example clips or prompts and relying on generalized editing prior. recent survey on unified models for image understanding and generation further emphasizes the trend toward all-in-one models, but also points out that most current systems remain limited either to images or to narrow space of video tasks. 4.3. VisionLanguage Models for Editing and Generative Control As VLMs have rapidly advanced in perception, reasoning, and instruction following, recent work increasingly leverages them as controllers, teachers, or evaluators for diffusion-based editing. Datacentric approaches such as HQ-Edit [35] use GPT-4V [2] and DALLE 3 [11] to synthesize high-quality editing pairs and automatically score alignment and coherence, effectively turning VLMs into both dataset generators and supervisory signals. Model-centric methods [41, 87] integrate VLMs directly into the editing pipeline to provide more precise and localized edits or use as training reward. On the evaluation side, VLM-based metrics [35, 49] provide instruction-aware assessments by detecting what changed and whether the modifications adhere to user intent. Collectively, these works demonstrate growing trend in which VLMs play central role in instruction decomposition, semantic localization, supervision, and evaluation for controllable generative editing. 5. Conclusion We presented VINO, unified visual generator capable of performing both image and video generation and editing under single framework. By carefully designing the model components and conditioning pipeline that accepts interleaved omnimodal context, VINO can seamlessly integrate heterogeneous inputs and handle broad spectrum of visual tasks. Extensive comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness and strong performance of our approach. Moreover, our progressive training strategy enables the model to retain the generative strengths of its base video backbone while acquiring robust multitask capabilities, ultimately yielding coherent and unified visual generator. VINO offers flexible, scalable foundation for many-to-many visual generation and paves the way toward more general-purpose multimodal generative systems. Limitations and future works. Despite its versatility, VINO inherits several limitations. Our base model lacks text-rendering capability, which places VINO at disadvantage on benchmarks that explicitly evaluate text editing or text generation. 14 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context Figure 11 Ablation on the special token for separating VAE latents. Without special token (bottom row), the model incorrectly entangles the temporal structure of the input video with static image latents, causing noticeable artifactsmost prominently distorted structures in the first generated frame. Existing instruction-based editing datasets are generally of lower quality compared with largescale generation datasets. These editing samples often contain limited motion and simpler visual structures, which may bias the target distribution. Consequently, after incorporating instruction-edit tasks, the model may exhibit slightly reduced visual fidelity or motion richness compared with the original base generator. These limitations highlight the need for higherquality multimodal editing datasets and more balanced training strategies in future work. Within MMDiT the complexity of full attention grows quadratically. Therefore, supplying reference video together with large number of reference images, the inference latency increases substantially. This suggests that exploring more efficient visual generation backbones is promising direction. The modalities currently supported in VINO are ultimately constrained by the VLM. Although certain modalities can be converted into others (e.g., transforming audio into text, or using video to represent motion), our training pipeline only considers the most general modalitiesnamely text, image, and video. Exploring more powerful and more comprehensive VLMs constitutes promising direction for future research. 15 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context"

Omniworld: multi-domain and multi-modal dataset for 4d world modeling. arXiv preprint arXiv:2509.12201, 2025. 21 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context Appendix A. Base Models Qwen3-VL Qwen3-VL [9] is an advanced visionlanguage model belonging to the Qwen3 series. It extends large-language-model (LLM) capabilities into vision by integrating image and video encoders, enabling reasoning over diverse visual inputs and natural language instructions. This structure allows the model to build cross-modal attention without relying on handcrafted fusion modules, providing strong representational alignment across text and vision modalities. Given these properties, Qwen3-VL serves as our visualinstruction foundation: it provides cross-modal alignment, efficient visual tokenization, and empirically strong visual understanding and instruction-following capabilities, which are all essential for many-to-many reference-guided generation in our system. HunyuanVideo HunyuanVideo [40] is generative video model based on the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture [25], which leverages token-based sequence framework to effectively model video generation. The MMDiT excels at learning multimodal conditioning, using full attention to directly integrate and condition both visual and multimodal inputs, enhancing the models ability to generate coherent and contextually aligned visual content. These characteristics closely match the requirements of many-to-many generation and editing in our unified setting. Consequently, HunyuanVideo offers suitable video base model, enabling our approach to inherit advanced motion dynamics, coherent cross-modal grounding, and more controllable visual conditioning within single diffusion framework. B. More Details Training details. For each task, we define separate dataloader. Before each training step, task is selected probabilistically, and this selection is broadcasted from rank 0 to synchronize the tasks across all GPUs. This approach prevents idle times on any specific GPU by ensuring that all GPUs process the same task in each step. We use the default vision preprocessing configuration from Qwen3-VL for all visual inputs, but we limit the total number of video frames fed into Qwen3-VL to maximum of 8 frames, with the default frame rate set to 1 FPS. During training, we randomly drop conditions [12, 31], with the drop probability for different modalities being the same but independent, set to 0.1 for each. Additionally, to maintain load balance, when the number of input images for task becomes too large, we ensure that all GPUs either drop the condition simultaneously or not at all, preventing significant discrepancy in the final token sequence lengths. Proxy tasks. To enhance the models performance, we introduce two proxy tasks during the training process. These tasks are designed to help the model better learn and understand visual representations and relationships. In the stage 1, we employ an image reconstruction proxy task. Specifically, we feed an image into the Vision-Language Model (VLM) while bypassing the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The model is trained to reconstruct the input image. This task helps the MMDiT model learn and align the visual features extracted by the VLM, strengthening the models ability to handle the correspondence between high-level semantics and low-level details. In the stage 2, we introduce an image selection proxy task. When multiple reference images are provided, we can refer to each image by its ID in the instruction. To help the model learn the relationship between image IDs and their corresponding visual content, this task involves randomly sampling 𝑘 images and prompting the model to reconstruct the 𝑖-th image. This allows the model to learn the correspondence between the image ID and the image itself, further improving its ability to handle dynamic image inputs and their relationships. Inference details. Our inference method is based on [12, 31]. For text-conditioned generation tasks, we use classifier-free guidance (cfg) value 𝑤𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 of 7, and for multimodal condition-controlled generation tasks, we set 𝑤𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 5 and 𝑤𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 = 1.5. HunyuanVideo natively supports cfg as an input parameter without the need for multiple inferences, but this requires additional post-training, which we did not adopt. 22 VInO: Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context C. Quantitative Results C.1. Visual Understanding In Table 8, we present the quantitative results related to the understanding capabilities of our model. While our approach primarily focuses on generation, it inherently incorporates components for understanding tasks. leveraging the strengths of our base VLM model, Although we did not train Qwen3-VL directly, we utilize it to evaluate various understanding-related metrics, which serves as an integral part of VINO. We report on several of these metrics to provide comprehensive view of the models performance in visual understanding. Table 8 Quantitative results on visual understanding benchmarks.

As training progresses, the model refines its understanding, capturing finer details and showing clear progress in handling different tasks. of training, the model begins by learning the correspondence between visuals and instructions. As training continues, it gradually improves and starts to capture more detailed features. Over time, the model becomes better at handling more complex details, showing clear progress as the training steps increase. In Figure, we demonstrate the role of the learnable token in the The effect of learnable tokens. final model. When we choose longer captions, the model allocates more attention to the text features that are related to high-level semantics, while the learnable token learns to represent more low-level details. This aligns with our initial design: the learnable token acts as more flexible interface for the VLM, optimized together with MMDiT, allowing the model to more effectively learn knowledge at different levels. However, when shorter captions are selected, the role of the learnable token becomes more pronounced.
