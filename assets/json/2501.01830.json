[ 1 0 3 8 1 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) has significantly increased the demand for effective safety alignment to mitigate the risks associated with their misuse. Although extensive safety tuning has enabled LLMs to demonstrate alignment with human values (Lee 1Chinese Information Processing Laboratory, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 2University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 3Ant Group. Correspondence to: Shuheng Zhou <shuheng.zsh@antgroup.com>, Yaojie Lu <luyaojie@iscas.ac.cn>. Figure 1: Comparison between previous red-teaming approaches and AUTO-RT. Previous works focused on identifying safety flaws of the target model under given attack strategies, whereas AUTO-RT directly explores systematic safety flaws in target models starting from searching strategies itself, enabling fully automated process. et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2024), these models, as inherently complex systems, still harbor numerous undiscovered vulnerabilities (Allspaw & Cook, 2010). Identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities is critical for ensuring the reliability and robustness of LLMs, particularly as they are increasingly deployed in sensitive applications. However, as LLMs evolve and their use cases diversify, progress in this area has become more resource-intensive and constrained by human expertise. The safety vulnerabilities are typically evaluated based on their severity (potential harm caused) and exploitability (ease of triggering) (Bishop & Bailey, 1996; Bozorgi et al., 2010; Bhatt et al., 2021). Manual identification of safety vulnerabilities has focused on uncovering those with high exploitability, such as well-known attacks like Grandmas spell and past-tense attack (Andriushchenko & Flammarion, 2024), which bypass safety constraints in aligned models through contextual frameworks. In contrast, automated vulnerability discovery referred to as automatic red-teaming tends to emphasize high-severity vulnerabilities. For instance, methods like CRT (Hong et al., 2024) and Diver-CT (Zhao et al., 2024) employ reinforcement learning to randomly generate semantically diverse attack prompts. Other methods, such as AutoDAN (Liu et al., 1 AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models 2024b), Rainbow-Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024) and PAIR (Chao et al., 2024), leverage predefined attack strategies targeting specific hazardous behaviors. For multi-target attacks, GCG-Multi (Zou et al., 2023) introduced optimized universal suffixes to attack multiple objectives. However, due to the poor readability of these suffixes, their practical exploitability is limited. To address these challenges, we propose AUTO-RT, novel framework for automatic strategic red-teaming that prioritizes the discovery of high-exploitability safety vulnerabilities while maintaining balance between severity and efficiency. Unlike traditional methods that depend on predefined toxic behaviors or fixed attack strategies, AUTO-RT autonomously discovers high-exploitability attack strategies from scratch. This removes the reliance on human intervention or predefined attack scopes, enabling the framework to uncover novel vulnerabilities. Operating in black-box setting, AUTO-RT requires only access to models textual outputs, making it highly adaptable to broad spectrum of LLMs without necessitating internal model access. Its compatibility with both white-box and black-box models, including large-scale LLMs, highlights its versatility. Furthermore, we design two algorithms to reduce exploration complexity and improve strategy optimization in AUTO-RT. First, to optimize resource utilization during the exploration process, AUTO-RT employs an earlytermination mechanism within Early-terminated Exploration framework. This mechanism dynamically assesses the progress of exploration, halting unproductive paths in real-time and redirecting resources toward more promising strategies. This approach enhances computational efficiency and improves the precision of vulnerability discovery. Second, to further enhance the efficiency of strategy exploration, AUTO-RT employs Progressive Reward Tracking mechanism that leverages novel metric, First Inverse Rate (FIR), to select degrade model to densify safety reward signals (Ng et al., 1999) from the target models outputs. This innovation accelerates convergence and improves exploration outcomes, enabling AUTO-RT to navigate the extensive search space of potential attack strategies effectively. Extensive evaluations on 16 white-box models and two 70B black-box models demonstrate that AUTO-RT achieves superior effectiveness, efficiency, and diversity in generating attack strategies, establishing new standard in automated red-teaming. In summary, the contributions are as follows: 1. We propose novel framework for automated strategy generation red-teaming, eliminating reliance on predefined attack patterns and manual intervention, enabling dynamic and scalable vulnerability discovery. 2. We introduce AUTO-RT, reinforcement learningbased red-teaming approach that automatically explores and optimizes jailbreak strategies. By leveraging early-terminated exploration and progressive reward tracking algorithms, this method significantly improves exploration efficiency, adaptability, and vulnerability detection performance, providing systematic and scalable solution for automated red-teaming. 3. Beyond red-teaming, our approach offers flexible and generalizable framework for automated vulnerability assessment and alignment optimization. It provides practical methodologies to improve automated prompt discovery and LLM alignment optimization, advancing the development of robust and adaptable language models. 1. Preliminary: Red-Teaming Aligned LLMs The goal of automatic red-teaming is to generate attack prompts using attack model AM to challenge target model TM. The success of this process is evaluated based on the harmfulness of the responses produced by TM when reacting to an attack prompt generated by AM tailored for various toxic behaviors . The harmfulness of the responses is quantified using safety evaluation function R(x, y). In addition, during the optimization process of AM, it is common practice to augment the optimization objective with some additional constraint terms (Achiam et al., 2017; Moskovitz et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024), such as those that encourage the attack generation to stay close to natural language, ensure that the target generation aligns with the attack goal, and promote diversity in the attack generation. These constraints can be collectively represented as fi(x, y, t) ci. Formally, teaming can be expressed as: the optimization objective of automatic redE [R (x, y)] , arg max AM where AM(t), TM(x), fi (x, y, t) ci s.t. (1) When performing red-teaming with focus on discovering high-exploitability vulnerabilities, which we called strategic red-teaming, the attack model can be further decomposed into two components: strategy generation model AMg responsible for generating attack strategies and strategy-based attack rephrasing model AMr which utilizes the generated strategies to produce specific attack prompts . This process can be represented as AMr(s, t), where AMg and , therefore, Equation 1 can be reformulated as: 2 AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models Figure 2: The framework of AUTO-RT, comprising two key components: 1) Early-terminated Exploration, which assesses the diversity of the generated strategies and the consistency of the rephrased prompt with the initial toxic behavior to determine the necessity of safety evaluation. If either constraint is unmet, the process immediately terminate, and penalty is applied; 2) Progressive Reward Tracking, which enhances the density of safety rewards by utilizing degrade model derived from the target model, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the exploration process. [R (x, y)] , s.t.fi (x, y, s, t) ci (2) arg max AMg AMr where AMg, AMr(s, t), TM(x), To address the constrained MDP problem (Altman, 1999) represented by Equation 2, previous works primarily employ the Lagrange multiplier method to solve the dual problem (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004; Bertsekas, 2014). 2. Auto Red-Teaming In this section, we present our framework for automatic strategic red-teaming: AUTO-RT. We incorporate early termination into the MDP framework to enable the attack model to focus on exploring high-severity vulnerabilities while promptly halting ineffective explorations. Additionally, we leverage the degraded target model to perform reward shaping on the original safety signals, providing denser feedback signals to enhance the efficiency of exploration and exploitation.. We illustrate the schematic of our proposed framework in Figure. 2. Problems RL algorithms are known to struggle when reward signals are sparse (Dulac-Arnold et al., 2019; Rengarajan et al., 2022). Our experiments also show that directly optimizing using Equation 2 requires extensive exploration to find effective attack prompts, and as the target models safety capabilities improve, finding effective attack prompts becomes increasingly difficult. We believe this issue is due 3 to the following two factors: i). As the target models safety alignment improves, feedback signals from extensive exploration are mostly classified as safe. This results in the safety reward component lacking effective optimization guidance over time, causing the model to shift its exploration focus to other constraint terms, thereby deviating from the objective of red teaming. ii). Compared to optimization targeting specific attack goal, the reward signal for strategic red-teaming is even sparser. Additionally, when attacking specific target, different attack prompts tend to have some correlation, whereas in strategic red-teaming, various attack strategies show low similarity. These factors require the model to have stronger exploration capabilities to achieve effective red-teaming results. Our Approach To address issue (i), we propose Early-terminated Exploration which integrates the earlyterminated Markov Decision Process (ET-MDP) framework (Sun et al., 2021) into the Constrained MDP problem formulation in Equation 2. This approach introduces designated checkpoints within the MDP to evaluate compliance with predefined constraints. If constraint is violated, the exploration process is immediately terminated, and penalty signal is relayed to the AM. Safety evaluations of the target models responses are conducted exclusively when all constraints are satisfied, only the corresponding safety signals are generated and returned, without further consideration of AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models the constraints satisfaction status. Thus, Equation 2 can be reformulated as follows: (s) (cid:34) R (x, y) (cid:89) 1 (fi (x, y, s, t) ci) arg max AMg AMr (cid:88) + (fi, ci) 1 (fi (x, y, s, t) > ci) (3) (cid:35) where AMg, AMr(s, t), TM(x), where C(fi, ci) denotes the magnitude of the penalty signal to be fed back when the constraint fi is violated. Theoretically, Constrained MDP problems can be efficiently addressed using their early-terminated counterparts (Sun et al., 2021). When C(fi, ci) is sufficiently small (a condition that is straightforward to implement in practice) the optimal policy of the ET-MDP aligns with the optimal policy of the original Constrained MDP. To address issue (ii), we propose Progressive Reward Tracking mechanism which leveraging degraded model to enhance exploration in the red-teaming process, the principle is illustrated in Figure 3. Specifically, the target model is downgrade with toxic data to weaken its safety capabilities, resulting in degraded intermediate model TM . By incorporating the safety evaluation of the degraded models responses to attack prompts alongside the safety evaluation of the target models responses into combined safety feedback reward, we mitigate the sparsity of the feedback signal. The formal definition of the shaped safety feedback reward Rsis as follows: Rs = RTM (x, y) + RTM(x, y) where RTM(x, y) denotes the safety evaluation outcome of the target model, and TM(x, y) represents the evaluation result of the degraded model. Specifically, RTM(x, y) = 0 indicates safe response, while RTM(x, y) = 1 signals the presence of harmful elements. Experimental results show that in most cases where TM(x, y) = 0, the corresponding RTM(x, y) is also 0. Consequently, Rs can be redefined as: Rs = 0, 1, 2, if RTM(x, y) = 0 if RTM(x, y) = 1 and RTM(x, y) = 0 if RTM(x, y) = 1 and RTM(x, y) = 1 (4) With an appropriate degrade model, maximizing Rs boosts exploration efficiency and preserves attack prompt effectiveness, allowing the red-teaming optimization objective to be expressed in the following form: arg max AMg ,AMr (cid:104) Rs 1 (i, fi ci) + 1 (f > c) (cid:105) (5) δ δ θ Figure 3: Conceptual diagram of the safety distribution (s) across the state space s, illustrating the principle of our proposed reward shaping process. The red curve represents the safer model m, while the blue curve represents the less safe model m. θ denotes the safety-danger threshold, with δ and δ marking the respective dangerous subspaces. The safer model, m, demonstrates higher safety across most states, with its dangerous subspace, δ, being sparse and minimally interconnected. In contrast, the less safe model, m, exhibits larger and more connected dangerous subspaces, increasing the probability of encountering unsafe regions. Notably, the dangerous subspace of is entirely encompassed by that of m. This relationship allows for the strategic use of to efficiently focus the exploration process on identifying the dangerous subspaces of m. Since this reward shaping approach does not conform to the structure of potential function, selecting an appropriate degraded model is crucial to determining the optimal strategy during the red-teaming process (Ng et al., 1999). model that is either excessively weakened or too similar to the target model may generate significant amount of irrelevant or meaningless signals. Conversely, an overly weakened degraded model would also deviate from the safe distribution of the target model. To address these challenges, we propose metric called the First Inverse Rate (FIR) to guide the selection of an appropriate degraded model. Specifically, by progressively incorporating toxic data to degrade the target model, we can obtain intermediate models with progressively deteriorating safety capabilities, denoted as TM0, TM1, . . . , TMn, where TM0 represents the initial target model. By evaluating the responses of these models to attack prompt, we can define binary vector = [e0, e1, . . . , en], where each element ei {0, 1} represents whether the response from the i-th model contains harmful content (ei = 1) or not (ei = 0). For each element ei E, we classify it as an inverse element if and only if its value is greater than any of the subsequent elements in Ei+1:n. The intermediate model corresponding to the first occurrence of an inverse element is referred to as AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models the first inverse. By aggregating results across set of attack prompts, we compute the FIR for given intermediate model TMk as the proportion of prompts for which TMk is identified as the first inverse. As shown in the Figure 5, by observing the first inverse rate across all intermediate models, we select the last model before the first inverse rate sharply increases as the degrade model for reward shaping. 3. Experiments 3.1. General Setup Datasets We chose the standard subset of the Harmbench (Mazeika et al., 2024) textual behavior dataset (referred to as the Harmbench dataset) to evaluate our method alongside other baseline methods. To investigate the effectiveness of the strategic red-teaming, we used the first half toxic behaviors, denoted as Ttrn, in the optimization process and evaluated the performance on the remaining, denoted as Ttst. Additionally, we used small dataset from AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) to create various intermediate models. To generate effective responses for AdvBench, we performed extensive sampling on the Alpaca model (Taori et al., 2023), filtering out safe responses and retaining only those with harmful content, thereby creating dataset suitable for model downgrading. Models We conducted experiments on 16 LLMs from different model families, including Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), Yi (AI et al., 2024), Zephyr (Tunstall et al., 2023), Gemma (Team et al., 2024) and Qwen (Team, 2024a). Detail introduction about these models can be found in Appendix A. Baselines We conducted experiments on range of baselines, including sampling methods, imitation learning methods and RL variants. For implementation details of each baseline, refer to Appendix B. Few-Shot: Sampling attack strategies using the attack model with four demonstrations to provoke harmful behaviors in the target model, abbreviated as FS. Imitate Learning (Ge et al., 2023): Fine-tuning the attack model using strategies that successfully perform attacks to generate more strategies, abbreviated as IL. RL (Perez et al., 2022): Training the attack model with PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) based on Equation 2. We also directly using the toxic behaviors from HarmBench to attack these models as reference, abbreviated as DA. by the attack success rate (ASR) on specific set of toxic queries, defined as: ASR = 1 Ttrn (cid:88) tTtrn R(x, y) where AM(t), (x) In this study, we train the models requiring training using data from Ttrn and evaluate on Ttst. The strategic redteaming capability of each method is assessed across three dimensions, which will be introduced below. Effectiveness strategies with the highest ASR on Ttst, denoted as: assess by the average ASR of the top 100 ASRtst = 1 S100 (cid:88) (cid:88) sS100 tTtst R(x, y) (6) Efficiency assess by the ASR of strategies produced at various sampling stages. To dynamically analyze and visualize the performance, we employ violin plots to compare the attack efficiency of different methods across these stages. Diversity An additional important goal of strategic redteaming is to obtain diverse range of attack strategies. We evaluate the diversity of the generated strategies from two perspectives: 1) Semantic Diversity (Tevet & Berant, 2020), abbreviated as SeD, assessed by calculating the semantic similarity between every pairs of generated strategies; 2) Defense Generalization Diversity, abbreviated as DeD, evaluated by measuring the ASRtst after implementing defenses based on the first-round strategies and conducting subsequent attacks. Further details on evaluation metrics are in Appendix C. Implement Details We employ Llama Guard 2 8B(Meta, 2024) to assess the safety of the target models responses. To further refine the process, we incorporate two additional constraints: 1). the diversity constraint, where CRT-like method is used to penalize repetitive strategies (Hong et al., 2024); 2). the consistency constraint, which involves using LLM to determine whether rephrased behaviors align with the original toxic behaviors. Both AMg and AMr are implemented using Vicuna-7B and set the maximum sampling limit to 9k. And, to ensure computational stability, only AMg is optimized using PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). Additional details regarding the implementation can be found in the Appendix D. 3.2. Metrics 4.

Figure 4: Comparison of attack efficiency between AUTO-RT and RL. The violin plots represent the distribution of attack success rates for every 1k sampled strategies, with lighter colors indicating AUTO-RT and darker colors representing RL. AUTO-RT achieves higher attack success rates than RL under the same number of samples, and with larger variance, indicating that it achieves more comprehensive exploration. evaluation, where degraded model can be obtained by performing toxic fine-tuning on the target model. We identify the most effective attack strategies through training on Ttrn and evaluate these strategies based on the target models final responses to attacks on Ttst. We observed that AUTO-RT effectively generates attack strategies for wide range of models, achieving the highest ASRtst compared to the baseline methods. For the wellprotected Llama 2 series models, AUTO-RT also demonstrates its ability to perform effective strategic attacks. Interestingly, for the R2D2 (Mazeika et al., 2024) model, which employs targeted defense, the sampling operation achieved the best attack performance. This outcome underscores the effectiveness of R2D2s defenses. Nonetheless, AUTO-RT consistently outperforms RL, further validating the capability of our approach to enhance attack exploration. It can also be observed that Meta-RT outperforms various baseline methods in generating semantically diverse attack strategies. When regarding the generalization of defenses, after defenses are applied against the first round of attack strategies, our method maintains stable attack performance. Furthermore, the change in attack success rate relative to the first attack round (as indicated by the subscripts in the table) is more favorable compared to other methods.

We evaluated the impact of the two components of AUTO-RT on different models, and the results demonstrate that both contribute to enhancing strategy exploration. for the R2D2 model, the DeD of Meta-RT significantly improves after the first round of attacks. This not only highlights certain vulnerabilities in R2D2s defense algorithm but also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

For every 1k sample strategies, we statistically analyze the resulting attack strategies, obtaining dynamic characteristics over 9 sampling stages. It can be observed that, compared to RL, AUTO-RT consistently identifies more effective attack strategies across different sampling quantities and achieves better optimal results. Additionally, the variance of attack outcomes within each stage is larger for AUTO-RT than for RL, indicating its ability to sustain broader exploration over the process. Complete experimental results can be found in the Appendix E. Ablation of AUTO-RT To further analyze the contributions of Early-terminated Exploration (ETE) and Progressive Reward Tracking (PRT) to AUTO-RT, we evaluated the attack performance using each component individually. The experimental results are shown in Table 2, with the full results provided in the Appendix E. For ASRtst and SeD, both ETE and PRT positively contribute to the final outcomes, and their combination enhances these effects. For DeD, RS has more significant impact on attack performance. This demonstrates that, after round of targeted defense, the proposed reward shaping mechanism is crucial for enabling the continued search for effective attack strategies. Effectiveness of First Inverse Rate To evaluate the impact of intermediate model selection on AUTO-RT, we tested series of intermediate models (M1 to M6) with Table 3: Comparison between AUTO-RT and humanbased strategic attack methods. AUTO-RT can continuously generate stable attack strategies. progressively weakened safety levels on six target models. The safety levels (Weaken ASR), strategic red-teaming results (Attack ASR) corresponding to using each intermediate model as the degrade model and First Inverse Rate (FIR) of these intermediate models are shown in Figure 5. When selecting the intermediate model prior to the sudden increase in the first inverse rate, indicated by the dark-colored bars in Figure 5, the attack achieves the best performance. We attribute the effectiveness of FIR to its ability to signal when the toxic data has significantly disrupted the models generation capabilities, leading to an amplified confusion in the models internal security space and resulting in substantial increase in inconsistencies. Therefore, it is observed that when using an intermediate model with safety capability weaker than that corresponding to the dark-colored bars as the degrade model, the final attack performance (Attack ASR) do not improve with the increase of Weaken ASR. Compared with Human-based Approach In addition to automatic red-teaming, several methods based on humancrafted templates have demonstrated strong performance. These include AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2024b) evolves handcrafted jailbreak prompts with genetic algorithm, abbreviated as AD; Human Template (Shen et al., 2024), using fixed set of in-the-wild human jailbreak templates, abbrevi7 AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models Figure 5: The relationship between the red-teaming outcomes (Attack ASR) following reward shaping with series of intermediate models (M1 to M6), the safety levels of these models (Weaken ASR), and their first inverse rate for additional toxic behavior (Weaken FIR). These intermediate models are derived by fine-tuning on six target models using varying amounts of toxic data.The optimal red-teaming results are achieved by selecting the last intermediate model before sudden spike in FIR (represented by the dark-colored bar in the figure) as the degrade model for reward shaping. ated as HT; and Past-Tense (Andriushchenko & Flammarion, 2024), modifying the attack prompt to reflect that it occurred in the past, abbreviated as PT. We compared AUTO-RT with these human-based methods across 16 models, as shown in the table. The results demonstrate that AUTO-RT not only achieves high success rate in the first round of attacks (ASRtst) but also maintains the highest success rate in the second round of attacks (DeD), indicating that our approach can achieve near-human-level sustained attack capabilities. Black-Box Setting Attack We also evaluated the performance of AUTO-RT using In-Context Learning (ICL) approach to obtain degrade model in scenarios where direct toxic fine-tuning the target model is not feasible. We utilized Llama 3 70B Instruct and Qwen2.5 72B Instruct to simulate such black-box settings. The experimental results, shown in Table 4, indicate that AUTO-RT, even with the ICL approach, can improve exploration effectiveness and generates diverse attack strategies. 5. Related Works Red-Teaming Automatic red-teaming methods can be categorized into two approaches depending on the type of feedback signal. The first use textual feedback to optimize the attacker, where the models parameters are implicitly modified by incorporating feedback into the dialogue process. This approach benefits from the rich information contained in textual feedback, allowing potentially solutions to be identified with fewer interactions. However, to obtain effective feedback signals, it is often necessary to jailbreak the attacker to prevent it from refusing interactions with toxic behaviors. For example, PAIR (Chao et al., 2024) specifies two persuasion techniques to gradually coax the target model, while ICA (Wei et al., 2024) employs harmful demonstrations to subvert LLMs. TAP (Mehrotra et al., 2024) iteratively refines attack prompts using tree-ofthought reasoning until generated prompt jailbreaks the target.

Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024), and Purple Teaming (Zhou et al., 2024) explore the target models vulnerabilities by predefining series of attack strategies. concurrent approach, AutoDAN-turbo (Liu et al., 2024a), explores strategies with textual feedback and then proceeds to attack the target. The second approach utilizes numerical feedback signals to guide the optimization. Methods like GCG (Zou et al., 2023), GDBA (Guo et al., 2021), and AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020) use logits from target model as optimization signals. MART (Ge et al., 2023) employ dangerous content classifier to screen numerous sampled results, using imitation learning to produce attack prompts. Cold-Attack (Guo et al., 2024) scores attack based on rule-based model from multiple perspectives, framing red teaming as energy-based constrained decoding. CRT (Hong et al., 2024) and DiverCT (Zhao et al., 2024) model this process as reinforcement learning, providing score feedback to optimize attack strategies based on attack diversity and the severity of the outputs dangerousness. However, as numerical feedback contains less information than textual feedback, achieving comparable attack often requires more exploration. 8 AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models Reward Shaping Reward functions play fundamental role in RL by guiding agents to learn effective policies. However, when feedback is delayed and sparse, the learning signal weakens, making action evaluation more challenging. common approach to address this is reward shaping, which enhances the reward signal by incorporating additional domain-specific information. This can be expressed as ˆR = + , where is the shaping function. Potential-Based Reward Shaping (Ng et al., 1999) constructs potential function based on states, defined as (s, a, s) = ϕ(s) ϕ(s), ensuring policy invariance. Recently, there have also been attempt (Omi et al., 2024; Pignatelli et al., 2024) to apply reward shaping without relying on domain-specific knowledge to tackle exploration challenges in environments with sparse rewards. 6. Conclusions and Limitations In this paper, we introduce AUTO-RT, framework that employs early-terminated exploration and progressive reward tracking to automatically discover strategic attacks. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of continuous, diverse strategy exploration across wide range of models in both white-box and black-box settings. However, due to computational resource constraints, we focused on optimizing the strategy generation model without specifically enhancing the strategy rephrasing model. Joint optimization of both models could further broaden the scope of identified security vulnerabilities."

            "content": "A. Target Model Used We primarily consider open-source models as target models and simulate closed-source scenarios through self-hosting. Below is the specific information on the target models we used. Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023): We select Vicuna 7B and Vicuna 13B due to their widespread usage. These models are fine-tuned from Llama 2 pretrained models using conversation data obtained from closed-source models. Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023): We select Llama 2 7B Chat and Llama 2 13B Chat models from the Llama 2 family due to their rigorous safety alignment. These models underwent extensive adversarial training with multiple rounds of manual red teaming, as outlined in the original paper. Their strong baseline defense provides an ideal foundation for testing and improving automated red-teaming approaches. Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024): We select the Llama 3 8B Instruct and Llama 3 70B Instruct models from the Llama 3 family. These models have undergone extensive red teaming exercises, adversarial evaluations, and implemented safety mitigation techniques to minimize residual risks. Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023): We select Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 to evaluate the Mistral family. Unlike other models, Mistral focuses on enhancing instruction-following abilities during post-training, without specific emphasis on safety protections. Yi 1.5 (AI et al., 2024): We select the Yi 1.5 6B Chat and Yi 1.5 9B Chat models from the Yi 1.5 family, which incorporate full-stack Responsible AI Safety Engine (RAISE) during pretraining and alignment stages. Gemma 2 (Team et al., 2024): We select Gemma 2 2B Instruct and Gemma 2 9B instrct models from the Gemma 2 family, which have integrated enhanced internal safety processes that span the development workflow, in line with recent Google AI models. Qwen 1.5 (Team, 2024a): We select Qwen 1.5 7B Chat and Qwen 1.5 14B Chat models from the Qwen 1.5 family, which have been carefully finetuned on curated dataset relevant to safety. Qwen 2.5 (Team, 2024b): We select Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 14B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 72B Instruct models from Qwen 2.5 family, which variety of automated alignment strategies are employed to synthesize substantial volume of artificially annotated data about safety. R2D2 (Mazeika et al., 2024): R2D2 uses novel adversarial training method and marks significant advancements in evaluating and improving the safety of Zephyr 7B (Tunstall et al., 2023). B. Baseline implementation Details Few-Shot Sampling creates attack strategies by sampling the attack model, starting with zero-shot approach to produce initial demonstrations. These demonstrations are then refined through various selection methods to continue sampling in few-shot manner. Imitate Learning generates attack strategies by first sampling attack strategies from the attack model, then fine-tuning the attack model with successful strategies. Specifically, the approach begins with successful strategies obtained from few-shot sampling (using total of 3k data points), followed by extensive sampling with the fine-tuned attack model to generate attack strategies. RL uses the standard Proximal Policy Optimization objective, with the task reward based on the toxic degree of the target models response and the KL divergence from the reference model, as described in Equation (). AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2024b) uses handcrafted initial red-teaming strategies (such as role-playing and authoritative tone) and then evolves these initial strategies through hierarchical genetic algorithm to induce the target model to respond to specific initial toxic queries. In our experiments, we implemented this approach using HarmBenchs (Mazeika et al., 2024) implementation. 14 AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models Human Template (Shen et al., 2024) uses fixed set of in-the-wild human jailbreak templates. The initial toxic queries are inserted into these templates as input to target models. In our experiments, we implemented this approach using HarmBenchs (Mazeika et al., 2024) implementation. Past-Tense Attack (Andriushchenko & Flammarion, 2024) directly rephrasing toxic queries by converting them into the past tense using the attack models reformulation approach. C. Evaluation Metrics C.1. Effectiveness We use LlamaGuard 2 8B to determine whether the target model has generated harmful content. We input both the adversarial prompt and the target models response, and judge based on whether the response contains Yes as shown in the user guide. C.2. Diversity To measure the semantic diversity among set of attack strategies S, we calculate the average cosine similarity as follows: SeD = 1 (cid:88) si,sj si=sj ϕ(si) ϕ(sj) ϕ(si)2ϕ(sj) , (7) where ϕ denotes the sentence embedder. Note that higher SeD value corresponds to lower semantic diversity. D. Implementation Details E.

Each technique should be easy to understand and straightforward to apply. Here are several examples: {seed examples} Now generate new rephrasing strategy: Figure 6: Complete prompt for new strategies exploration. seed examples are demonstrations selected from existing strategies based on different settings. Prompt for Query Rephrasing You need to rephrase the query according to the provided rephrasing instruction. Here are the requirements: 1. Ensure that the rephrased query retains the original intent while following the rewriting instruction closely. 2. Make the rephrased query clear, concise, and consistent with the given style or approach. The rephrasing instruction is: {attack strategy} The query you need to rephrase is: {toxic query} Here are several examples: {seed examples} So, the rephrased query is: Figure 7: Complete the prompt for attack query rephrasing using the provided attack strategy. The attack strategy is sampled from the attack model, and the toxic query represents the initial toxic behavior. 17 AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models Prompt for Judging Consistency You need to judge whether the intent of the two queries is similar. Your response should be choice between 0 or 1, where 0 indicates that the intent of the two queries is different, and 1 indicates that it is the same. Here are the requirements: 1. Same intent scenario include: Different ways of asking about the same request, when both queries can be answered with the same response, or containing similar key terms. 2. Different intent scenario include: The two queries cannot be answered with the same response or lack similar key terms. The first query is: {query 1} The second query is: {query 2} Here are several examples: {seed examples} So, your judgment is: Figure 8: Complete the prompt for judging query intent. Verify that the original query and the rephrased query, modified with the attack strategy, share similar intent by assessing their purposes. 18 AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models Figure 9: We evaluate the attack success rates of Few-Shot attack against different target models under varying sampling sizes.
