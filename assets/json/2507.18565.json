            "content": "The human face serves as powerful medium for conveying various characteristics, including expression, age, gender, ethnicity, and identity. Leveraging advancements in machine learning and computer vision, researchers have been able to harness facial images to identify and analyze these human traits, giving rise to significant interest in both academic and industrial circles [1-3]. Two key areas of research have emerged: face image synthesis [4, 5] and face image analysis [6, 7]. Face image synthesis involves the development of techniques to generate realistic facial images based on specific attributes such as age, gender, expression, identity, ethnicity, and pose. On the other hand, face image analysis focuses on interpreting facial images to extract information about these attributes. Among the myriad applications of face image analysis; gender identification and age estimation stand out as particularly intriguing methods with wide-ranging implications, including targeted advertising and humancomputer interaction. It is remarkable how humans possess the innate ability to accurately discern gender and estimate age from facial images, even from young age [8]. However, replicating this capability in machines presents significant challenge. Age estimation, in particular, is complex task influenced by various factors such as facial appearance, expression, makeup, and occlusion [9]. Despite these challenges, advancements in machine learning algorithms offer promising avenues for achieving accurate age estimation from facial images. models capable of accurately estimating age from facial images. Furthermore, gender identification from facial images has garnered significant attention in both psychology and [13-16]. While humans excel at computer vision distinguishing between male and faces with remarkable accuracy, achieving similar performance in automated systems remains challenge. Nonetheless, advancements in object detection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques have paved the way for improved gender identification algorithms [17]. female surveillance The applications of age and gender identification from facial images span diverse domains [18-20], including biometrics, [21-25], electronic customer relationship management, content access control, and targeted advertising [10, 26]. These technologies offer opportunities for enhancing security, personalizing user experiences, and optimizing business processes. in computer vision, machine Although age and gender identification from facial images has advanced, it is still very difficult to achieve human-level accuracy. It will require interdisciplinary cooperation between researchers learning, psychology, and related fields to address these challenges. This study explores the intricate nature of age and gender recognition from facial images, looking into the methods, potential uses, and underlying theories. Through improving our understanding of these mechanisms, we hope to encourage the creation of more accurate and robust algorithms with concrete applications in the real world. Aging, natural and irreversible process, manifests in distinct patterns and variations in facial appearance over time [10]. From changes in facial shape during prepubescence to alterations in skin texture and the emergence of wrinkles in adulthood, the aging process introduces unique challenges for age estimation algorithms [11, 12]. Understanding these aging patterns is essential for developing robust machine learning A. Introduction to Age and Gender Identification Age and gender identification from facial images represent critical tasks in computer vision, with applications across various domains necessitating accurate predictions. These tasks are essential for decision-making processes in fields such as security systems, biometric authentication, medical II. RELATED WORK imaging, demographic research, content-based searches, and surveillance systems. B. Gender Identification Several studies have explored gender prediction from facial images using conventional machine learning methods [27]. These studies typically involve stages such as feature extraction and classification. For instance, one study utilized local binary pattern (LBP) and histogram of gradient (HOG) methods for feature extraction and achieved state-of-the-art results using SVM and KNN classifiers [19, 20, 27]. Another study proposed framework based on Gabor features [19] and ensemble classifiers [14, 16, 28], achieving high accuracy on multiple datasets [29]. Additionally, researchers have explored the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for gender prediction, developing customized architectures with improved efficiency and accuracy [24]. C. Age Estimation feature constraint and multi-stage Age estimation from facial images has been addressed using various approaches, including deep learning-based learning models frameworks. Some studies have focused on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of age estimation through lightweight CNN architectures [30]. Others have proposed ensemble classifiers and label distribution learning techniques to handle the complexity of age variations across different demographic groups [31, 32]. Moreover, researchers have explored the integration of gender classification modules to improve the overall performance of age estimation systems [33]. D. Integration of Age and Gender Identification While many studies have focused solely on either gender prediction or age estimation, limited number have addressed both tasks simultaneously. Integrating age and gender identification presents challenges due to the distinct nature of classification (gender) and regression (age estimation) tasks. However, some approaches have attempted to tackle both tasks within unified framework, leveraging deep learning [34, 35]. models and multi-task Additionally, the incorporation of multimodal data, such as facial and ear images, has shown promise in improving the accuracy of age and gender classification systems [36]. learning strategies E. Research Gap Despite notable progress in age and gender identification from facial images, there remains notable gap in the existing literature. Specifically, there is dearth of comprehensive studies that simultaneously tackle age, gender, ethnicity, and other attributes prediction from facial images. Moreover, the exploration of age variations across different demographic groups, particularly in early childhood and late adulthood scenarios, is not extensively covered. Furthermore, the integration of gender classification modules into age estimation frameworks has not been thoroughly investigated to enhance system performance. Notably, existing studies on simultaneous age and gender classification are not specifically formulated to address the unique requirements of targeted advertisement. In summary, while the literature on age and gender identification from facial images demonstrates significant lacks progress and potential, comprehensive coverage and optimization for targeted advertisement applications. Bridging these gaps through the existing research interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative methodologies is essential for advancing the field and unlocking its full targeted in potential advertisement. including domains, various III. METHODOLOGY in accuracy achieving human-level The problem of age and gender identification is pivotal, with applications spanning various domains. Despite numerous attempts by researchers, as outlined in the related work, gender identification and age estimation remains elusive. Therefore, there is pressing need for further research in this area. This chapter outlines the methodology employed in designing and implementing image-based age and gender identification system. To ensure systematic approach and optimal results, structured methodology for machine learning project development is adhered to. Given the diverse requirements of different machine learning algorithms and the need for meticulous data processing and model evaluation, the adoption of systematic methodologies is imperative. In this study, we have relied on CRISP-DM [37] to serves as structured workflow for age and gender identification, encompassing six stages from conception to deployment. face on facial based A. Problem Understanding Defining the problem is paramount in any machine learning endeavor, laying the foundation for an effective solution. This to conduct age estimation and gender study aims classification images. Following preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, machine learning model will be trained on face image dataset. Model validation will adhere to predefined evaluation criteria, leading to the deployment of the final model for practical use. It's crucial to distinguish between age estimation and gender classification, as they represent distinct yet interconnected challenges. Age estimation involves regression, minimizing the disparity between actual and predicted ages using designated loss function, such as mean squared error. Conversely, gender identification is classification task, categorizing face images into binary genders. While nonbinary gender identification is feasible with sufficient training data, this study focuses on binary classification due to dataset limitations. As both tasks stem from the same dataset, preprocessing steps remain consistent for both solutions. Ultimately, the objective is to accurately predict the age and gender of human subjects. B. Dataset Understanding The dataset understanding section for this study hinges on the specific requirements of age and gender identification tasks. The UTK Face dataset is chosen due to its comprehensive coverage, containing 20,000 annotated face images. These images span wide age range from birth to 116 years and encompass various facial expressions, poses, illuminations, occlusions, and resolutions. The dataset amalgamates images from three primary sources: Morph, longitudinal age dataset comprising 55,134 images of 13,617 individuals aged 16 to 77 years; CACD, cross-age celebrity dataset with 163,446 images of 2,000 celebrities aged from 2004 to 2013; and additional images collected via web crawling, specifically targeting children, newborns, and older adults. FIGURE 1: SIX SAMPLE IMAGES FROM THE DATASET ALONG WITH THE ASSIGNED AGE AND GENDER LABELS. C. Data Preparation Data preparation is crucial, especially considering the chosen model's requirements. Since CNNs are widely used for age estimation and gender classification, we adopt CNN-based approach due to its effectiveness in image processing. Despite CNNs' inherent ability to handle image data with minimal preprocessing, adjustments are needed for the UTK Face dataset. substantial number of images are concentrated in the one to four-year age group (as depicted in Figure 2), potentially biasing model predictions. To mitigate this bias, we randomly sample 20% of the images from this age group, ensuring balanced data distribution. In gender classification, achieving balanced number of samples in each class is crucial to avoid issues arising from class imbalance. Figure 3 displays the number of face images in each class, where class label \"1\" denotes female and \"0\" denotes male. Notably, third class labeled \"3\" is present, likely indicating non-binary gender or an erroneous entry, and images labeled with class \"3\" are removed from the dataset. (a) before performing data balancing (b) after performing data balancing FIGURE 2 DISTRIBUTION OF AGE BEFORE AND AFTER DATA BALANCING FIGURE 3: NUMBER OF FACE IMAGES IN EACH CLASS. Given that CNNs require fixed input resolution, all input images are resized to 200200 pixels. Additionally, feature normalization is applied to enhance training convergence and regularization performance. With 8-bit depth images, pixel values ranging from 0 to 255, feature normalization is conducted using Eq. 1, where 𝑆𝑖 represents the original pixel represents the scaled pixel value. value, and 𝑆𝑖 𝑆𝑖 min(𝑆𝑖) max(𝑆𝑖) min(𝑆𝑖) = (1) 𝑆𝑖 D. Model Building Model building is crucial step that integrates problem understanding, data preparation, and data understanding. Given the utilization of CNNs in this process, the data must be formatted appropriately. One common approach for model training and validation is hold-out validation, where the dataset is randomly divided into training and validation sets to prevent bias. In this experiment, with dataset of 6,647 samples, 70-30 split is chosen due to the limited size of the dataset. The model building process involves various steps, including determining the training strategy (either training from scratch or transfer learning), designing and implementing an image augmenter, defining the CNN architecture, conducting hyperparameter search, and finally, model training and validation. Training Strategy For CNN training, two main strategies are typically employed: training from scratch and transfer learning. Transfer learning involves using pre-trained CNN model trained on larger dataset. However, in this study, pre-trained models from ImageNet did not align well with the problem domain of age and gender prediction. Therefore, training the CNN model from scratch was deemed more suitable, given the small size of the UTK Face dataset. Data Augmentation Data augmentation, technique to increase the effective size of the dataset by introducing variations, was explored. However, due to the alignment and cropping of images in the landmarks, data UTK Face dataset based on facial augmentation did not yield significant improvements. Introducing perturbations resulted in the loss of facial landmarks, consequently reducing prediction performance. CNN Architecture The architecture of CNN serves as the backbone of the modeling process, providing hierarchical structure to learn images. Unlike fully connected neural patterns from networks, CNNs are designed to handle images efficiently by leveraging inherent redundancies. Regularization techniques such as skip connections, dropout, and weight their decay are employed to prevent overfitting. The basic CNN architecture consists of input, convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, culminating in an output layer. In the age estimation architecture, the output layer comprises single neuron with ReLU activation function for regression. This neuron maps the ReLU output to the corresponding age value. Conversely, in gender identification architecture, the last fully connected layer contains one neuron followed by softmax layer for probability computation and classification. Despite slight variations, both architectures follow similar structure, with the last layer tailored to the specific task of age estimation or gender classification. The input layer's size is determined by the dimensions of the input feature vector, which, in this case, is an image of 200x200x3 pixels. This architecture ensures efficient learning of patterns from images and facilitates accurate prediction of age or gender. Table 3 presents the architecture used for model building, noting that while it represents the age estimation model, the gender classification model follows similar structure with adjustments to the output layer. Model Training Model training is the process in which the designed CNN architectures is trained by supplying the pre-processed training data. The model training for both the problems is performed using the training parameters of Table 4. It is to be noted that hyperparameter search is performed using grid search to identify the optimal configuration of model parameters.

Meanwhile, Figure 5 depicts the training progress of the classification CNN for gender prediction from face images. The model utilizes cross-entropy as the loss function and measures validation performance using classification accuracy.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The experimental results section presents the outcomes obtained from the application of the proposed methodologies to address the age estimation and gender prediction tasks using facial images. These results provide insights into the effectiveness and performance of the developed models in accurately estimating ages and predicting genders. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error and classification accuracy are employed to assess the models' performance, providing comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness in real-world applications. A. Model Evaluation Model evaluation quantifies the effectiveness of different model architectures and design decisions. It involves defining evaluation criteria and metrics to measure and compare performance. Two common validation strategies are holdout validation and cross-validation. This study has used holdout validation due to smaller number of samples in the dataset and therefore 30% images are put aside for model testing whereas the rest of 70% images are used for model training and validation. Evaluation Metrics Evaluation metrics vary depending on the problem type and dataset characteristics. For age estimation, regression metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to validate the performance of age estimation. The formulas for both metrics are provided in Eq. 2 and 3."

Discussion The results of the model evaluation demonstrate that the model performs well in both gender prediction and age estimation tasks. The mean absolute error for age estimation indicates that the model has an error of 5.77 years. Even though this error margin is small, further improvements are required to improve the precision of age estimation. By utilizing complementary increase age estimation precision, adding more modalities in addition to face images may greatly improve prediction accuracy. in Furthermore, predicting gender from face images is demonstrated by its 95% accuracy in gender identification. Even with the low error rate of 5%, there is still potential for improvement in terms of gender prediction precision. Notably, younger people have more subtle features that differentiate their faces from those of men and women, which may result in higher gender prediction error rates for this group. This emphasizes how crucial it is to keep improving and optimizing the model in order to attain even higher levels of gender identification accuracy, especially when dealing with younger subjects. It may be possible to further improve the model's predictive performance in age estimation and gender classification tasks by incorporating knowledge from the body of literature on feature extraction and model optimization methods. V. CONCLUSION This study concludes by presenting deep learning-based method for classifying gender and estimating age from facial images. With mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation and 95% accuracy rate for gender identification, the proposed approach shows promise in terms of accurate gender and age prediction. Even though these results show strong predictive abilities, for improvement, especially in terms of minimizing the age estimation error rate and improving the gender prediction accuracy, especially for younger people whose distinguishing characteristics might not be as prominent. In order to further improve prediction performance, future studies may investigate the integration of other modalities in addition to facial images. In general, this research advances methods for estimating age and gender, with potential uses in targeted advertising and other fields. Prospects for novel insights and is still room there uses in computer vision and machine learning are promising when research in this field is pursued further."
