Introduction 1.1. Benchmark Saturation Phenomenon In recent years, the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been remarkable, with their performance on various natural language processing tasks approaching or even surpassing human levels. However, this rapid progress has resulted in significant issue: the benchmark saturation of standardized evaluation sets. Many benchmarks previously regarded as gold standards, such as MMLU, are now easily surpassed by state-of-the-art models with accuracies exceeding 90% (Phan et al., 2025; Hendrycks et al., 2021a). This phenomenon reduces the effectiveness of these benchmarks in distinguishing the true capabilities of different models, particularly the subtle differences among cutting-edge models. prominent example is the MATH dataset; upon its release in 2021, the leading model achieved score of less than 10%. Within just three years, top models have achieved scores over 90% (Hendrycks et al., 2021b). This situation underscores the urgent need for new generation of more challenging evaluation tools to accurately assess and propel the continuous development of AI capabilities. 1.2. Evaluation Needs for Frontier Scientific Reasoning The next substantial breakthrough in artificial intelligence is anticipated to involve solving complex, high-value real-world problems, with scientific discovery as central focus (Wang et al., 2023). AI for Science (AI4S) seeks to expedite the scientific research process through AI, necessitating models to have not only robust knowledge base but also advanced, multi-step, and interdisciplinary reasoning skills (Reddy and Shojaee, 2025; Yu and Jin, 2025; Gottweis et al., 2025). To guide and assess the development of models in this strategic direction, it is essential to construct evaluation benchmarks that specifically test these capabilities. ATLAS is developed for this purpose, aiming to serve as 2 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning touchstone for the AI4S domain, accurately reflecting the scientific reasoning abilities of models. 1.3. Limitations of Existing High-Difficulty Benchmarks To tackle the challenge of benchmark saturation, the research community has developed several high-difficulty evaluation sets. While these initiatives have made significant contributions, they also exhibit limitations. Some benchmarks, despite their difficulty, are overly narrow in scope. For instance, MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), MathBench (Liu et al., 2024a) and OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024) predominantly focus on mathematics or physics competition problems, hindering comprehensive evaluation of models integrated reasoning capabilities across diverse scientific domains. Conversely, benchmarks with broader coverage, such as Humanitys Last Exam (HLE) (Phan et al., 2025) and SuperGPQA (Team et al., 2025), while extremely challenging, are designed to assess general academic knowledge and are not specifically tailored for the deep, integrated scientific reasoning essential in the AI4S domain. Moreover, many existing benchmarks (e.g., AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2024), OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024)) derive problems from public exam or competition question banks, posing persistent risk of data contamination. Models might score highly by having encountered similar or identical problems during training, reflecting memorization rather than authentic reasoning abilities. One of the primary objectives of ATLAS is to fundamentally resolve this issue through rigorous original problem-setting approach. Another limitation is that, for ease of verification, much of the existing work converts problems into multiple-choice questions and simple symbolic expressions (Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Rein et al., 2023; Team et al., 2025; Phan et al., 2025). This method has resulted in disconnect between benchmarks and real-world questions, particularly in scientific domains (Miller and Tang, 2025). In an era of rapid LLM capability expansion, benchmarks should not be confined to easily verifiable problems. ATLAS is designed to preserve real-world problems and solutions, encompassing multiple sub-questions and complex natural and symbolic language expressions, to provide more realistic and effective evaluation of models scientific capabilities. To address the evaluation bottleneck, we propose an effective, transferable and scalable LRM-as-Judge-based (Chiang et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023) evaluation workflow, wherein Large Reasoning Models serve as judge models. We anticipate that as model capabilities advance, the effectiveness of our workflow will be further improved. Concurrently, ATLAS is poised to significantly contribute to the development of LRM-as-Judge. 1.4. Our Contributions This study aims to overcome the aforementioned challenges by constructing ATLAS. Its core contributions can be summarized in the following four points: 1. ATLAS: We release new, highly challenging evaluation benchmark containing approximately 800 expert-created original problems. The benchmark focuses on multidisciplinary scientific reasoning, with target difficulty set to pass rate of less than 20% for current state-of-theart models, to effectively measure the true capabilities of frontier models. ATLAS preserves real-world problems and solutions for realistic and effective evaluation of scientific capabilities. 2. Rigorous, Contamination-Resistant Construction Pipeline: We detail an innovative, multistage data generation and validation process. This process (as shown in Figure 4) deeply integrates the wisdom of human experts with the adversarial testing of large models, ensuring the originality, high quality, and high difficulty of the problems from the source. 3. Transferable and Scalable Evaluation Workflow: We present streamlined and scalable evaluation workflow that utilizes LRM-as-Judge paradigm. This approach facilitates efficient and automated evaluations, allowing researchers and practitioners to assess the reasoning ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning capabilities of their models and conduct reinforcement learning on real-world benchmarks. 4. Sustainable Evaluation Platform: The release of ATLAS is the first step in our long-term plan. Our ultimate goal is to build community-driven collaborative platform that continuously generates and releases high-quality evaluation sets, thereby enabling the long-term, dynamic tracking of progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). 2. Related Work The swift advancement of LLMs necessitates concurrent evolution in evaluation benchmarks, driving them towards increased difficulty, breadth, and methodological rigor. We contextualize our research by examining three significant trends: the transition from broad-coverage to human-centric assessments, the emergence of frontier-difficulty reasoning benchmarks, and the creation of specialized STEM evaluations. Finally, we also discuss the related work of LLM-as-Judge, which is highly related to the evaluation work of ATLAS. 2.1. From Broad Coverage to Human-Centric Benchmarks Initial comprehensive benchmarks like MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), with its multiple-choice questions across 47 subjects, have become \"saturated\" by state-of-the-art models, reducing their ability to differentiate frontier capabilities (Phan et al., 2025). In response, human-centric benchmarks emerged, drawing questions from high-stakes standardized tests to ensure quality and relevance to human cognition. For instance, AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2024) uses questions from exams like the SAT and Gaokao, and C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023) focuses on Chinese academic disciplines. While valuable, these benchmarks are constrained by the difficulty of their source material and face significant, unavoidable risk of data contamination, as test questions are often public (Brown et al., 2020; Li et al., 2024b). Our work directly mitigates these issues through expert-authored, original problems. 2.2. The Rise of Frontier-Difficulty Reasoning Benchmarks To address the limitations of existing tests, new generation of benchmarks aims to create problems at the frontier of machine capabilities, emphasizing originality and resistance to search engine-based solutions. GPQA (Rein et al., 2023) exemplifies this with graduate-level questions whose creation process by multiple domain experts makes them demonstrably Google-proof : experts achieved 65% accuracy while skilled non-experts with web access only reached 34% (Bowman and Dahl, 2021). Similarly, Humanitys Last Exam (HLE) (Phan et al., 2025) employs nearly 1,000 experts and uses state-of-the-art models as an adversarial filter to ensure its 2,500 questions are challenging even for top models like Gemini 2.5 Pro (21.64% accuracy). ATLAS adopts the rigorous methodological principles of GPQA and HLEsuch as expert-driven creation and adversarial filtering (Bras et al., 2020; Kiela et al., 2021)but narrows the focus from general knowledge to the specific, high-value domain of AI for Science. parallel research thrust has created deep, specialized benchmarks for core STEM disciplines. The MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) was landmark, providing challenging competition math problems with step-by-step solutions that have been pivotal for research (Wang et al., 2024). To escalate the difficulty, OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024) incorporates problems from international Olympiads and the most difficult Gaokao questions. The extremely poor performance of models like GPT-4V (17.97%) on this benchmark highlights its immense challenge and reveals critical failure modes in SOTA models (Huang et al., 2024). ATLAS draws inspiration from the focus on deep, complex reasoning inherent in these specialized benchmarks. 4 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning 2.3. Synthesis and Positioning of ATLAS ATLAS synthesizes the strengths of these three distinct trends. We adopt the methodological rigor and originality-first principles of frontier-difficulty benchmarks like GPQA. We draw on the focus on deep, complex reasoning from specialized STEM benchmarks like OlympiadBench. Our core contribution is to apply these principles to novel and strategically important domain: broad but coherent suite of AI for Science subjects. In doing so, ATLAS fills critical gap, providing tool to measure and drive progress on the integrated reasoning skills vital for the next generation of scientific discovery (Luo et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025). The table below provides comparative summary. Table 1: High-Level Comparison of Benchmark Goals and Scope. We summarize prominent highdifficulty reasoning benchmarks, comparing their primary scientific goals and the scope of subjects they cover. Benchmark Primary Goal Subject Scope MMLU GPQA To measure multitask knowledge acquired during pretraining via zeroand few-shot evaluation across wide range of subjects. Covers 57 diverse subjects across STEM, humanities, and social sciences, from elementary to professional level. To support scalable oversight research with Google-proof questions that are difficult for non-experts but verifiable by experts. 448 graduate-level multiple-choice questions in Biology, Physics, and Chemistry. SuperGPQA To scale GPQA-style evaluation to underrepresented and specialized long-tail academic disciplines. Over 26,000 questions covering 285 graduate-level subjects, expanding well beyond traditional STEM. OlympiadBench To test complex, multi-step reasoning on problems requiring creative and rigorous solutions, mirroring top-tier human competition. Olympiad-level problems in Mathematics and Physics sourced from international and national competitions (e.g., IMO, IPhO). HLE ATLAS (Ours) To measure knowledge at the frontier of human academic inquiry, addressing the performance saturation of earlier benchmarks like MMLU. To measure frontier AI for Science (AI4S) reasoning, focusing on tasks central to the scientific discovery process with rigorous human in loop pipeline. Highly challenging questions across Math, Science, Humanities, and CS, including multimodal and short-answer formats. Covers 7 core AI4S subjects and 47 subfields, with natural used questions for science research. 2.4. Additional Discussion of LLM-as-Judge Evaluating LLMs is now central research focus, given their expanding deployment across applications ranging from natural-language processing to decision making. Conventional metrics often overlook the semantic and contextual subtleties of open-ended LLM outputs. Human assessment, while more reliable, is labor-intensive, costly, and hard to scale. The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm has been proposed to overcome these limitations: an advanced LLM appraises the outputs of another model, yielding scalable and economical proxy for human judgment. Foundational studies (Zheng et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023) delineate both the promise and the limitations of this strategy; recent surveys (Chang et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a) chart future directions. Continued progress will depend on mitigating bias, inconsistency, and prompt sensitivity to unlock the full potential of LLM-as-a-Judge systems. 5 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Figure 4: Overview of ATLAS construction pipeline. 3. ATLAS Construction Pipeline In the current AI era, we recognize that the value of an evaluation benchmark depends not only on the questions it contains but, more importantly, on the methodological rigor in their creation. The methodology for constructing evaluation benchmarks has evolved from the straightforward data collection seen in MMLU to the complex, multi-stage, human-machine collaborative processes used by projects like GPQA and HLE, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and credibility (Rein et al., 2023; Team et al., 2025). In line with these advancements, we have designed and implemented rigorous multi-stage process to systematically ensure the high quality, difficulty, and originality of the problems. 3.1. Question Design for Real-World Fidelity Our question design prioritizes realism over evaluation convenience and adheres to the following principles: Question Types. We focus on short-answer and fill-in-the-blank formats. Over 50% of the questions are compound questions with multiple sub-parts. This structure tests models ability to manage complex instructions, maintain long-range context, and perform multi-step reasoning, exposing weaknesses that single questions cannot. Answer Complexity. Answers are designed to be complex entities, such as full LATEX equation ), list of chemical products, or short, high-difficulty but simplified proof. ( 0 𝑒𝑥2𝑑𝑥 = 𝜋 2 Bilingualism. All questions in ATLAS are available in both English and Chinese to support the global research community, practice shared by other frontier benchmarks like OlympiadBench. 3.2. Core Design Principles Our construction process is based on the following four core principles: Frontier Difficulty and Originality. To combat benchmark saturation and data contamination (Phan et al., 2025; Rein et al., 2023), all problems are newly-authored or substantially re-engineered by domain experts. Questions are targeted at graduate-level or higher difficulty, explicitly testing complex, multi-step reasoning rather than information retrieval. 6 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Figure 5: Overview of how ATLAS refine the final answer for natural questions. Hybrid Human-AI Quality and Difficulty Calibration. We employ rigorous, multi-stage validation pipeline. This includes two-tiered, anonymous expert review process for scientific accuracy and clarity, inspired by methodologies from GPQA (Rein et al., 2023). Crucially, this is augmented by an adversarial filtering stage where only problems that state-of-the-art models (e.g., DeepSeekR1) fail to solve with high frequency (e.g., 40% accuracy) are retained, ensuring the benchmark remains at the frontier of AI capabilities. Objective and Complex Answer Formulation. To mirror real-world scientific outputs and prevent guessing, we eschew simple multiple-choice or short-string answers. Every problem features single, objectively verifiable answer, often expressed in complex formats such as LATEX equations, chemical formulas, or structured multi-part responses, demanding generative reasoning rather than simple recognition. 3.3. Data Generation and Quality Assurance Workflow Figure 4 details our data construction and quality assurance workflow. This process combines the deep domain knowledge of human experts with the computational power of large models, forming powerful dual-filter system to ensure that every problem admitted to the final database possesses both high quality and high difficulty. The workflow includes the following key stages: Stage 1: Expert-Sourced Problem Generation and Pre-screening. Our process begins with Ph.D.-level experts from more than 25 different institutions crafting original problems that demand multi-step, and often cross-disciplinary, reasoning. Each submission includes canonical solution and detailed steps. These problems then undergo an automated pre-screening pipeline, which normalizes formatting and performs similarity check against vast offline database of existing problems to filter out duplicates and ensure novelty. Stage 2: Adversarial Filtering and Iterative Refinement. To ensure the questions in our benchmark are both novel and sufficiently challenging, we implement rigorous pipeline for adversarial filtering and iterative refinement. This process consists of two main phases: originality verification and difficulty calibration. First, to mitigate data contamination, each submission undergoes an originality assessment. We employ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to screen submissions against comprehensive corpus of web content, academic papers, and existing benchmarks. This system first retrieves the top-𝐾 most semantically similar entries. Subsequently, 7 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning an LLM is used to evaluate these retrieved items and assign both redundancy and originality scores to the submission. Only submissions that meet high originality threshold advance to the next stage. Following the originality check, problems are evaluated for difficulty by an ensemble of state-of-the-art LRMs. We apply stringent adversarial criterion: problem is accepted only if these LRMs achieve solution accuracy of 40% or less over ten attempts. This strict standard ensures that the final problems robustly challenge current AI capabilities. Problems that do not meet this difficulty threshold are returned to the human experts. They can then choose to discard the problem or iteratively refine it to increase its complexity before resubmission, creating closed-loop quality enhancement process. Stage 3: Multi-Layered Human Validation and Final Ingestion. Problems that pass the adversarial filtering undergo rigorous, multi-stage manual quality inspection. Each problem is sent to three anonymous peer reviewers in the same domain for double-blind evaluation of its correctness, clarity, and difficulty. Discrepancies in reviews are resolved by senior meta reviewer who makes final determination. Finally, before being admitted to the benchmark, last check is performed against online search engines to confirm the problem has not been publicly disclosed. Only problems that clear every stage of this comprehensive validation process are accepted into the final database. Detailed information about human review stage can refer to Section C. Stage 4: Final Answer Refinement and Verification. Following the rigorous validation of the problems, as shown in Figure 5, final stage is dedicated to refining the expert-provided answers to ensure maximum clarity, correctness, and pedagogical value. This process, illustrated in the provided figure, transforms the initial expert solutions into canonical format suitable for the benchmark. The refinement pipeline consists of three key steps: First, LLM agent performs Extraction, decomposing the initial, often verbose, answer into its fundamental components, such as the direct judgment (e.g., the color will fade) and the scientific reasoning. Next, the extracted components undergo semi-automated Quality Check and Reformatting process. During this step, the agent verifies the factual and scientific accuracy of the underlying reasoningfor instance, correcting an initial hypothesis of hydrolysis to the correct mechanism of solvent extraction as shown in the example. Concurrently, the answer is restructured into clear, step-by-step format, eliminating ambiguities and extraneous details. This ensures that the final refined answer is not only correct but also presented in structured and easily digestible manner, thereby enhancing its utility for precise model evaluation. This unique dual-filter system, which combines adversarial LLM filtering with multi-stage manual review, provides robust operational definition for high-quality difficulty. The LLM filtering ensures that problems are challenging for machines, building on the successful experiences of projects like HLE (Phan et al., 2025). The multi-stage manual review ensures that this difficulty stems from the problems scientific depth and complexity, rather than from flaws, ambiguities, or reliance on obscure knowledge, aligning with GPQAs focus on human expert performance (Rein et al., 2023). This hybrid methodology is essential for ensuring the long-term validity and credibility of ATLAS. 4. Dataset Analysis: The ATLAS Corpus The first phase of the ATLAS project has resulted in the ATLAS corpus, which contains approximately 800 high-quality scientific reasoning problems selected through our rigorous process. This section provides detailed analysis of this dataset from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. 8 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning 4.1. Quantitative Overview ATLAS covers seven core disciplines of AI for Science. To provide comprehensive evaluation, we have established several sub-fields under each discipline and ensured balanced distribution of text-only and multimodal problems. The table below shows the detailed statistical distribution of the dataset. Table 2: Statistical Details of the Benchmarks Category Sub-category Count / Percentage ATLAS (Breakdown by Subject) Physics Materials Sci. Chemistry Earth Sci.

Qualitative Examples To give readers more intuitive feel for the characteristics of the problems in ATLAS, we present few representative examples from different subjects shown in Question 4.1 and Question 4.2. Question 4.1: Mathematics Example Sub-field: Algebra and Geometry Problem: Let 𝑝 be an odd prime, and let 𝑚 0 and 𝑁 1 be integers. Let Λ be free Z/𝑝𝑁 Z-module of rank 2𝑚 + 1, and let be perfect symmetric Z/𝑝𝑁 Z-bilinear form. Here, perfect means that the induced map (, ) : Λ Λ Z/𝑝𝑁 Λ HomZ/𝑝𝑁 Z(Λ, Z/𝑝𝑁 Z), 𝑥 (𝑥, ) is an isomorphism. Find the number of elements in the set {𝑥 Λ (𝑥, 𝑥) = 0} as function of 𝑝, 𝑚, 𝑁 . Solution: For each integer 0 𝑛 𝑁 , let Λ(𝑛) := {𝑥 Λ (𝑥, 𝑥) 𝑝𝑛Z/𝑝𝑁 Z}. Let 𝐶(𝑛) := Λ(𝑛). We want to compute 𝐶(𝑁 ). It is trivial that 𝐶(0) = Λ = 𝑝(2𝑚+1)𝑁 ... We can establish two claims: 1. For 𝑛 2, the multiplication-by-𝑝 map Λ(𝑛 2)/𝑝𝑛1Λ Λ(𝑛)/𝑝𝑛Λ is bijection. 2. For 𝑛 2, the map Λ(𝑛)/𝑝𝑛Λ Λ(𝑛 1)/𝑝𝑛1Λ is 𝑝2𝑚-to-1. These claims lead to the recurrence relation: 𝐶(𝑛) = 𝐶(𝑛) + 𝐶(𝑛) = 𝑝(2𝑚+1)𝐶(𝑛 2) + 𝑝(2𝑚+1)(𝑁 1)(𝑛1)(𝑝2𝑚 1). Solving this recurrence yields the final result for 𝐶(𝑁 ). 9 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Refined Final Answer: 𝑝(2𝑚+1)𝑟+2𝑚(𝑁 2𝑟) + 𝑝(2𝑚+1)𝑟1 𝑝(2𝑚+1)1 𝑟 := 𝑁/2. Source Organization: Fudan University 𝑝(2𝑚+1)𝑟1+2𝑚(𝑁 2𝑟)(𝑝2𝑚 1), where Question 4.2: Biology Example Sub-field: Immunology Problem: Background: In the innate immune system, RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family proteins recognize viral RNA in the cytoplasm, triggering the downstream mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). MAVS acts as signaling adapter, recruiting multiple proteins to form the MAVS signalosome, which activates transcription factors IRF3 and NF-𝜅B, inducing the expression of type and type III interferons (IFNs) and other antiviral genes. 1. What is the core RNA-binding region of MAVS? 2. In the interaction mechanism between the key adapter protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) and cellular RNA in innate immunity, what part of the cellular mRNA does MAVS directly bind to via its central disordered domain to regulate downstream antiviral signal transduction of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs)? 3. Treatment with RNase disrupts the stability of what complex, and reduces what property of transcription factors like IRF3 and NF-𝜅B p65, indicating that cellular RNA is crucial for the activation and formation of the MAVS signalosome? Refined Final Answer: 1. Central disordered region 2. 3UTR (3 Untranslated Region) 3. MAVS signalosome complex; phosphorylation level Source Organization: Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine ATLAS distinguishes itself by focusing on problems that demand synthesis of expert-level domain knowledge and complex, multi-step reasoning chains. The generative, short-answer format fundamentally prevents guessing and forces models to construct answers from first principles. For instance, the mathematics problem shown requires not just recalling definitions from abstract algebra but performing multi-step, non-trivial derivation involving recurrence relations over finite ring Z/𝑝𝑁 Z. This probes models ability to manipulate abstract symbolic structures. Furthermore, the problems often necessitate causal and mechanistic reasoning, as seen in the biology example. To answer correctly, model must navigate the complex cascade of the MAVS signaling pathway, identifying specific molecular components (central disordered region), their binding targets (3UTR), and the functional consequences of their interactions (phosphorylation). This requires integrating disparate facts into coherent causal model, hallmark of true scientific understanding. Many problems in the corpus are not self-contained; they implicitly assume knowledge base equivalent to that of an advanced undergraduate or graduate student in the field. This knowledge-intensive nature, combined with the demand for rigorous, generative reasoning, establishes ATLAS as challenging and realistic benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of nextgeneration AI models in the scientific domain. ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning 4.3. Language and Structural Characteristics The problems in ATLAS are also challenging in terms of language and structure. The average length of problem statement is about 65 words, but some problems describing complex scenarios can exceed 200 words. The answer format is short answer or fill-in-the-blank, requiring the model to generate precise text, numerical values, or mathematical expressions in LATEX format. The extensive use of LaTeX (especially in physics and mathematics problems) places higher demands on the models ability to generate and understand symbols. Compared to multiple-choice questions, this generative evaluation method can more effectively prevent models from scoring by guessing, thus more accurately reflecting their reasoning and expression abilities. 5. Evaluation and Performance In this section, we conduct an extensive evaluation of ATLAS. We firstly establish standardized evaluation framework to assess the performance of LLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate several leading LLMs and provide comprehensive analysis. 5.1. Setup LLMs. We encompass representative series of frontier large reasoning models for evaluation, incorporating both closed-source proprietary models and prominent open-source models. The examined closed LRMs include: OpenAI GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025), OpenAI o3 (OpenAI, 2024), OpenAI o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro (Comanici et al., 2025), Grok-4 (xAI, 2025), and Doubao-Seed-1.6thinking (ByteDance Seed, 2025), as well as open-source LRMs such as DeepSeek-V3.1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024), GPT-OSS-120B (Agarwal et al., 2025), DeepSeek-R1-0528 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), Qwen3-235B-A22B (Yang et al., 2025), Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 (Yang et al., 2025), and GLM4.5 (Zeng et al., 2025). Judge as Reasoning. As previously noted, the answers in ATLAS comprise multiple responses, along with complex natural language and symbolic descriptions, which complicate the assessment of the alignment between model predictions and true answers using rule-based heuristic methods (Li et al., 2024a; Zheng et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2025). To address this challenge, we regard the evaluation of ATLAS as complex reasoning task, employing prominent large reasoning models to evaluate the model prediction results. In this paper, we utilize two models, OpenAI o4-mini (OpenAI, 2024) and GPT-OSS-120B (Agarwal et al., 2025), as Judge models. Metrics. Referencing typical reasoning tasks such as code (Chen et al., 2021) and mathematics (Hendrycks et al., 2021b; OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), we report the average accuracy across multiple inferences and G-Pass@𝑘 (Liu et al., 2024b) to assess the stability of LLMs performance. Implementation Details. For the closed-source LLMs (i.e., LRMs), we utilize the official API to obtain predictions, while for the open-source LLMs, we deploy them using serving frameworks like SGLang (Zheng et al., 2024) and vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) for inference. We set the maximum number of generation tokens for each LLM to 32,768, and the sampling temperature is established at 0.6. For each question, we generate 4 predictions. The complete experiment roughly consumed all the API quota worth $3,000, as well as hundreds of GPU Hours. 11 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Figure 6: Overview of the evaluation workflow. During the evaluation process, the LLM is prompted to provide formatted predictions, from which the answers are extracted and input into the Judge LLMs for the computation of evaluation metrics. 5.2. Evaluation Workflow Considering the complexity of evaluation of ATLAS, it is difficult to evaluate the models performance through simple and conventional evaluation processes. We propose comprehensive and user-friendly evaluation framework for assessing ATLAS based on the OpenCompass (Contributors, 2023) repository. As illustrated in Figure 6, the evaluation workflow consists of the following steps: 1) Prediction Generation; 2) Answer Parsing; 3) Judgment Generation; 4) Judgment Parsing. Step 1: Prediction Generation. We provide each LLM (i.e., LRM) detailed instruction to generate predictions as shown in Prompt E.1. The LLM is prompted to solve the given question step by step and must put their final answers in the JSON format. The advantages of this approach are as follows, which facilitates the extraction of answers, particularly for questions with multiple sub-questions. Step 2: Answer Parsing. After obtaining the predictions from the LLM, we parse the JSON-formatted answers to extract the final answers. Step 3: Judgment Generation. During this step, we input the original question, the parsed answer, and the ground truth into the Judge LLM. The Judge LLM generates assessments based on the instructions provided in Prompt E.2. Our instructions direct the LLM to evaluate the correctness of each sub-answer while considering reasonable error, providing its judgments for each sub-answer in JSON format. Step 4: Judgment Parsing. Similar to the parsing of the answers, we parse the JSON-formatted judgments and calculate the evaluation metrics. Our evaluation workflow offers insights into the assessment of complex problems. It not only provides judgment results for the overall outcome but also delivers fine-grained judgment results, which are beneficial for applications in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards. 5.3. Quantitative Results In this section, we present the quantitative results and analysis of the evaluation conducted on the validation set of ATLAS. For more detailed results on the test set of ATLAS, please refer to Section F. 12 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Table 3: The performance of various LLMs on the validation set of ATLAS, as judged by GPT-OSS-120B, is sorted by average accuracy. Each LLM is prompted to generate four predictions, and we report the average accuracy as well as the mG-Pass@{2, 4} scores. high mG-Pass score indicates high level of stability across multiple predictions.

The evaluation performance show in Table 3 on the validation set of ATLAS reveals that: 1) OpenAI GPT-5-High stands out as the top-performing model, achieving the highest accuracy (42.9%) and exhibiting strong prediction stability, with mG-Pass@2 at 34.7% and mGPass@4 at 32.1%; 2) The mG-Pass scores corroborate the accuracy results, indicating that models with higher accuracy typically exhibit greater stability across multiple predictions; 3) notable performance disparity exists between the top-tier models (OpenAI GPT-5, OpenAI o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4). Specifically, OpenAI o3-High ranks second with an accuracy of 35.3%, maintaining stability with mG-Pass@2 at 25.3% and mG-Pass@4 at 23.4%. Gemini-2.5-Pro closely follows, recording an accuracy of 34.1% and mG-Pass scores of 25.8% (@2) and 24.1% (@4), indicating competitive stability. The remaining models, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 (26.4%), DeepSeek-V3.1 (25.3%), Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 (26.1%), Doubao-Seed-1.6-thinking (26.1%), OpenAI o4-mini (22.4%), and GPT-OSS-120B-High (21.7%) exhibit progressively lower accuracy and stability. Notably, some open-source LLMs like DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 still deliver competitive results compared to other proprietary systems in the lower tier. Subject Performance. Figure 7 demonstrates the performance of different LLMs across different subjects of ATLASs validation set. Across all subjects and metrics, OpenAI GPT-5 consistently leads, achieving the highest accuracy and mG-Pass scores by clear margin. Gemini-2.5-Pro also produces competitive results, particularly in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Grok-4 shows notable strength in CS, achieving the highest performance in this domain. In contrast, Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 and Qwen3-235B-A22B generally exhibit the lowest scores across most subjects and metrics, indicating weaker performance in this ATLAS evaluation. OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek-V3.1 display moderate performance, while Doubao-Seed-1.6-thinking yields mixed results, performing relatively well in some areas but lagging in others. For Specific Subjects: Chemistry: OpenAI GPT-5 clearly dominates, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro, while Grok-4 and Doubao-Seed-1.6-thinking perform moderately well. CS: Grok-4 significantly outperforms all other models, achieving the highest accuracy and mG-Pass scores, with GPT-5 and o3 trailing behind. Earth Sci.: OpenAI GPT-5 leads with the highest accuracy and stability, while o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro achieve moderate performance. 13 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Figure 7: The performance of different LLMs across different subjects of ATLASs validation set. Physics: GPT-5 achieves the strongest results, with Gemini-2.5-Pro and o3 also showing competitive performance. Materials Sci.: GPT-5 dominates this domain, while Gemini-2.5-Pro and o3 form the second tier of performance. Biology: GPT-5 again leads by wide margin, with Gemini-2.5-Pro and Grok-4 performing moderately well. Mathematics: GPT-5 achieves the highest performance, followed by Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, which shows competitive results, while Gemini-2.5-Pro also performs strongly. Finally, we observe that the mG-Pass@{2, 4} scores generally align with the trend of accuracy, indicating that models with higher accuracy also demonstrate greater inference stability. GPT-5s consistently high mG-Pass@{2, 4} scores across all domains underscore its leading performance, while Grok-4s dominance in CS highlights its particular strength in this field. Conversely, the lower mG-Pass@{2, 4} scores for models such as Qwen3-235B-A22B indicate not only reduced accuracy but also less stable or more variable predictions. 14 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Table 4: Answer extraction error rate of different LLMs on ATLAS.

During the evaluation process, the inability to extract answers can detrimentally affect the models performance. In our evaluation workflow, the main extraction errors originate from prediction truncation and JSON parsing errors. Consequently, we have documented the rates of answer extraction errors across various LLMs, as illustrated in Table 4. notable observation from the table is that almost models achieved 0.00% JSON Parse Error rate. This result is excellent, indicating that once an answer is generated, the JSON output structure remains consistently valid across all evaluated LLMs. This result implies robust parsing capabilities or careful adherence to JSON formatting of current salient LLMs, which is crucial for automated judgment and verification in data synthesis and reinforcement learning. Conversely, the Truncation Rate reveals significant variations in performance. OpenAI o4-mini is exceptional, exhibiting 0.00% Truncation Rate, indicating it never truncates its answers, thereby ensuring complete responsesan essential characteristic for applications requiring comprehensive information. OpenAI o3 also demonstrates very low truncation rates at 1.58%, indicating that it rarely truncates its answers. While not perfect, these rates are commendable, suggesting that the majority of its answers are complete. DeepSeekR1-0528 and Gemini-2.5-Pro display moderate truncation rates of 2.16% and 3.49%, respectively. The models with the highest truncation rates are Doubao-Seed-1.6-thinking at 8.22% and Grok-4 at 10.38%. These statistics are concerning, as they imply that over 8% and 10% of their generated answers are truncated, respectively. This suggests that the models may produce excessively lengthy chains of thought and necessitate improvements in their efficiency. To illustrate the impact of output budget, we conducted experiments with token budget of 64k compared to 32k, as detailed in 15 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Table 6: Summary of the primary error categories of ATLAS. We randomly sample 200 judge explanations of erroneous predictions to identify and summarize the most frequent error modes.

As presented in Table 5, while most LLMs exhibit improved performance with increased limits from 32k to 64k output tokens, this extension in output length incurs significant inference overhead, particularly given the parameter size of contemporary LLMs. This underscores the importance of enhancing the inference efficiency of LLMs. Error Category. To provide valuable insights into areas where improvement efforts would have the most impact, we analyze the errors in the prediction results, as summarized in Table 6. The results reveal that numerical discrepancies are the most prevalent error category, accounting for 27.0% of all errors. This finding suggests that precision in numerical outputs or calculations poses significant challenge. Following numerical discrepancies, mathematical errors represent the second largest category at 16.5%, indicating difficulties with the application of correct formulas, equations, or expressions. Missing components (13.0%) and structural mismatches (11.0%) are also significant error types, underscoring issues related to completeness and adherence to expected output formats. Additionally, incorrect methods and reasoning account for notable proportion, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the current LLMs professional knowledge within the scientific domain. Judge Model. Given that our evaluation is highly related to the judge model used, we analyze the performance of various advanced reasoning models used as judge models. As demonstrated in Table 7, we compare the performance evaluations conducted by Qwen3-235B-A22B and GPT-OSS16 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Table 7: The performance comparison between judged by Qwen3-235B-A22B and GPT-OSS-120B is as follows: \"+\" subscript indicates that the score judge by Qwen3-235B-A22B outperforms that by GPT-OSS-120B, while \"-\" signifies the opposite. Model Accuracy (%) mG-Pass@2 (%) mG-Pass@4 (%) OpenAI o3 Gemini-2.5-Pro Grok-4 DeepSeek-R1-0528 30.35.3 31.33.6 30.72.2 22.03.8 19.36.4 21.03.4 21.83.2 12.92.6 17.36.9 19.33.2 19.93.6 11.32.1 120B, respectively. Across nearly all models and metrics, Qwen3-235B-A22B typically allocates lower scores than GPT-OSS-120B in the domains of Accuracy, mG-Pass@2, and mG-Pass@4. To investigate these differences, we conducted case analysis comparing the judgments of GPT-OSS-120B and Qwen3-235B-A22B. As demonstrated in Case 5.1, which involves computer science question in the validation set of ATLAS, OpenAI o3 produced the prediction 𝑡𝑛 = 2𝑛 ln 𝑛(1 + 𝑜(1)). In the context of algorithm complexity in computer science, log and ln are equivalent, verifying the correctness of OpenAI o3s prediction. However, Qwen3-235B-A22B fails to acknowledge this equivalence, leading to an incorrect judgment. Additionally, in Case 5.2, which shows Materials Sci. question, OpenAI o3 accurately predicts the outcomes for two sub-questions, whereas Qwen3-235B-A22B erroneously assumed that the prediction yes,no pertained to single question, resulting in an incorrect judgment. Lastly, as illustrated in Case 5.3, involving physics question, OpenAI o3 provided an answer of 1.6 102N, exhibiting relative error of 0.376% compared to the standard answer, thus meeting the permissible error conditions specified in our judge prompt (Prompt E.2). Consequently, it should be deemed correct. However, Qwen3-235B-A22B erroneously identified the absolute error as the relative error, resulting in an incorrect judgment. The case analysis results indicate that reasoning models with advanced capabilities also exhibit superior judgment accuracy. Compared to GPT-OSS120B, Qwen3-235B-A22B is more susceptible to errors in knowledge and semantic understanding. Nonetheless, assessing the effectiveness of judgment models requires further investigation, which falls outside the scope of this paper. We hope the introduction of ATLAS will encourage the community to advance research on judgment models for questions that are difficult to verify. Case 5.1: Case in CS subject Question: Given an array 𝐴[1 : 𝑛] of 𝑛 distinct numbers, recall the *quicksort* algorithm to sort them into an ascending order. First we let 𝑝 𝐴[1] be the pivot. Then we use 𝑝 to rearrange 𝐴[1 : 𝑛] in the following way: For some 𝑘 [𝑛], we have 𝐴[𝑘] = 𝑝; For all 𝑖 {1, 2, . . . , 𝑘 1}, we have 𝐴[𝑖] < 𝑝; For all 𝑖 {𝑘 + 1, . . . , 𝑛}, we have 𝐴[𝑖] > 𝑝. Then recursively sort 𝐴[1 : 𝑘 1] and 𝐴[𝑘 + 1; 𝑛]. Assume our algorithm used in step 2 to compute 𝐴[1 : 𝑘 1] and 𝐴[𝑘 + 1 : 𝑛] is *stable*. That is, if 𝐴[𝑖] and 𝐴[𝑗] are both smaller or larger than 𝑝 and 𝑖 < 𝑗, then after the rearrangement, 𝐴[𝑖] still appear before 𝐴[𝑗]. Clearly the performance of the algorithm depends on the input array 𝐴. In this problem, we analyze its *average complexity*. Suppose that the input array 𝐴 is chosen uniformly at 17 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning random from the 𝑛! permutations of the 𝑛 distinct numbers. Let 𝑡𝑛 be the average times of comparisons during the execution of quicksort (the average is taken over all inputs). Find the general expression for 𝑡𝑛. (In the problem, we do care about the constant appearing in the main term. As result, your expression should be of the form 𝑡𝑛 = 𝑓 (𝑛)(1 + 𝑜(1)) for some 𝑓 (𝑛)). Ground Truth: 𝑡𝑛 = 2𝑛 log 𝑛(1 + 𝑜(1)) Model Prediction (OpenAI o3): 𝑡𝑛 = 2𝑛 ln 𝑛(1 + 𝑜(1)) Judgement by Qwen3-235B-A22B: label: () explanation: The candidates answer uses natural logarithm (ln) while the standard answer uses log (typically base 2 in algorithm analysis). The expressions differ by constant factor (ln 𝑛 vs. log 𝑛), which violates the requirement to match the constant in the main term. The standard answer requires the form 2𝑛 log 𝑛(1 + 𝑜(1)), but the candidates answer 2𝑛 ln 𝑛(1 + 𝑜(1)) is not semantically equivalent due to the logarithm base discrepancy. Judgement by OpenAI o4-mini: label: () explanation: The candidates expression 𝑡𝑛 = 2(𝑛+1)𝐻𝑛 4𝑛 = 2𝑛 ln 𝑛+𝑂(𝑛) = 2𝑛 ln 𝑛(1+ 𝑜(1)) is asymptotically equivalent to the standard 2𝑛 log 𝑛(1 + 𝑜(1)). Case 5.2: Case in Materials Sci. subject Question: Does the recovery of the material include decrease in dislocation density and reduction in grain boundary area? Ground Truth: The reduction in dislocation density belongs to recovery, while the decrease in grain boundary area does not belong to recovery. Model Prediction (OpenAI o3): yes, no Judgement by Qwen3-235B-A22B: label: () explanation: The candidates answer contains multiple conflicting selections (yes and no), making it invalid under the REPETITIVE criterion as it includes contradictory outputs in single response. Judgement by OpenAI o4-mini: label: () explanation: The candidate correctly answered yes for dislocation density reduction and no for grain boundary area reduction, matching the standard answer. ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Case 5.3: Case in Physics subject Question: bowl is symmetrically inverted and immersed in dense fluid with specific gravity 𝑆𝐺 = 15.6. The immersion depth is 200 mm (measured along the centerline from the edge of the bowl). The height of the bowl is 80 mm, and the fluid rises 20 mm inside the bowl. The bowl is made of clay formulation with specific gravity 𝑆𝐺 = 6.1, an inner diameter of 𝐷 = 100 mm, and the volume of the bowl itself is approximately 0.9 𝐿. Calculate the force 𝐹 required to hold the bowl in its current position. Ground Truth: 𝐹 = 159.4N Model Prediction (OpenAI o3): 1.6 102N (downward) Judgement by Qwen3-235B-A22B: label: () explanation: The candidates answer 1.6 102N = 160N differs from the standard answer 159.4N by 0.6N, exceeding the 0.1 tolerance for numerical equivalence. While the direction (downward) is physically reasonable, the standard answer does not include directional information, and the magnitude discrepancy invalidates strict equivalence. Judgement by OpenAI o4-mini: label: () explanation: The candidates value of 1.6 102N(160N) is within the acceptable tolerance of the standard 159.4N. The added direction does not conflict with the standard. 6. Discussion and Future Work 6.1. Implications of the Results The benchmark results from ATLAS clearly indicate that while large models exhibit astonishing capabilities in many areas, there remains huge gap between them and human experts in scientific domains that require deep, rigorous, and comprehensive reasoning. This finding is significant for our understanding and planning of the path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It suggests that true general intelligence lies not only in linguistic fluency and breadth of knowledge but, more importantly, in mastering the structured, verifiable, and highly complex reasoning paradigm of science. The evaluation results of ATLAS provide us with sober and quantitative measure of how far we are from achieving AI capable of reliable scientific discovery. This aligns with the vision of projects like HLE, which aim to provide roadmap for future research (Phan et al., 2025). 6.2. Limitations of ATLAS We also recognize the limitations of our current work. First, the scale of the initial dataset, with about 800 problems, while involving huge investment in the quality of each problem, is smaller in total number than some larger-scale benchmarks. Second, the current version of ATLAS is predominantly composed of Chinese and seven core scientific subjects. These limitations are the starting point for our future work and also reflect our commitment to academic rigor. 19 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning 6.3. The ATLAS Platform: Future Roadmap The ATLAS project is not one-time data release but the beginning of long-term, continuous construction plan. Our vision is to build an open, collaborative ATLAS platform to continuously promote the development of AI scientific reasoning capabilities. The future roadmap includes: Continuous Content Updates: We plan to regularly release new problem packs to keep pace with the rapid development of models and prevent \"overfitting\" of the evaluation benchmark. This will ensure that ATLAS can serve as an effective tool for measuring the capabilities of frontier models over the long term. Expanding the Scope of Evaluation: Future versions will gradually expand their coverage to include more scientific fields (such as neuroscience, pharmacy, environmental science, etc.), more languages (especially English), and possibly new task formats (such as hypothesis generation, experimental design, literature review, etc.), to more comprehensively evaluate the scientific capabilities of models. Building Community Collaboration Ecosystem: We will establish collaborative platform to invite domain experts from around the world to participate in the problem creation and review process. By drawing on the community collaboration models of projects like HLE (Phan et al., 2025), we can gather broader range of wisdom to ensure the continuous high-quality development of ATLAS and make it public resource truly owned and maintained by both the scientific and AI communities. 7. Conclusion In response to the challenges of benchmark saturation and data contamination faced by current large model evaluations, this paper proposes and constructs new high-difficulty, multidisciplinary scientific reasoning benchmarkATLAS. Through rigorous process combining expert-original problem creation, adversarial model filtering, and multi-stage blind review, we have ensured the high standards of originality, quality, and difficulty of ATLAS. The initial dataset focuses on the core areas of AI for Science, presented in Chinese, filling an important gap in the existing evaluation ecosystem. Systematic evaluation of the most advanced current models shows that all models perform poorly on ATLAS, confirming the benchmarks effectiveness as touchstone for frontier capabilities and revealing significant deficiencies in the deep scientific reasoning of the current AI. Through in-depth analysis of model performance and error patterns, we provide specific diagnostic information and research directions for future AI model improvements. We believe that ATLAS and its future continuous development will provide valuable and reliable tool for measuring and guiding the progress of AI capabilities in the key area of scientific discovery, thereby promoting the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence more robustly and clearly. 20 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning"

Prompt E.2: Prompt for Judgement You are an expert answer grader. Your task is to evaluate whether the candidates final answer matches the provided standard answer. Follow the grading protocol strictly and do not generate or modify answers. Only compare the candidates response to the given standard. Evaluation Guidelines 1. Reference Standard The standard answer is always correct never question its validity. The question itself is valid do not critique or reinterpret it. Do not regenerate, fix, or complete the candidates answer only evaluate what is provided. 2. Comparison Strategy Carefully analyze the question type and standard answer format: Determine whether an exact match is required, or whether partial correctness is acceptable (e.g., for multi-component or expression-based answers). This judgment should be based on the questions phrasing and answer structure. Evaluate only the candidates final answer, ignoring reasoning or explanation. (cid:8) (cid:9) (cid:8) (cid:9) 32 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Ignore differences in formatting, style, or variable naming, as long as the content is equivalent. For mathematical expressions, check step-by-step equivalence (e.g., by simplifying both expressions and comparing results). For multiple-choice questions, only the final selected option and its associated content matter. For decimal or fraction comparisons, consider the answers equivalent if the relative error is 0.1. 3. Multi-part Answers If the question requires multiple components or selections, all parts must match the standard answer exactly. Compare each component individually. Partial correctness is not acceptable label as incorrect if any part is wrong. 4. Validity Check Immediately reject the candidates answer if it meets any of the following criteria: INCOMPLETE: Final sentence is cut off or the answer is clearly unfinished. REPETITIVE: Contains repeated phrases or outputs in loop. REFUSAL: Explicitly states inability to answer (e.g., cannot answer this question). Use label C."

Performance on the Test Set of ATLAS Overall Performance. Table 13 presents the performance of all LLMs evaluated on the test set of ATLAS, as judged by GPT-OSS-120B, and ordered by average accuracy. OpenAI GPT-5-High ranks highest with an accuracy of 43.8%, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro at 39.9%, OpenAI o3-High at 37.4%, and Grok-4 at 35.4%. The lower-performing models include Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 at 39.6%, Doubao-Seed-1.6-thinking at 28.8%, DeepSeek-R1-0528 at 26.1%, OpenAI o4-mini at 24.1%, and GPT-OSS-120B at 23.3%. The mG-Pass@2 and mG-Pass@4 scores, which indicate stability across multiple predictions, exhibit similar pattern, with OpenAI GPT-5-High achieving the highest scores of 34.2% and 33.5%, respectively, while GPT-OSS-120B scores the lowest, at 14.6% and 12.8%. In comparison to Table 3, where OpenAI GPT-5-High leads with an accuracy of 42.9%, followed closely by Gemini-2.5-Pro at 35.3%, the overall ranking remains consistent, though OpenAI o3 models show competitive performance in the mid range. Furthermore, the accuracy of OpenAI o4-mini shows only slight variation, from 24.1% in Table 3 to 22.4% in Table 13, suggesting relative consistency. Other models also demonstrate minor fluctuations. Subject Performance. Figure 10 illustrates the performance of all LLMs across different subjects in ATLASs test set. OpenAI GPT-5 consistently achieves the highest accuracy and mG-Pass scores across all subjects, standing out as the clear leader. Gemini-2.5-Pro also delivers competitive results, particularly in Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. Grok-4 demonstrates notable strength in Computer Science, achieving the best scores in this domain. In contrast, Qwen3-235B-A22B and Qwen3-235BA22B-2507 generally show weaker performance across most subjects, while DeepSeek-R1-0528 and OpenAI o4-mini remain in the lower tier with moderate results. Doubao-Seed-1.6-thinking and DeepSeek-V3.1 produce mixed outcomes, performing well in some subjects but lagging in others. For Specific Subjects: Chemistry: OpenAI GPT-5 leads by large margin, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro, with Grok-4 and Doubao-Seed-1.6-thinking showing moderate results. Computer Science: Grok-4 achieves the best overall performance, with GPT-5, o3, and DoubaoSeed-1.6-thinking trailing behind. Earth Science: GPT-5 ranks highest, while Gemini-2.5-Pro and o3 achieve competitive performance. 36 ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning Figure 10: The performance of different LLMs across different subjects of ATLASs test set. Physics: GPT-5 dominates, with Gemini-2.5-Pro also performing strongly. Materials Science: GPT-5 again leads, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro and o3 as the next tier of models. Biology: GPT-5 significantly surpasses all other models, while Gemini-2.5-Pro and o3 achieve moderate accuracy and stability. Mathematics: GPT-5 shows overwhelming dominance, with Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 and Gemini2.5-Pro forming the second tier of performance. By comparing these performances with those on the validation set (Figure 10), we can assess the consistency of the subject-specific outcomes. For example, GPT-5 consistently dominates across both datasets, while Grok-4 maintains its strength in Computer Science. Such consistency highlights the inherent strengths and weaknesses of the models across knowledge domains. ATLAS : High-Difficulty, Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Frontier Scientific Reasoning G.
