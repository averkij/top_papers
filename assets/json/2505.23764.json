            "content": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced their ability to ground language and vision in the physical world [35, 12, 47], making them promising stepping-stone toward embodied artificial general intelligence (AGI). core capability of MLLMs deployed in the physical world is spatial intelligencethe skill to understand where things are, how they move, etc. To steer progress toward this goal, the community needs rigorous, diverse, and challenging evaluation benchmarks that can serve as north stars for progress. However, most existing benchmarks probe only single-image spatial understanding and restrict themselves to straightforward spatial relations [34, 56, 27, 17, 15]. Real-world spatial understanding is more complex: models must reason across multiple images to track object and ego motion, and relate entities that never co-occur in single frame [62, 58, 38]. Without benchmarks that demand such multi-image reasoning, we cannot reliably measure or improve an MLLMs spatial competence. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Bench, multiple-choice VQA benchmark dedicated to MultiiMage-based Spatial Intelligence (Figure 1). MMSI-Bench is built on comprehensive taxonomy of ten fundamental spatial reasoning tasks that span the positions, attributes, and motions of three key elementscamera, object, and region in real-world scenes. Beyond these atomic tasks, we construct multi-step reasoning split that chains them into long-horizon questions. Crafting benchmark that is simultaneously diverse, accurate, and challenging is far from trivial. Prior benchmarks [15, 17, 65, 22] populate templated questions from annotated or estimated spatial metadata. These automatic pipelines suffer from limited diversity and incomplete coverage. We therefore adopt fully human-centric design. For each question, one of six 3D-vision researchers scours large image collections, selects set of images that exhibit non-trivial spatial relations, and creates novel, difficult, and unambiguous multiple-choice question whose answer can be derived only by reasoning across all selected images. Every item comes with carefully designed distractors and step-by-step reasoning process that explicitly leads to the correct answer; second annotator then audits each example to ensure clarity and correctness. Over the course of 300+ researcher-hours, we inspected more than 120,000 candidate images and distilled them into 1,000 high-quality Q&A pairs covering broad spectrum of real-world scenesfrom indoor scans [18, 14] and outdoor driving footage [54, 13] to robot manipulation [9] and everyday activities [23]. We evaluate 34 widely used MLLMs on MMSI-Bench. The strongest open-source model attains about 30% accuracy, while the best proprietary system, the OpenAI o3 model [46] with reasoning mode, reaches only 40%, compared with human performance at 97% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, MMSI-Bench shows the largest performance margin between state-of-the-art models and humans among existing spatial intelligence benchmarks. This pronounced gap underscores both the difficulty of MMSI-Bench and the headroom for progress in spatial intelligence. Our error analysis groups failures into four categories: (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors. Because every question is paired with reference reasoning process, we also release novel automated analysis pipeline that contrasts models response with the reference to pinpoint error types efficiently across the entire benchmark, providing actionable insights for future work on multi-image spatial intelligence."

            "content": "Multi-image VQA benchmarks. Driven by the rapid progress of MLLMs, VQA benchmarks have shifted from single-image reasoning [25] to multi-image settings focusing on various skills. Visual Haystacks [60] probes long-context retrieval, asking models to locate relevant content within large image collections. MIBench [36] stresses cross-image reasoning that combines instruction following with knowledge retrieval. ReMI [28] broadens the scope to math, physics, and code across two to six images, blending GPT-generated items with human audits. BLINK [22] zeroes in on inter-image relationships, while MuirBench [57] adds robustness and diversity to multi-image reasoning. Existing benchmarks show that contemporary MLLMs still trail behind humans as either the number of images or the reasoning complexity grows [31]. In this work, instead of building general benchmark, we focus on comprehensively evaluating MLLMs multi-image spatial intelligence. 2 Benchmarks for spatial intelligence of MLLMs. Recent progress in MLLMs has enabled them to potentially serve as the brains of embodied agents, e.g., the decision-making modules of autonomous vehicles [53] or robots [29, 12, 32], where reliable spatial intelligence is indispensable. To measure this capability, variety of benchmarks have been proposed, but the majority assess only single-image spatial understanding [33, 66, 52, 34, 27, 20, 56, 49, 39]. Beyond single view, associating information across multiple images is even more critical in practice, yet existing multi-image benchmarks remain fragmentary. BLINK [22] and MuriBench [57] contain just few spatial sub-splits within otherwise general VQA suites, and thus lack comprehensive coverage. LEGO-Puzzles [55] probes multi-step reasoning in synthetic LEGO-assembly setting, overlooking real-world scenes. Efforts such as UniQA-3D [68], MMIU [40], SAT [50], MultiSPA [63], and VSI-Bench [65] generate template-based or rule-based questions from existing annotations/metadata or simulators, which constrains question diversity. By contrast, our MMSI-Bench is fully humancurated, free from template limitations, contains challenging and diverse questions, and offers rigorous evaluation of MLLMs spatial intelligence in multi-image scenarios."

            "content": "In this section, we present MMSI-Bench, comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-image spatial reasoning capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce the concept of multi-image spatial reasoning and outlines its associated sub-tasks in Section 3.1. Subsequently, in Section 3.2, we provide detailed description of the benchmark construction process. 3.1 Overview of MMSI-Bench Humans possess the remarkable ability to infer spatial information about their environment by integrating visual inputs from different viewpoints or moments in time. We refer to this process as multi-image spatial reasoning, in which information from multiple images is combined to reconstruct the underlying scene and enable reasoning to answer complex spatial questions. To evaluate the multiimage spatial reasoning capability of multimodal large language models, we introduce MMSI-Bench. To systematically evaluate multi-image spatial reasoning, we categorize tasks based on three fundamental spatial elements: camera (the agent that captures the scenes), object (entities other than the agent within the scenes), and region (semantic areas within the scenes, such as kitchen). Fundamental spatial understanding requires not only recognizing the positional relationships among these elements but also their attributes and potential motion. Guided by this taxonomy, we define ten spatial reasoning task types and one multi-step spatial reasoning category, which flexibly combines these basic types. Examples for all task categories are provided in Figure 2. Notably, our questions are designed to be human-answerable; thus, we do not include questions about camera attributes (parameters). Additionally, since regions are generally static, we do not include motion-related tasks for regions. The specific categories are as follows: Positional Relationship (camera-camera): Inferring the positional relationship between two camera viewpoints. Positional Relationship (camera-object): Identifying the positional relationship between the camera and an object. Positional Relationship (camera-region): Assessing the positional relationship between the camera and semantic region (e.g., kitchen). Positional Relationship (object-object): Inferring the positional relationship between objects within the scenes. Positional Relationship (object-region): Determining the positional relationship between an object and semantic region. Positional Relationship (region-region): Identifying the positional relationship between different regions within given scene. Attribute Measurement: Inferring geometric properties (e.g., length, size) of elements. Attribute Appearance: Inferring visual characteristics of elements, such as their shape. Motion (camera): Reasoning about the cameras movement, such as its movement direction. 3 Figure 2: Representative MMSI-Bench samples from each category. Please zoom in to inspect image details. Questions and rationales are simplified for brevity; the complete versions appear in the supplementary material. Correct answers are highlighted in green. Motion (object): Assessing the movement of objects within the scene. Multi-Step Reasoning: Solving complex tasks that require multiple sequential steps of the spatial reasoning types described above. In conclusion, MMSI-Bench consists of 1,000 multiple-choice questionanswer pairs based on multiple images, each also accompanied by annotated reasoning processes explaining the answer. Every question is specifically designed such that it cannot be answered using single image alone. Except for the Multi-Step Reasoning category, all other categories contain only two images per question. Detailed statistics on the proportion of questions in each category and other relevant information about MMSI-Bench are presented in Figure 4 and Table 1, respectively. 3.2 Benchmark Construction Process Our detailed benchmark construction process is illustrated in Figure 3. Data collection. To comprehensively evaluate the capability of MLLMs across variety of realworld scenarios, it is essential to curate data from diverse and representative sources. To ensure the complexity and authenticity of the evaluation, we exclusively utilize images captured from real-world scenes. Accordingly, we leverage images from diverse collection of real-world datasets: indoor 3D 4 Figure 3: Illustration of the MMSI-Bench construction pipeline: images are collected from diverse real-world datasets, relevant image sets are carefully selected, complex QA tasks and detailed reasoning processes are manually annotated, and all data undergo rigorous quality control.

Figure 4: Distribution of categories in MMSI-Bench. Table 1: Dataset statistics. scene datasets (ScanNet [18] and Matterport3D [14]), local scene reconstruction dataset (DTU [26]), autonomous driving datasets (nuScenes [13], Waymo [54]), robotics dataset (AgiBot-World [9]), video object segmentation dataset (DAVIS 2017 [48]), and an egocentric video dataset (Ego4D [23]). These diverse data sources enable the construction of various question-answer pairs, ensuring that our benchmark captures the complexity and diversity inherent in real-world environments. Question-answer design and reasoning process Annotation. Based on the collected datasets, six 3D Vision researchers annotate QA pairs spanning the above eleven distinct task categories (with each category allocated to all six annotators). Annotators are explicitly instructed to create diverse set of questions that are as novel and as challenging as possible for MLLMs, aiming to push the boundaries of current model capabilities. At the same time, annotators are instructed to ensure that all questions are accurate, unambiguous, and answerable by humans. For each question, annotators begin by visually inspecting the image database to choose set of relevant images. They then construct question that cannot be answered based on any single image in isolation; rather, the question requires integrating information from multiple images in order to infer the actual scenario. To ensure diversity in question formats, no templates are used, and all questions are created in free form. Each question is designed as four-option multiple-choice problem, with only one correct answer. The incorrect options are also carefully crafted to serve as plausible distractors. In addition, annotators provide detailed reasoning processes alongside each answer, which are used to facilitate filtering incorrect samples during quality control and to enable automated evaluation and analysis of MLLMs reasoning processes, as described in Section 5.2. 5 Positional Relationship Attribute Motion Cam.Cam.Obj.Obj.

            "content": "4.1 Evaluation Setup Benchmark models. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of wide range of MLLMs, encompassing both proprietary and open-source families, diverse model scales, and recent architectural advances. For proprietary models, our benchmark includes o3 [46], GPT-4.5 [45], GPT-4.1 [44], GPT4o[43], Gemini-2.5-Pro [19] (with and without Thinking mode), Claude-3.7-Sonnet [10] (with and without Thinking mode), Doubao-1.5-pro [51], and Seed1.5-VL [24]. On the open-source side, we systematically assess state-of-the-art models such as Qwen2.5-VL [11], LLaVA-OneVision [30], InternVL3 [67], InternVL2.5 [16], DeepSeek-VL2 [61], Llama-3.2-11B-Vision [41], and NVILA [37]. Baselines. For comparison, we include three baselines: Random Guessing, Human Performance, and Blind GPT-4o. Random Guessing reflects the expected accuracy under equal-probability selec6 tion from all options. Human performance is measured as the average accuracy of five independent evaluators not involved in data annotation, representing human-level spatial intelligence on this benchmark. Blind GPT-4o denotes the performance of GPT-4o without access to image inputs. Implementation details. We report accuracy (%) using exact match between answers extracted from model outputs and ground-truth answers for our multiple-choice questions. If model fails to generate an answer in the required format, we adopt the LLM-based fallback strategy from VLMEvalKit [21] to extract the intended response. For consistency, all models are evaluated with temperature of zero and maximum output length of 2,048 tokens. 4.2 Main Results Table 2 presents the primary results of our evaluation, covering both proprietary and open-source models, as well as the baselines of Random Guessing, Human Performance, and Blind GPT-4o. We summarize our main findings as follows: Current MLLMs struggle with multi-image spatial reasoning. Despite recent progress, even the most advanced MLLMs exhibit significant limitations in multi-image spatial reasoning. Most models achieve relatively low average scores, often only marginally outperforming random guessing, and are far from human-level performance. For example, the best-performing proprietary reasoning model, o3, achieves an average accuracy of only 41.0%, while human performance exceeds 97%, highlighting substantial gap in spatial intelligence between current MLLMs and humans. Furthermore, we find that employing the \"thinking\" mode in models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet brings only limited improvements, suggesting that these models potentially lack strong spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, the accuracy of Blind GPT-4o is close to that of random guessing, indicating that our tasks indeed require genuine visual-spatial reasoning and cannot be solved by language priors or commonsense knowledge alone. Advanced open-source models still trail proprietary counterparts. We observe that leading open-source models generally underperform compared to proprietary models. For instance, the best open-source model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, achieves an average score of 30.7%, which is notably lower than that of the top proprietary model. This underscores notable performance gap between cutting-edge open-source and proprietary MLLMs on this challenging benchmark. Multi-step reasoning and camera motion comprehension are challenging. For most models, performance on multi-step reasoning (MSR) tasks is lower than on single-step tasks (i.e., the average performance on Positional Relationship, Attribute, and Motion categories), indicating that integrating information across multiple reasoning steps remains challenge for current MLLMs. In addition, most models, particularly open-source ones, perform poorly on camera motion tasks, suggesting that MLLMs, as embodied agents, struggle to understand their own movement. One potential reason is that open-source models generally lack access to annotated first-person motion data during training, while proprietary models may leverage more diverse datasets containing such information. Scaling up model size brings limited gains on MMSI-Bench. We observe that, for models within the same series, increasing the number of parameters leads to only limited performance gains on MMSI-Bench. For example, Qwen2.5-VL-72B achieves only 3% higher accuracy than Qwen2.5VL-32B, and InternVL3-78B outperforms InternVL3-1B by just 1.5%. Moreover, NVILA-15B surpasses most models with over 70 billion parameters, ranking second only to the best-performing open-source model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B. These results suggest that, at present, the bottleneck for advancing MLLM performance on complex spatial reasoning tasks may lie primarily in data quality and diversity, rather than model size. How to best leverage data, model size, and architecture in synergy remains an open and important question for future research. 4.3 Limited Effect of Prompting Techniques on MMSI-Bench Prompting techniques are widely adopted to improve the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large models. Building on these advances, we investigate whether such methods can similarly enhance the spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs on MMSI-Bench. Specifically, we investigate both linguistic and visual prompting approaches (see supplementary material for further details): 7 Linguistic prompting: We adopt the widely used Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. Following prior work [59], we prepend Lets think step by step to the prompts to encourage reasoning. Visual prompting: For multi-image spatial understanding, fundamental requirement is the ability to identify overlaps between images in order to establish relationships across them. However, MLLMs may struggle to identify overlaps between images. To explicitly provide this cue to the model, we employ the popular image matching method PATS [42] to establish sparse correspondences between pairs of images, which involves concatenating multiple images and drawing lines between corresponding points to explicitly indicate cross-image relationships. As baseline, we use concatenated images without correspondence lines as visual inputs, and compare their results with those obtained using visual prompt. We conduct experiments using representative models, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, LLaVA-OneVision-72B, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B. As shown in Figure 5, the linguistic prompting approach (CoT) leads to modest performance improvement only for GPT-4o, while resulting to performance degradation on the other models. This limited effectiveness of linguistic prompting may be attributed to the models inherent lack of spatial reasoning capabilities; simply encouraging \"thinking\" does not address their fundamental limitations in spatial understandinga finding consistent with the observation that adopting \"thinking\" mode in models like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-3.7Sonnet does not yield performance gains either. The particularly pronounced negative impact for LLaVA-OneVision may be due to its limited exposure to multimodal reasoning data during training, which makes it struggle with complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Figure 5: Impact of linguistic and visual prompting on MMSI-Bench. Similarly, the visual prompting approach yields only slight performance improvements for two models, while resulting in performance degradation for the other two. One possible explanation is that most models still lack the basic spatial intelligence required to benefit from such cues: they may not recognize the need to identify overlaps between images to establish spatial relationships, or, even when overlaps are identified, they struggle to reconstruct the actual scene. These findings indicate that further progress in the spatial reasoning ability of MLLMs may depend on advances in model architectures or training paradigms, such as the incorporation of domain-specific data, rather than relying solely on improved prompting strategies."

            "title": "5 Error Analysis",
            "content": "This section analyzes the errors made by MLLMs on MMSI-Bench. First, Section 5.1 presents manual categorization of error types observed in the reasoning processes of the representative model. Then, in Section 5.2, we introduce an enhanced automated error analysis method for systematically examining the reasoning errors of various MLLMs with the help of our annotated reasoning processes. 5.1 Error Type Categorization To identify the main bottlenecks of MLLMs on our benchmark, we manually analyze the reasoning processes exhibited by representative model, GPT-4o, when prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions. Specifically, we randomly sample 100 instances from MMSI-Bench and categorize the observed errors into four distinct types (as illustrated in Figure 6): Grounding errors. The model fails to correctly identify or localize relevant objects or details within the image. For instance, it might misclassify an object or incorrectly determine the position of an objecterrors that undermine its ability to anchor visual reasoning in the actual image content. Overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors. The model fails to identify and match corresponding points that represent the same locations or objects in the real scene across different images, and struggles to implicitly reconstruct the underlying scene based on these cross-image relationships. Figure 6: Illustration of four error types identified in MLLM spatial reasoning on MMSI-Bench. Figure 7: Distribution of correct and error types across three representative MLLMs. For example, it may be unable to recognize that tree appearing in both images is actually the same tree, leading to an incorrect reconstruction of the scene layout. Situation-transformation reasoning errors. The model makes mistakes when reasoning about spatial directions relative to different reference objects, or when converting between relative directions (such as left and right) and absolute directions (such as north, south, east, and west), leading to incorrect situational inferences. Spatial-logic errors. The model exhibits errors in spatial logical reasoning, such as (1) hallucinating spatial relationships that do not exist in the given context; (2) failing to correctly apply the transitivity of spatial relationsfor example, given that is east of and is east of C, the model incorrectly infers that is west of C; and (3) making mistakes in identifying the correct reference object during motion reasoning, such as using another moving object as the reference point when determining an objects movement status (whereas the correct approach would be to use stationary object like the ground as the reference). 5.2 Automated Error Analysis The manually annotated reasoning processes that we provide, in addition to facilitating quality assurance, have other potential uses, such as serving as training data to improve the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs [15, 64]. However, as our work focuses on evaluation benchmarks, how to scalably collect such data for training remains an open question for future work. Here, we demonstrate another important application: enabling automated error analysis. 9 Specifically, we leverage the reasoning processes generated by GPT-4o on randomly sampled data, as described in Section 5.1. By providing GPT-4o with both the ground-truth answers and the humanannotated reasoning steps, we prompt it to simultaneously assess the correctness of the MLLMs reasoning process and, if incorrect, identify the key error type responsible. For comparison, we assess the MLLMs reasoning processes by identifying the most critical error type responsible for each incorrect case. Ultimately, this automated error analysis closely aligns with human evaluators judgments, with 71.8% of classifications matching when human-annotated reasoning steps are available. In contrast, when these annotated reasoning steps are not provided and only the groundtruth answers are given, only 53.6% of classifications match human evaluators judgments, indicating that correct answers alone are insufficient for effectively assisting the model in evaluating the reasoning process. This highlights the important role of high-quality human annotations in achieving reliable automated error analysis. We then apply this approach to analyze the reasoning processes of representative models across all MMSI-Bench questions, with results presented in Figure 7, which reveals the distribution of error types across different models and highlights specific directions for improving their spatial reasoning abilities. Notably, we observe that even when the final answer is correct, the reasoning process can still contain significant errors. Among the various error types, overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors account for the largest proportion of mistakes across all models. This suggests clear direction for future progress as MLLMs strive for human-level spatial intelligence."

Additional Case Studies (Section G): We provide further case studies to illustrate the models reasoning process on MMSI-Bench, supplementing those already discussed in the main text. 10 Each section is intended to provide additional transparency and insight, ensuring the reproducibility and broader contextualization of our research. Limitations, Social Impact, and License & Access B.1 Limitation In developing MMSI-Bench, we opted for manual annotation of question-answer pairs to ensure higher data quality and richer content. While this approach leads to more challenging and diverse benchmarks, it inevitably introduces scalability limitations, as expanding the dataset requires significant human effort. Additionally, during the manual annotation process, we intentionally avoided rigid templates to encourage greater variety and naturalness in the dataset. Although this results in richer and more realistic set of questions, it also makes it more challenging to precisely control the difficulty level across all items. Despite these inherent trade-offs, we believe that our annotation strategy enables MMSI-Bench to better reflect the complexities of real-world spatial reasoning, and will serve as valuable resource for advancing research in vision-language understanding. B.2 Broader Impact The introduction of MMSI-Bench brings both potential benefits and risks to the research community and broader society. On the positive side, MMSI-Bench provides challenging and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. By facilitating more nuanced and rigorous assessment, MMSI-Bench may help drive advances in embodied AI, assistive technologies, spatial robotics, and other domains where spatial understanding is critical. However, we also recognize several risks and challenges associated with the development and release of such datasets. First, improvements in spatial reasoning enabled by MMSI-Bench may have unintended applications, such as enhanced surveillance or automated decision-making systems that could impact privacy or disproportionately affect certain groups. We encourage users of MMSI-Bench to adhere strictly to ethical guidelines and to consider the societal implications of deploying models benchmarked using our dataset. From an environmental perspective, we acknowledge the significant computational resources required to evaluate modern vision-language models. By releasing MMSI-Bench and its associated scripts publicly, we aim to promote reproducibility and reduce redundant efforts, thereby minimizing unnecessary environmental impact. In summary, while MMSI-Bench is intended to advance responsible and transparent research in spatial reasoning for vision-language models, we urge the community to remain vigilant regarding both its positive and negative societal impacts. We are committed to updating and improving MMSI-Bench in response to constructive feedback, and we welcome ongoing dialogue to help identify and mitigate emerging risks.

Some benchmarks contain QA pairs outside spatial understanding; the number of spatial QA is shown in parentheses. Human-AI performance gap is defined as the accuracy difference between the best-performing model reported in the corresponding paper and human performance; for benchmarks without reported human results, the gap is calculated with respect to 100% accuracy and is marked as <value%. Note: Scenario entries labeled as Indoor & Outdoor or Indoor refer to real-world images. Despite significant advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), robust evaluation of their spatial intelligenceespecially in multi-image, real-world scenariosremains limited. As summarized in Table 3, most existing benchmarks focus narrowly on single-image spatial understanding or offer only limited multi-image coverage as minor components within more general VQA suites (e.g., BLINK [22], MuriBench [57]), rather than serving as dedicated spatial reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, several datasets rely heavily on templateor rule-based question generation [50, 68, 40, 65], which restricts both the diversity and depth of spatial reasoning challenges. Synthetic settings such as LEGO-Puzzle [55] further lack the complexity and contextual richness of real-world environments. In contrast, MMSI-Bench is fully human-curated benchmark, meticulously annotated by six 3D vision researchers without the use of templates. It offers comprehensive coverage of spatial relationships and elementsincluding camera (agent), objects, and regionsacross ten well-defined task types plus one multi-step reasoning category. All scenarios derive from diverse, real-world sources, spanning indoor 3D scene datasets, local scene reconstructions, autonomous driving datasets, and robotics data, encompassing both indoor and outdoor environments. Notably, MMSI-Bench provides detailed, human-authored reasoning chains for each question, enabling rigorous assessment of both answer accuracy and reasoning quality. This benchmark reveals substantial gap between current MLLMs and human-level spatial intelligence, and sets higher standard for multi-image spatial reasoning evaluation in realistic settings."

E.2 Data Annotation and Quality Control Interfaces The interfaces for data annotation and quality control are illustrated in Figure 12 and Figure 13, respectively.

For quality control, reviewers can choose to discard data entry if any issues are identified, providing the reason for rejection; otherwise, they can approve and retain the data. E.3 General Guidelines MMSI-Bench is designed to systematically evaluate the multi-image spatial reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using human-readable questions. The following guidelines govern the data annotation process: Human-Centric Design: All questions and answer choices are formulated in natural, human-readable English, avoiding technical prompts such as direct requests for camera parameters. Image Requirement: Every question is constructed so that it cannot be answered using single image alone; the information required to answer must be synthesized from multiple images. Question Type and Format: All questions are multiple-choice with four options, only one of which is correct. Questions are created in free form (no templates) to ensure diversity and challenge for MLLMs. Category Coverage: Each question is assigned to one of eleven categories, covering positional relationships, attributes, motion, and multi-step reasoning among cameras, objects, and regions. This taxonomy is designed to comprehensively span the space of fundamental spatial reasoning types. Difficulty, Diversity, and Clarity: Questions must be of high difficulty, unambiguous, and answerable by humans. Annotators are encouraged to maximize diversity in question design and avoid repetitive patterns. Annotations must be accurate, consistent, and adhere to high standard of academic rigor. Ethics and Licensing: All images and question sources must comply with copyright and licensing restrictions. Annotators must not use material from sources that prohibit redistribution. Reasoning Process Annotation: For each question, annotators provide detailed step-bystep reasoning process, documenting the logical path from the images to the answer. 18 E.4 Data Format and Structure To ensure consistency and facilitate reliable evaluation and analysis, all benchmark entries conform to standardized data structure: JSON Format: Each question-answer pair is stored as JSON object, with fields for question text, four answer options, the correct answer index, category, difficulty, image paths, and annotated reasoning process. Image Files: All referenced images are stored separately and linked via file paths in the JSON entries. Field Completeness: Each entry must have all fields completed: question, answer, category, image list, and reasoning process. Multi-Image Structure: Except for the Multi-Step Reasoning category, every question is associated with exactly two images. Multi-Step Reasoning samples may include more images according to task complexity. Final Storage Format: For efficient downloading and usage, the entire datasetincluding binary-encoded images and metadatais stored in the Parquet format. E.5 Quality Control and Validation rigorous multi-stage quality control procedure is implemented to ensure the reliability and validity of the benchmark: Independent Review: All annotated samples are independently reviewed by three expert reviewers who were not involved in the original annotation process. Error and Ambiguity Filtering: Reviewers systematically remove or revise questions exhibiting insufficient visual information, ambiguity (linguistic or visual), incorrect answers, or vague/incomplete reasoning processes. Non-Triviality Check: Samples that can be answered using single image or general common sense (rather than spatial reasoning across images) are excluded. Iterative Feedback: Annotators receive feedback on problematic items and are required to revise or replace such entries. Final Audit: Only questions passing all review stages are included in the benchmark, ensuring high data quality and robust evaluation. Representative MMSI-Bench Samples from Each Category (Full Version) For clarity and readability, questions and rationales in the main text are simplified; the complete versions for each category are provided in this section. We present one full example for each of the 11 categories: Position (Camera-Camera), Position (Camera-Object), Position (Camera-Region), Position (Object-Object), Position (Object-Region), Position (Region-Region), Motion (Camera), Motion (Object), Attribute (Measurement), Attribute (Appearance), and Multi-Step Reasoning. These representative samples are illustrated in Figures 1424."
