            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across diverse application domains, demonstrating strong performance in language understanding [24, 43], reasoning [25, 44], and structured problem-solving [39, 40]. These capabilities have motivated their adoption as assistants for decision-making and recommendation tasks [7, 9, 15, 18, 19]. In most recommendation benchmarks, personalization is primarily measured by behavioral imitation: recommendation is deemed correct if it matches what user would click, rate, or choose [6, 14, 16, 28]. This behavior-centric paradigm is effective in many consumer domains, where feedback is reliable proxy for utility. Financial recommendation is different. Investor actions are often affected by short-term market noise, emotions, and shifting constraints, and may deviate from stable risk tolerance or long-term objectives [1, 22]. As result, matching historical choices alone cannot tell whether an advisor is providing good financial guidance. faithful mimic of noisy actions may be misaligned with the users Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yan et al. representative user-centric Table 1: Comparison of recommendation benchmarks. Dynamic indicates timeconditioned signals; Utility refers to relevance grounded in user-dependent decision utility; Multi-view indicates multiple, potentially conflicting ranking views; Dialogue denotes conversational interactive setting. Work Domain Dynamic Utility Multi-view Dialogue REASONER [6] FairEval [28] PerFairX [27] CEREAL [14] LLM-REDIAL [16] RecBench [18] FAR-Trans [29] Ours Video Music Movie&Music Movie Movie General Finance Finance (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:34) (cid:34) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:34) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:34) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:34) (cid:34) (cid:37) (cid:37) (cid:34) underlying goals, while purely rational advisor may ignore user intent and preferences. Existing benchmarks, as summarized in Table 1, therefore struggle with three issues: behavior-as-truth, utility blindness, and singleview evaluation. Most user-centric benchmarks rely on relevance signals (clicks/ratings) [6, 18] without utility grounding, while finance datasets often emphasize prediction or trading objectives rather than user-specific decision quality [29]. Consequently, they cannot diagnose whether an LLM advisor is reasoning about risksensitive utility, blindly chasing market trends, or simply overfitting user noise. To address this gap, we introduce Conv-FinRe, the first conversational and longitudinal benchmark that formulates financial recommendation as multi-view alignment problem. Rather than evaluating whether an LLM simply matches user choices, the benchmark assesses model rankings against four complementary reference views, such as user choice (𝑦𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟 ), rational utility (𝑦𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙 ), market momentum (𝑦𝑚𝑜𝑚), and risk sensitivity (𝑦𝑠𝑎𝑓 𝑒 ), enabling diagnosis of whether model relies on rational analysis, behavioral imitation, or short-term market signals. To support such evaluation, userspecific risk preferences are inferred from longitudinal decision trajectories via inverse optimization and used to construct utilityand risk-based reference rankings, without exposing the latent utility function to the model. Operationally, Conv-FinRe instantiates the task through onboarding interviews and step-wise advisory dialogues, where an LLM must reconcile competing advisory principles over time. We evaluate diverse set of state-of-the-art LLMs under ConvFinRe and reveal fundamental tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment. While some models achieve strong utility-based rankings, they often conflate long-term risk with short-term market momentum; conversely, domain-specialized models tend to overfit noisy user actions, mistaking transient behavior for stable preferences. Together, these results motivate ConvFinRe as benchmark for multi-view, utility-grounded evaluation. We make the following contributions: (1) We introduce ConvFinRe, conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavioral imitation by grounding assessment in investor-specific utility. (2) We formulate financial recommendation evaluation as multi-view alignment problem and provide diagnostic framework, supported by inverse optimization, that disentangles behavioral alignment from rational decision quality. (3) We conduct systematic evaluation of stateof-the-art LLMs under Conv-FinRe, identifying distinct advisory behavior patterns under competing market signals and user noise."

            "content": "Personalized recommendation benchmarks are well studied in consumer domains such as e-commerce and media, where personalization is typically modeled from interaction histories or coarse user traits and supervision relies on single relevance signal like ratings or clicks [6, 42]. Recent work enriches this setting by introducing structured explanations [6] and by evaluating LLMs either as representation enhancers or as end-to-end recommenders under point-wise, pair-wise, or list-wise protocols [7, 9, 18, 19], with further analysis of fairness, bias, and sequential alignment [17, 28]. In contrast, personalized stock recommendation poses additional challenges due to non-stationary assets and investor objectives constrained by risk tolerance and returnrisk trade-offs [29, 34], with evidence that risk preferences evolve and must be inferred from behavior rather than static profiles [5]. While conversational and LLM-based financial advisors enable iterative preference elicitation [10, 23, 30, 33, 35, 36], existing benchmarks rarely evaluate recommendation quality using investor-specific utility as the core supervision signal, limiting their ability to assess true decision alignment."

Unlike conventional recommendation benchmarks that rely on single \"gold-standard\" label, our task evaluates LLM alignment across four complementary reference views: User Choice (𝑦𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟 ), representing the empirical selections made by the human participant; Rational Utility (𝑦𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙 ), an idealized ranking derived from calibrated utility function that represents the theoretically optimal balance between return and risk; Market Momentum (𝑦𝑚𝑜𝑚), profit-oriented ranking based purely on recent cumulative returns; and Risk Sensitivity (𝑦𝑠𝑎𝑓 𝑒 ), conservative ranking that isolates the users specific risk-avoidance component by penalizing volatility and downside risk according to their inferred sensitivity. In this setting, the LLM acts as Personalized Investment Advisor whose objective is not explicitly specified. Instead, the model must infer the users latent financial preferences over time and reconcile conflicting advisory principles. At each decision step, the model is presented with the current market context, historical interaction trajectory, and recommendations from panel of three specialized advisors grounded in 𝑦𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙 , 𝑦𝑚𝑜𝑚, and 𝑦𝑠𝑎𝑓 𝑒 . The core challenge for the LLM is to synthesize these heterogeneous signals to produce final ranking that reflects its inferred understanding of the users underlying financial objectives. This multi-view design enables us to diagnose whether an LLMs misalignment with actual user behavior stems from an over-reliance on market momentum or miscalculation of the users specific risk thresholds. Formally, for the user 𝑖 at step 𝑡, given candidate stock set S𝑡 𝑡 , the recommendation process is defined as: and decision context I𝑖 𝜋𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑓𝜃 (I𝑖 𝑡 , S𝑡 ), (1) where 𝑓𝜃 denotes the evaluated LLM-based advisor, 𝜋𝑖,𝑡 is the reranked list from the S𝑡 . Specifically, the decision context I𝑖 𝑡 is shown below: 𝑡 = (cid:0)𝑃𝑖, 𝑖 I𝑖 , M𝑡 (cid:1) , 1:𝑡 (2) where 𝑃𝑖 denotes the onboarding dialogue, multi-turn introductory interaction used to elicit the user 𝑖s background, financial goals, and initial risk tolerance. M𝑡 = {v𝑠,𝑡 , x𝑠,𝑡 }𝑠 S𝑡 represents the current market state. Here, v𝑠,𝑡 = (𝜇𝑠, 𝜎 2 𝑠 , Drawdown𝑠 ) denotes the vector of raw performance metrics used for preference grounding, while x𝑠,𝑡 comprises the verbalized market signals (e.g., price trends, percentage returns, and volatility) presented to the LLM advisor. The term 𝑖 1:𝑡 1 encapsulates the longitudinal interaction trajectory, consisting of multi-turn dialogues between the user and the three specialized advisors (Rational Utility, Market Momentum, and Risk Sensitivity). This history provides the model with both the users previous decision patterns and the conflicting advisory signals previously encountered."

Instead, to enable principled analysis of advisory behaviors, we construct latent preference signal that serves as reference representation of each users underlying risk attitude. This preference signal is used to characterize advisory objectives within the benchmark, rather than being exposed to the model. We assume that user 𝑖s decision-making process is governed , which balances expected return by latent utility function 𝑈 (𝑠 ) 𝑖,𝑡 against volatility and downside risk [20, 26, 38]. For user 𝑖 and stock 𝑠 S𝑡 at step 𝑡, the utility is defined as: 𝑈 (𝑠 ) 𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜇𝑠,𝑡 𝜆𝑖 𝜎 2 𝑠,𝑡 𝛾𝑖 Drawdown𝑠,𝑡 , (3) 𝑠,𝑡 , and where 𝜇𝑠,𝑡 , 𝜎 2 Drawdown𝑠,𝑡 denote the cross-sectionally standardized mean return, variance, and maximum drawdown of stock 𝑠 over 7-day window preceding step 𝑡. (𝜆𝑖, 𝛾𝑖 ) are the user-specific parameters, which are assumed to be time-invariant and capture the users sensitivity to volatility and downside risk. We estimate (𝜆𝑖, 𝛾𝑖 ) via Inverse Optimization [3, 4] using the users longitudinal behavioral trajectory 𝐻 𝑖 1:𝑇 . Assuming rational choice model with Gumbel-distributed noise, the probability that user 𝑖 selects stock 𝑠 at step 𝑡 follows Multinomial Logit model [32]: 𝑃 (𝑠 𝜆𝑖, 𝛾𝑖, M𝑡 ) = exp (cid:17) (cid:16) 𝑈 (𝑠 ) 𝑖,𝑡 (cid:16) 𝑈 (𝑠 ) 𝑖,𝑡 (cid:205)𝑠 S𝑡 exp , (cid:17) (4) The global parameters are obtained by minimizing the Regularized Negative Log-Likelihood [2, 21] over the interaction horizon: L𝑖 (𝜆𝑖, 𝛾𝑖 ) = 𝑇 𝑡 = log 𝑃 (cid:0)𝑠 𝑖,𝑡 𝜆𝑖, 𝛾𝑖, M𝑡 (cid:1) + 𝛼 (𝜆𝑖, 𝛾𝑖 )2 2 , (𝜆𝑖, 𝛾𝑖 ) = arg min 𝜆𝑖 ,𝛾𝑖 L𝑖 . (5) (6) 𝑖,𝑡 is the stock actually chosen by user 𝑖 at step 𝑡, and 𝛼 where 𝑠 controls the strength of regularization. Once (𝜆𝑖, 𝛾𝑖 ) are estimated, we construct the reference views for evaluation.

User interaction data are collected through two-stage protocol. First, we obtain static user profiles from 10 participants via structured questionnaire4 capturing investor demographics, financial capacity, investment experience, and risk attitudes. The questionnaire design follows regulatory suitability guidelines (MiFID II Article 255; FINRA Rule 21116) and is informed by Betterments approach7 on investor risk preferences and financial decision-making; and industry examples, such as JPMorgan Financial Health Check8, Charles Schwab Investor Risk Profile9, Vanguard Investor Financial Profile10, and Financial Group Plan11. Second, we collect longitudinal decision trajectories using custom asset simulation tool. Participants interact with fixed universe of ten stocks over 30-day horizon, observing daily and intraday price movements. At each step, users make incremental buy decisions and receive portfolio-level feedback, including realized returns and volatility, which is logged together with their actions to form temporally ordered interaction trace. The simulation tool is publicly released for reproducibility12. 3.3.2 Conversation Simulation. Conversation Generation. Building on the collected user interaction data, we construct structured conversation simulation to instantiate the proposed longitudinal advisory task in languagebased setting. Rather than collecting free-form dialogues from participants, we transform each users observed profile and behavioral trajectory into coherent multi-turn advisory conversation, enabling controlled and reproducible evaluation of LLMs. Each user trajectory is organized into two phases: an onboarding interview and longitudinal advisory dialogue over fixed horizon 𝑇 . The onboarding phase verbalizes the static user profile obtained from the questionnaire. Using the users survey responses as grounding signals, we generate four-turn advisoruser dialogue that captures the users financial background, constraints, investment 4https://forms.gle/g7GnwqByq7mCoJgTA 5https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2014/65/oj/ 6https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2111 7https://d-nb.info/116404222X 8https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/asiapacific/hk/en/literature/ account-forms/healthcheck_corporate.pdf 9https://www.studocu.vn/vn/document/royal-melbourne-institute-of-technologyvietnam/international-trade/charles-schwab-investor-risk-profile/100562992 10https://sustainableinvest.com/wp-content/uploads/Investor-Financial-ProfileQuestionnaire.pdf 11https://financialgroup.com/risk-profile-bq 12https://huggingface.co/spaces/TheFinAI/LetYourProfitsRun Table 3: Structural statistics of Conv-FinRe benchmark.

The generated language is constrained to match the users reported financial literacy, ensuring that preference signals are conveyed implicitly through natural expression rather than explicit financial terminology. This onboarding dialogue serves as the conversational realization of 𝑃𝑖 in the decision context I𝑖 𝑡 .

At each step 𝑡, the conversation conditions on the historical interaction trajectory 𝑖 1:𝑡 1 and the current market state M𝑡 , represented by 7-day market snapshot derived from the simulation environment. panel of three specialized advisors provides recommendations based on the heterogeneous principles defined in our multi-view framework: Rational-Utility, MarketMomentum, and Risk-Sensitivity strategies. The user then finalizes choice, potentially deviating from advisor suggestions and providing subjective justification consistent with their observed behavior in the simulation. All advisor messages and user responses are appended to the conversation history, yielding temporally ordered dialogue aligned with the underlying interaction trace. Overall, as shown in Table 3, the benchmark contains 10 users and 230 prefix-conditioned instances. Dialogue context grows from 4 to 26 turns (15 on average), yielding 270 unique turns that expand to 3,450 prefix-conditioned turns. Each instance contains 1,8187,252 tokens (4,320.2 on average), highlighting the substantial longitudinal context complexity required for evaluation. Conversation Quality Validation. We validate the quality of the simulated conversations from both preference-grounding and conversational realism perspective. User Preference Consistency Validation: For each user 𝑖, the inferred latent parameters (𝜆𝑖, 𝛾𝑖 ) represent the users sensitivity to volatility and downside risk. To assess whether these parameters meaningfully capture the users true investment psychology, financial experts translate each parameter pair into concise naturallanguage summary of the users risk tolerance. Users are then asked to rate, on 09 Likert scale (0 = not at all accurate, 9 = perfectly accurate), how well the summary reflects their own reasoning and emotions when making stock selection decisions. Across users, the summaries receive high average agreement score of 7.8, with low inter-user variance, indicating that the inferred preferences are largely consistent with users decision-making behavior. Conversational Plausibility Validation: We further assess the realism of the simulated advisory dialogues. To avoid over-counting highly correlated interactions within the same user trajectory, we adopt user-level sampling strategy. Specifically, for each of the 10 users, we randomly sample one decision step from the 23-step Conv-FinRe: Conversational and Longitudinal Benchmark for Utility-Grounded Financial Recommendation Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY longitudinal conversation, resulting in 10 representative dialogue instances. Each sampled conversation is independently evaluated by three domain experts with backgrounds in finance and conversational systems. Experts rate each dialogue on 09 Likert scale along four dimensions: role consistency, linguistic naturalness, behavioral plausibility of user responses, and cross-turn coherence. The final plausibility score for each conversation is computed as the average across the four dimensions and across experts. Overall, the simulated dialogues achieve mean plausibility score of 8.1, indicating that the generated conversations closely resemble realistic financial advisory interactions rather than scripted or artificial exchanges."

In contrast, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and Llama3-XuanYuan3-70BChat excel in MRR and HR@K, indicating they are more effective at mimicking the users realized, and often noisy, decision-making patterns. This gap reveals fundamental trade-off: 𝑦𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙 acts as financially robust reference to align with the users latent psychology, whereas 𝑦𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟 captures the empirical behavior which may deviate from pure rationality. The results suggest that models must navigate the tension between providing the most rational advice and maintaining empathetic behavioral alignment."

Llama3.3-70B-Instruct exemplifies this trend by achieving the highest alignment with both Utility and Momentum, yet its sharp decline in Risk alignment proves that it struggles to decouple downside protection from growth-oriented signals. 13https://huggingface.co/Duxiaoman-DI/Llama3-XuanYuan3-70B-Chat Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yan et al.

By maintaining stable and relatively high alignment with Safety while avoiding extreme bias toward return-driven metrics, DeepSeek-V3.2 shows superior ability to integrate conflicting advisory signals into compromise recommendation. The GPT series also exhibits similar balanced characteristics, though with slightly less consistency than DeepSeek in the safety dimension. The behavior of Llama3-XuanYuan3-70B-Chat is particularly noteworthy given its background as domain-specific LLM finetuned on financial corpora. Despite its lower expert alignment scores, it achieves high behavioral hit rates in Table 4, suggesting that its financial expertise manifests as empathetic alignment with User Choices rather than strict adherence to idealized mathematical formulas. XuanYuan3 acts as seasoned human consultant who prioritizes the pragmatic, albeit noisy, preferences of real-world investors over rigid algorithmic consistency."

            "content": "Figure 2: Step-wise improvement in utility-based alignment from conversational history. From financial advisory perspective, these gains suggest that conversation history allows models to gauge baseline investment styles, identifying whether user is inherently risk-averse or returnsensitive. However, the plateauing suggests that the marginal utility of additional historical context diminishes once stable \"investor persona\" is established, at which point ranking performance becomes more contingent on the immediate market context M𝑡 than on further preference refinement. Figure 3 provides finer-grained diagnostic by comparing average utility alignment with and without longitudinal context. Based on the relative shifts from the diagonal, we identify three archetypes. Adaptive Advisors (GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B) show clear improvements when history is available, indicating effective cross-turn preference integration and progressive alignment with the users latent risk profile. Transaction-driven Analysts (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3-70B) remain close to the diagonal, achieving strong utility rankings but exhibiting limited gains from conversational context, suggesting reliance on contemporaneous market signals rather than personalization. Behavioral Overfitters (Qwen2.5-72B, Llama3-XuanYuan3) experience degraded utility alignment when history is introduced, implying over-sensitivity to noisy user actions and tendency to prioritize behavioral mimicry over stable preference inference. The results reveal non-uniform preference discovery and highlight the need to separate surface imitation from genuine decisionutility alignment, as evidenced by XuanYuans performance drop.

Through inverse optimization of latent risk preferences, it supports multiview evaluation that separates rational decision quality from observed user behavior. Our results reveal persistent tension between utility-based ranking and behavioral alignment: generalpurpose LLMs often optimize utility more effectively, while domainspecific models tend to overfit transient user actions. These findings expose the limits of behavior-only evaluation and motivate benchmarks that disentangle long-term investor preferences from short-term market noise.
