Introduction and Background The Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLiC-it)1 is the leading conference in Italy dedicated to Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is organised by the Associazione Italiana di Linguistica Computazionale (AILC)2, and it provides platform for researchers, academics, and industry professionals to present advancements in NLP, linguistic resources, machine learning for language, and linguistic applications driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The conference was first held in 2014, with its first edition in Pisa. Since then, it has been hosted by different Italian universities, including Trento, Napoli, Roma, Torino, Bari, Bologna, Milano, and Venezia. In 2024, for its tenth edition, CLIC-IT returned to Pisa, marking decade of contributions to the Italian and international computational linguistics community.

The conference has steadily grown over the years, both in terms of the number of papers and participants, as shown in Table 1. It has become staple of the Italian research 1 https://www.ai-lc.it/en/conferences/clic-it/ 2 https://www.ai-lc.it/en/ Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends communities for CL and NLP, fostering new contributions and ideas focused on the Italian language. With the rapidly evolving landscape of CL and NLP, driven by both increasing research volume and paradigm-shifting innovations such as Transformerbased Large Language Models (LLMs), new research directions have emerged globally and in Italy. The field has, for example, transitioned from focus on lexical and semantic resources to topics such as large-scale language modelling, multimodal processing and applications such as affect detection and fact-checking. This transformation is visible not only on the international stage but also within the Italian research ecosystem, as reflected in CLiC-it. In this study, we aimed to analyse and evaluate these ten years of CL and NLP in Italy through the lens of CLiC-it. Several works have proposed similar evaluations of this research field, both at the national (Sprugnoli et al. 2019; Passaro et al. 2020) and international level (Anderson, Jurafsky, and McFarland 2012; Mohammad 2019). Here, we attempt to move step forward and provide the data that drove our analysis, in the form of the CLiC-it Corpus. This corpus is curated collection of ten years of conference proceedings. Beyond merely compiling papers, our work provides detailed analysis of both metadata, such as author affiliations, geographic and gender distributions, and content, investigating how research topics have developed over time. The corpus offers lens into how Italian NLP research has evolved. The CLiC-it Corpus and the results of the analysis we carried out on the data, presented in this contribution, are valuable resource for any NLP researcher interested in the Italian computational linguistics landscape, both long-standing and newcomers. It can be in fact particularly useful for those new to the field who wish to gain broad overview of research trends, collaboration networks, and institutional contributions. At the same time, more experienced researchers may find it insightful to explore longstanding questions about authorship, international participation, and the evolution of topics within the Italian NLP community, supported by empirical evidence. Additionally, it is valuable resource to keep track of the evolution of the Italian NLP community over time. Our work contributes to the NLP and CL research communities, both Italian and global, in the following ways: (cid:114) (cid:114) We introduce and release the CLiC-it corpus, created by semi-automatically parsing all accepted papers across all editions of CLiC-it. The corpus is organised to provide core information on each research paper. We provide an in-depth analysis of the corpus, focusing both on metadata, such as distributions of participants, their affiliations and gender, their research age, the Italian networks formed over the years, etc., and on content, providing an analysis of the major topics that have interested the community over the years. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the CLiC-it corpus, detailing its structure and the criteria adopted for its creation. Section 3 presents an in-depth analysis of the corpus metadata, focusing in particular on the authors of the papers presented at the conference editions (Section 3.2), and on institutional collaborations and co-authorship networks (Section 3.3). In Section 4, we investigate the thematic content of CLiC-it papers, first outlining the topic modelling methodology used (Section Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends 4.1), and then discussing the research trends that emerge from the analysis (Section 4.2). Finally, Section 5 summarises the main findings. 2. The CLiC-it Corpus The CLiC-it Corpus is collection of metadata and textual content from the 693 papers presented at the CLiC-it conference over its 10 editions. Its primary goal is to serve as an openly accessible, structured resource for investigating research trends and examining the development of the Italian NLP community over time. By offering comprehensive overview of the communitys scholarly production, the corpus enables longitudinal analyses of authorship, collaboration, and thematic focus. Furthermore, its design ensures long-term value, as it can be easily extended to include papers from future editions of the conference, thus supporting ongoing monitoring of the communitys evolution. To enable such diverse types of analyses, the corpus is designed to include both metadata and text content of the presented papers. This data was primarily acquired from the source files of the papers, kindly provided by the members of the AILC community who organised the various editions of the conference over the years (see Acknowledgements). The source files were shared in editable formats, such as LaTeX or proprietary Word documents, which allowed for the extraction of clean and structured text. However, for some editions (2014, 2018, 2019, and 2023), it was not possible to retrieve the original source files. In these cases, we extracted the paper text directly from the official conference proceedings available in PDF format. To obtain machine-readable text suitable for inclusion in the corpus, we tested different extraction strategies. For instance, we employed NotebookLM3 to convert PDFs into editable text, followed by manual correction and refinement to ensure accuracy and consistency. Once we obtained editable versions of all the conference papers, we proceeded with the extraction of both metadata and textual content. This step required different strategies depending on the format of the original files. For LaTeX documents, we implemented an automated workflow using the Python TexSoup library4, which allowed us to reliably extract key metadata fields, such as author names, paper titles, and affiliations, by targeting the corresponding fields in the standard conference templates. We also parsed the main LaTeX files to automatically extract the text of specific sections, namely the abstract, introduction, and conclusions, while removing all comments and LaTeX formatting tags to produce clean textual data. In contrast, for papers provided as Word files or as plain text obtained from PDF extraction, the metadata and relevant content were extracted manually. Since the CLiC-it conference allows the submission of papers both in English and Italian, we applied further step to ensure linguistic uniformity across the corpus. All papers written in Italian (the total number across all editions is 47) were automatically translated into English using EasyNMT,5 Python library for neural machine translation. Once this process was completed for all editions, we manually reviewed the extracted data to assess the consistency of data formats and apply necessary normalisation procedures. For author names, normalisation involved correcting orthographic variations, applying title case (i.e. capitalising only the first letters) when necessary, and standardising the order of given names and surnames. Institutional affiliations were 3 https://notebooklm.google.com/? 4 https://texsoup.alvinwan.com/ 5 https://github.com/UKPLab/EasyNMT Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends also harmonised: university names were retained at the main institutional level, with references to internal departments or laboratories systematically omitted. In the case of national research centres, the full institute name was preserved. Additionally, Italian institutions were consistently reported in Italian (e.g., Universitá di Firenze instead of University of Florence), while non-Italian institutions were recorded using their international names. Non-academic corporate names remained unaltered. As for the content sections, we focused on including only the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of each paper, as these are standard components across scientific publications and are consistently present in all submissions. This selection ensures comparability across papers and editions while retaining the most informative parts of each contribution. The final dataset includes both the directly extracted content and metadata described above, as well as some additional information derived from them. Specifically, it provides details on the year of publication and the language in which each paper was written, alongside the names and affiliations of the authors. It also contains enriched data on authorship, such as the number of authors per paper, the number of women among them, and whether the first author is female. Institutional details are also reported, including the number of unique affiliations per paper, the presence of nonItalian institutions, and the number and names of authors affiliated with non-Italian and non-academic (corporate) entities. Explicitly reporting this data enables more nuanced understanding of the structure and dynamics of the CLiC-it research community. For instance, it makes the dataset adequate for quantitative analyses of gender representation, international collaboration, and the role of academic versus corporate research within the field. By making these variables readily available, the dataset serves as valuable resource not only for investigating research trends and community evolution but also for supporting meta-scientific studies on scholarly practices in the Italian NLP landscape. The CLiC-it Corpus is freely available6 and can be used for future studies aimed at further exploring these dimensions or integrating them with other national and international research initiatives. 3. Contributors and Collaborations As first step in our analysis of the CLiC-it corpus, we focus on the metadata associated with each paper, particularly the information relative to the paper authors and affiliations. This analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in the composition of the AILC community over the ten editions of the CLiC-it conference, providing insights into both individual participation and institutional collaboration dynamics."

            "content": "This section presents two-part analysis, each tailored to address specific aspects of the metadata and guided by distinct methodological approaches. Section 3.2 presents an in-depth analysis of the authors, with particular attention to the institutional affiliation of contributors. We distinguish between Italian and nonItalian institutions, as well as between academic and non-academic entities. We also track the number of new authors introduced in each conference edition. This part of the analysis relies on descriptive statistics and distributional trends to offer diachronic 6 Link to the github repository: https://github.com/alemiaschi/clic-it_corpus Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends perspective on the development of the CLiC-it author base and the extent of international participation. Section 3.3 shifts the focus to the structure and development of inter-institutional collaboration. To this end, we constructed weighted directed graph of affiliations, = (V, E, ), where each node represents an institution. directed edge = (vi, vj) denotes that authors affiliated with vi have co-authored at least one paper with authors affiliated with vj. The weight wij assigned to each edge was computed following the method proposed by (Liu et al. 2005), which balances both the frequency of collaboration and the relative contribution of each institution in multi-authored papers. To this aim, we computed the weights of edges incorporating the following factors: 1. 2. Institutions that collaborate more frequently should be assigned higher collaboration weight; In papers with many authors from different institutions, the weight of each affiliation pair should be proportionally reduced. This network-based approach allows us to analyse not only the volume but also the intensity and structure of collaborations within the CLiC-it community, offering fine-grained view of how institutional partnerships have emerged and consolidated throughout the years, as described in Section 3.3.1. 3.2 Authorship Trends research community is defined not only by its scientific outputs but also by the people who actively contribute to it. Understanding who contributes to conference, how many, how often, and from where, provides valuable insights into the composition, growth, and inclusivity of that community. Tracking authorship over time captures patterns of continuity and renewal, the impact of outreach and institutional engagement. As way of charting the development of the Italian NLP community, in this section we explore authorship trends across the ten editions of the CLiC-it conference. Over the course of the ten editions, total of 2,006 unique authors contributed to the conference. The inherently interdisciplinary nature of the CL and NLP fields, where research often emerges from collaborations across different areas of expertise, makes multi-authored publications the norm. The CLiC-it corpus reflects this collaborative dynamic, with an average of 3.39 authors per paper across all editions. As shown in Figure 1, the number of different authors per edition shows significant variation, indicating shifts in participation and engagement over time. The inaugural 2014 edition attracted 167 authors, strong starting point that confirmed the presence of solid Italian NLP community and the need to create venue to share and discuss their research. The following years saw generally upward trend, with some fluctuations. steady increase marked the 2019 edition, which registered 252 authors. This increase aligns with broader wave of global interest in NLP, driven by major technological advances (e.g., BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) was released in 2018) and the growing relevance of language technologies across academia and industry. This momentum translated into higher participation in NLP conferences globally and likely influenced the national level as well, including CLiC-it (Mariani et al. 2022). Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, both the 2020 and 2021 editions continued to see substantial participation. The 2024 edition reached record-breaking number of 346 authors, demonstrating the growing appeal and reach of the conference and its topics. Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends Figure 1: Number of different authors in each edition, highlighting those submitting an article to the conference for the first time. Figure 2: Number of different authors in each edition, highlighting those with nonacademic affiliations and with non-Italian affiliation. particularly informative metric in understanding the communitys dynamics is the number of first-time authors per edition. These are, for each edition, individuals who had never contributed to CLiC-it before, and are represented by the red line in Figure 1. This measure offers insight into the openness and renewal of the community. The sustained presence of newcomers alongside returning authors points to the success of CLiC-it in fostering an inclusive research environment and, above all, indicates growing interest of the research community towards the topics of the conference. Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends When we consider the ratio between the number of first-time authors and the number of unique authors for each edition, we observe that around half of the contributors are new in any given year (51.78% on average, excluding the 2014 edition, where all authors are new contributors). This ratio remains high across editions, indicating that the community is growing and continually refreshed by new contributors, such as earlycareer researchers, students, and scholars from adjacent disciplines. Additionally, we focused on two subgroups: non-academic authors and authors with non-Italian affiliations. These categories capture the diversity and internationalisation of the community. Non-academic authors are those affiliated with companies, startups, or institutions outside the traditional academic and research domain (e.g. research and development in corporations) and are represented by the green line in Figure 2. Their presence, although smaller in absolute numbers, remained fairly stable across the years. This suggests strengthening link between research and industry, and rising interest in applied NLP from corporate and public-sector actors. Similarly, the number of authors affiliated with non-Italian institutions (red line in Figure 2) provides useful proxy for assessing the international reach and engagement of the CLiC-it conference. Although CLiC-it primarily targets the Italian computational linguistics community, its appeal has extended beyond national borders, attracting contributions from scholars based in institutions across the globe. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of CLiC-it papers that include at least one author affiliated with non-Italian institution. The map reveals broad international participation, with authors from nearly every continent. Figure 1 in Appendix shows the distribution for each edition. The presence of international contributors, whether co-authors or lead authors, has increased gradually, contributing to the global visibility and relevance of the conference. In later editions, particularly from 2019 onwards, we observe more consistent presence of international researchers. This is in line with the overall growing number of CLiC-it participants discussed above and proves the openness to cross-border collaborations of the Italian community. When we consider the overall distribution in Figure 3, we notice that, as expected, European countries are the most prominently represented, reflecting both geographic proximity and strong academic ties with Italy. Notably, the Netherlands stands out as the most represented non-Italian country, with 38 papers involving Dutchaffiliated authors. This is followed by Germany (27 papers), and Spain and Switzerland, each contributing 22 papers. These results are likely influenced not only by geographic proximity but also by the high number of Italian researchers working in academic institutions within these countries. More noteworthy, however, is the participation of authors affiliated with institutions in Asia and the Americas. While these regions are geographically distant from Italy, their presence in CLiC-it indicates the existence of international research collaborations, as we will discuss further in Section 3.3. Together, these observations highlight the evolving role of CLiC-it as not only national but also an increasingly international venue for scientific exchange in the field of computational linguistics. The increasing number of contributors, the involvement of professionals outside academia, and the participation of international scholars all reflect the growth of the CLiC-it conference as hub for NLP research and innovation. 3.3 Community Collaborations The collaboration network constructed from the CLiC-it corpus, following the methodology outlined in Section 3.1, comprises 280 nodes and 1,350 edges. Each node represents distinct institutional affiliation, while each edge corresponds to collaboration, Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends Figure 3: Countries of non-Italian author affiliations submitting paper at the CLiC-it conference. Darker colour shades reflect the number of papers submitted that include at least one author from that country. defined as the co-authorship of at least one paper by members of the connected institutions. The structure of this graph offers insights into the dynamics of institutional collaboration within the CLiC-it community. To this aim, we performed connected components analysis, graph-based method used to identify and isolate subgraphs in which all nodes are connected to each other by at least one path. Typically, the method allows distinguishing between weakly and strongly connected components depending on whether the direction of edges is respected. The analysis involves traversing the graph using algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to group nodes into their respective components, revealing the underlying structure and partitioning of the graph. Due to the symmetric nature of the edges in our graph (e = (vi, vj) E, there exists corresponding edge = (vj, vi) E), every weakly connected component is also strongly connected. This symmetry ensures that the direction of traversal does not impact the connectivity, making the graph undirected for the purposes of component analysis. Therefore, we use standard depth-first search (DFS)-based or Union-Find algorithm to identify the components and refer to them simply as Connected Components (CCs). This approach allowed us to partition the graph into maximal subgraphs in which all nodes are mutually reachable, providing clear structure for subsequent analysis. The graph contains total of 16 Connected Components (CCs), indicating that the network of affiliations is fragmented into several isolated subgroups. The largest of these is giant component comprising 241 nodes, which is visually represented in Figure 5. This component reflects dense core of institutions and affiliations that are interconnected through co-authorship or collaboration links. In contrast, the remaining Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends Figure 4: Number of different affiliations in each edition, also showcasing the number of affiliations outside of Italy. 15 components are significantly smaller and more peripheral, with the largest among them including only six nodes, and many consisting of just few or even isolated nodes. Despite the presence of this dominant component, the graph as whole is sparsely connected, as reflected by the low overall graph density of approximately 0.017. Graph density, defined as the ratio of observed edges to the total number of possible edges in the network, is relatively low, indicating that collaborations tend to concentrate within specific, recurring clusters of institutions. The average node degree is 9.64, meaning that each affiliation has collaborated, on average, with 9 to 10 others. These figures suggest the presence of stable, long-term collaborations between institutions, likely driven by shared research interests and complementary expertise that have fostered consistent joint work over the years. 3.3.1 Key Players in the Affiliation Network We conducted centrality analysis to identify the institutional hubs and bridges in the collaboration network. Our goal is to gain insight into which institutions play prominent roles in the network, whether through direct connections or proximity to others. To this aim, we applied the following centrality measures to capture different dimensions of influence and connectivity. (cid:114) Degree Centrality (DEG): Degree centrality measures the number of edges directly connected to node. In this setting, it represents the total number of unique collaborations an affiliation has engaged in. This metric reflects an affiliations immediate activity level within the network and serves as the most straightforward indicator of prominence. Affiliations with high degree centrality are those that have collaborated with many others, suggesting broad engagement or central role in multiple projects. Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends Figure 5: Giant Component in the network of collaborations between affiliations at CLiC-it. (cid:114) (cid:114) Closeness Centrality (CLS): Closeness centrality captures how near node is to all other nodes in the network by computing the reciprocal of the sum of the shortest path distances from that node to all others. This measure identifies affiliations that can quickly reach or influence others, either directly or through few intermediaries. High closeness centrality indicates that an affiliation occupies central position in the global structure of the network, making it more accessible and better positioned for the efficient spread of information or collaboration opportunities. Betweenness Centrality (BTW): Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which node lies on the shortest paths between other pairs of nodes. This metric reflects the potential of an affiliation to act as bridge, facilitating interactions between otherwise disconnected parts of the network. Affiliations with high betweenness centrality can play critical role in maintaining network cohesion and enabling indirect collaborations, even if their number of direct ties is relatively modest. Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends Affiliation Universitá di Torino Fondazione Bruno Kessler CNR-ILC Universitá di Pisa Sapienza Universitá di Roma Universitá di Pavia University of Groningen Universitá di Napoli Federico II CNRS Universitá di Napoli LOrientale DEG CLS BTW Avg.

Each of these centrality measures complements the others by revealing different structural roles of affiliations. To obtain global overview of the nodes centrality, we created three rankings (i.e., one ranking for each metric) based on the decreasing centrality scores obtained by the graph nodes. Then, we computed the average ranking position of each node and created global ranking of institutions based on their average ranking score. This approach provides more comprehensive view of centrality, capturing institutions that consistently hold prominent positions across multiple structural dimensions of the network. It also mitigates the potential bias of relying on any single centrality metric, which might emphasise only one aspect of connectivity. The results of the analysis are reported in Table 2 and offer view of institutional influence, from local engagement to global accessibility and intermediation. The University of Torino stands out as the most central institution across all measures, achieving the highest degree and closeness centrality, as well as notably strong betweenness score, as indicated by its average ranking position of 1.33 in the combined ranking. The standard deviation of the affiliation ranks is very low, with maximum value of 4.93. This indicates that the three centrality measures generally produce very similar rankings, suggesting high level of consistency in how institutional importance is captured across different dimensions of network centrality. This indicates that this institution is highly connected within the network. Fondazione Bruno Kessler and CNR-ILC follow closely, combining high connectivity (degree) with strong reachability (closeness), and moderate bridging roles (betweenness). Other Italian universities, such as Pisa, Roma Sapienza, and Pavia, exhibit balanced centrality scores, indicating active but slightly less dominant roles in the network. The presence of international institutions like the University of Groningen and CNRS further demonstrates the networks openness. Although their centrality scores are somewhat lower than those of the Italian core, their inclusion among the top 10 confirms their active involvement and structural relevance within the network. Overall, the table reveals dense central cluster of affiliations that serve as both hubs and bridges, shaping the collaborative dynamics of the research community. Alzetta et al.

Content Analysis Having examined authorship patterns and institutional collaborations within the CLiCit community, we now turn our attention to the scientific content of the conference. Understanding which topics have been most frequently addressed over the years provides complementary perspective on the communitys evolution, highlighting shifts in research priorities and the emergence of new areas of interest. This section outlines the methodology employed to analyse and categorise the conference papers published over the years, as described in Section 4.1. The goal is to identify prevailing research topics and trends. The findings derived from this content analysis are presented and discussed in Section 4.2. Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends 4.1 Methodology For the topic modelling analysis of the papers presented at CLiC-it over the years, we employed the BERTopic framework proposed by (Grootendorst 2022). This framework consists of three primary steps. First, Transformer-based model is utilised to extract text embeddings. Next, these embeddings are processed using the UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction) algorithm (McInnes, Healy, and Melville 2018) to reduce dimensionality and optimise the clustering process, which is subsequently performed using the HDBSCAN (Hierarchical DensityBased Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm (McInnes et al. 2017). HDBSCAN extends the density-based DBSCAN algorithm by adopting soft-clustering approach, allowing for the identification of outliers, i.e., texts that are considered noise or texts that could potentially belong to multiple clusters. Furthermore, HDBSCAN enables the parameterisation of cluster formation by specifying minimum number of texts per cluster. Finally, keywords associated with each topic are identified through cTF-IDF (class-based Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), modified version of the popular TF-IDF measure. Note that in the present scenario, the texts of documents belonging to the same topic are concatenated and treated as single document for the computation of the inverse document frequency. We applied BERTopic 7 to the abstracts, introductions, and conclusions of all papers in the CLiC-it corpus (see Section 2) to generate topic embeddings for our analysis. The dimensionality reduction via UMAP was carried out using the following parameters: n_neighbors = 13, n_components =2 (number of dimensions), min_dist = 0.01, and metric = cosine. As for the HDBSCAN algorithm, we used the Euclidean Distance and minimum number of elements per cluster of 7. Documents identified as outliers (185) by HDBSCAN were reassigned to the most similar existing clusters to ensure full topic coverage. This process initially resulted in 24 clusters, each described by 10 keywords generated with c-TF-IDF. We then manually merged clusters that showed substantial semantic overlap based on their keyword profiles. Finally, we used ChatGPT to generate single descriptive label for each cluster, yielding total of 15 refined clusters. Table 3 reports the list of topics and keywords found using the methodology described above. 4.2 Research Trends in the CLiC-it Community Figure 7 displays the distribution of papers across the 15 thematic clusters identified in the CLiC-it corpus through topic modelling. Overall, the clusters reflect both methodological approaches and domain-specific applications of NLP and computational linguistics. The most represented topic is Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis (189 papers). The keywords extracted from the papers in this cluster indicate an interest towards resource creation (see keywords like annotation, morphological, frame semantics) and analysis (text mining, computational lexicon, possibly referring to computational approaches to lexicography), as well as information representation approaches, suggested by the keyword knowledge graph. In addition to this, several other clusters represent foundational areas of NLP. The Syntax and Dependency Treebanks cluster focuses on dependency parsing and syntactically annotated resources such as 7 https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends Figure 6: Number of CLiC-it papers organised by topic. treebanks. The In-domain IR and IE cluster addresses text retrieval and classification, as well as domain-specific information extraction techniques, particularly in the legal and medical domains. Finally, the Multimodal cluster highlights the integration of textual data with speech and other modalities, as NLP systems evolve to handle richer and more complex input types. high number of papers also fall under the Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate cluster (123 papers). The associated keywords indicate strong focus of these papers on affective computing and ethical concerns, especially in the context of digital discourse. Such result is likely driven by the widespread availability of social media data in past years and the popularity of their analysis within the NLP community. More specialised areas, including Latin Resources, Learner Corpora and Textual Genre and Literature Linguistics, also emerge with notable presence, indicating the diversity of the domains addressed at CLiC-it. These clusters partially overlap in theme with the larger cluster on lexical and semantic resources: while all discuss corpora of textual linguistic resources, the learner corpora and Latin resources papers seem to be more concerned with corpus construction and description rather than corpus analysis. Conversely, papers on literary linguistics discuss approaches for analysing the text style, as suggested by the keyword linguistic features. In between, Text Simplification emerges as topic addressed by small portion of the CLiC-it community, although it addresses Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends both issues related to corpus construction (see keywords like parallel corpus and administrative texts) and to simplification approaches (lexical simplification). Finally, clusters like Fact Checking and Fake News Detection and Gender and Inclusive Language Studies, though smaller in size, point to the communitys engagement with socially relevant research topics. In fact, while the former group is interested in detecting deceptive information from news corpora, the latter addresses issues related to gender biases through different data sources. Topics such as Language Models and Chatbots and Dialogue Systems likely emerged more recently, indicating shift toward neural and conversational technologies, consistent with broader trends in NLP. To explore how research interests have evolved over time, we performed diachronic analysis of the topic distribution across CLiCit editions. The results, displayed in Figure 7, reveal several meaningful patterns and shifts in focus within the community. In what follows, we describe the most salient trends, highlighting the rise and decline of specific themes and relating them to broader developments in NLP research. Interestingly, several topic clusters emerging from the CLiC-it corpus align closely with broader trends identified in large-scale analyses of the ACL Anthology (Mohammad 2019) spanning from the 1960s to 2020, although the two datasets overlap for relatively short period (20142020). For example, the analysis of the ACL corpus reveals the historical centrality of topics such as Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, and Parsing, also reflected in the CLiC-it proceedings. Moreover, both datasets capture growing interest in neural approaches for language modelling tasks. In the ACL corpus, this is evidenced by the rising frequency of terms such as neural, word embeddings, and deep learning. This trend is mirrored in the CLiC-it corpus through the growing prominence of the topic Language Models (see figure 7), where keywords such as large language and language models are likely indicative of the increasing use of largescale and generative neural models. Finally, both corpora reveal diversification of research topics over time. In the ACL Anthology, the dominance of few key terms has diminished in recent decades in favour of broader array of specialised areas. This evolution is echoed in the presence of niche clusters within the more recent CLiC-it corpus, such as Gender and Inclusive Language Studies, and Fact Checking and Fake News Detection. 4.2.1 Diachronic Analysis of Topics The evolution of research topics across CLiC-it conference editions reveals significant trends and shifts in focus within the Italian computational linguistics community. Figure 7 illustrates how these thematic clusters have varied over time, offering insight into both long-standing interests and emerging areas. The earliest editions of CLiC-it (20142018) display relatively stable distribution of topics, with strong emphasis on resource-oriented research. In particular, the cluster on lexical and semantic resources dominates this period, reflecting the communitys foundational efforts in building and analysing linguistic resources. Similarly, other resource-related clusters, including those addressing application scenarios of corpus analysis, feature prominently, indicating the centrality of corpus-driven approaches in the initial stages of the conference. Among the most popular application-oriented topics in the early years was sentiment analysis, largely supported by the availability of social media data and the popularity of sentiment analysis methods. While this topic has been consistently relevant throughout the years, noticeable dip occurred in 2018 and again in 2022. Conversely, Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends Figure 7: Coverage of topics in CLiC-it papers across editions. peak in 2020 may be attributed to increased online activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought renewed attention to the affective and ethical dimensions of digital discourse. Around this same period, papers focusing on literature analysis gradually diminished, giving way to growing interest in fake news detection and gender bias studies. These began with studies on traditional models such as Word2Vec around 2017, and evolved from 2019 onward to include Transformer-based approaches. This change in focus might reflect growing interest within the community in the socio-cultural application of their research. Also emerging in this transitional period (2019-2022) is the cluster on chatbots and dialogue systems. The models proposed by the papers falling into this topic reflect the shift from rule-based systems to dialogue systems based on more recent neural models. In fact, while most of the early proposed solutions were based on templates and graph databases, more recently, several resources have been produced to train conversational agents, enabling the development of more advanced data-driven models. As observed from Figure 7, dialogue systems were quickly supplanted in 2022 by generative AI models based on LLMs. Some areas of research have maintained steady presence throughout the years. Topics such as multimodality, Machine Translation, syntax, and Latin Resources have shown consistent contributions, underlining the communitys commitment to traditional linguistic tasks and classical languages. In contrast, topics like Distributional Semantics, Information Retrieval and Extraction, and corpus construction have experienced marked decline in recent years. This reduction appears to coincide with the Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends rise of research on Language Models, which has seen substantial growth since 2018. The increasing focus on this topic reflects broader shift in NLP towards pre-trained neural architectures and their application in multilingual and domain-specific contexts, with particular emphasis on the Italian language. The trajectory of the Language Models topic offers clear example of the fields methodological evolution. Before 2018, papers largely employed traditional machine learning and deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and support vector machines (SVMs). From 2019 onwards, however, the Transformer architecture became predominant, marking turning point in NLP research. Studies increasingly explored the fine-tuning of large pre-trained models for downstream tasks such as question answering and text classification. Notably, this phase saw the emergence of Italian-specific models such as GePpeTto (De Mattei et al. 2020) and BERTino (Muffo and Bertino 2020), along with growing interest in transfer learning techniques and the evaluation of language models through metrics such as perplexity. Looking forward, some currently declining topics may regain momentum in light of these recent technological developments. For instance, interest in Language Acquisition could be revitalised by the rise of Baby LLMs that target developmental linguistics and incremental learning. Similarly, the topic of text simplification may experience renewed relevance given the ability of generative models to transform and adapt texts for clarity and accessibility. Multimodality represents an example of long-standing areas that are experiencing growing attention. Although present since the first editions, multimodal research has expanded in recent years, reflecting increasing interest in integrating linguistic data with other communicative modalities, especially in the domain of spoken language analysis. Overall, the diachronic analysis reveals dynamic and responsive research community. From foundational linguistic resources to state-of-the-art generative models, the CLiC-it community has demonstrated sustained ability to integrate continuity with innovation. Some areas have matured and stabilised, while others have emerged in response to new technological affordances and societal needs. This trajectory underscores the dual focus of the community: advancing methodological frontiers while addressing the ethical, inclusive, and application-driven dimensions of NLP. 5. Conclusions In this study, we presented the CLiC-it Corpus, structured and curated dataset encompassing ten years of research output from the Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLiC-it). To assemble the corpus, combination of automatic and manual extraction methods was used. In the end, we compiled metadata and textual content from total of 693 scientific papers, offering detailed snapshot of the Italian CL and NLP community from 2014 to 2024. Our analysis explored key dimensions of the communitys evolution, including authorship patterns, gender and institutional diversity, collaboration networks, and shifting research priorities. The results of our investigation highlight growing research landscape. We observed an increasing number of submissions and participants, gradual internationalisation of contributions, and diversification of research topics in line with global trends, such as the emergence of multimodality, Large Language Models, and socially impactful applications like misinformation detection and sentiment analysis. The analysis of coauthorship and institutional networks further illustrates the collaborative nature of Alzetta et al. CLiC-it Corpus and Community Trends the Italian NLP landscape and its openness to cross-institutional and interdisciplinary research. By releasing the CLiC-it Corpus, we provide valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, both Italian and foreign, interested in understanding the dynamics of NLP research in Italy. The corpus supports additional empirical studies on authorship, topic evolution, and collaboration, and can serve as reference for future evaluations of the fields trajectory. Our end goal was to facilitate more informed, inclusive, and strategically guided research efforts, both within Italy and in dialogue with the broader international NLP community. The corpus is designed to be extensible and sustainable, and we expect to maintain it by including new research papers for upcoming editions of CLiC-it. Future updates will also enable longitudinal monitoring of the communitys development. We encourage further use and enrichment of the resource, and we hope it will inspire similar initiatives in other linguistic and national contexts.
