            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing knowledge from their pretraining data, making them effective across wide range of applications (Petroni et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020). However, not all knowledge acquired during pretraining is necessary or appropriate in all deployment contexts. For example, chatbot designed for children should not discuss guns, and generation of harmful, irrelevant or legally protected information generally hinders model utility and introduces safety and legal risks 1 Figure 1: PISCES disentangles model parameters to identify those encoding target concept (e.g. Harry Potter). It then edits those disentangled parameters to precisely remove the target concept, before reconstructing them and finally replacing them in the model. (Zou et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025; Gong et al., 2025). Our work tackles fundamental question: how can we identify and remove certain knowledge while preserving model utility? Specifically, we study an instance of this problem, where the goal is to erase knowledge about certain concept (e.g., Harry Potter or Guns), such that the model can no longer generate information about it. Prior work has explored different approaches for erasing information in LLMs, including fine-tuning models through an unlearning framework to eliminate conceptual knowledge (Li et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024; Yamashita et al., 2024; Gandikota et al., 2025), editing certain facts through specific parameter updates (Meng et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2025), and intervening on model representations to erase certain attributes (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Ravfogel et al., 2020; Iskander et al., 2023; Belrose et al., 2023). Among these methods, those framed as unlearning are the most aligned with our setting (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Yamashita et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a), as they aim to remove knowledge rather than attributes or biases from the model. However, these methods remain insufficient for robust conceptual knowledge erasure. First, they are overly coarseimpacting not only the targeted concept but also semantically related ones and even general model capabilities (Lynch et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Barez et al., 2025). Moreover, erasure is often shallow: the supposedly removed knowledge can be recovered through adversarial prompting or fine-tuning (Lo et al., 2024; Thaker et al., 2024; Deeb and Roger, 2025; Doshi and Stickland, 2025). To overcome these shortcomings, we propose PISCES (Precise In-parameter Suppression for Concept EraSure), fine-grained concept erasure method, which first localizes directions in the parameter space of the model that capture conceptrelated knowledge, and then precisely edits these parameters. Concretely, given transformer-based language model and concept c, disentangler model is utilized to separate MLP parameters into fine-grained features. Next, features that are specific to the target concept are identified using an output-centric automated interpretability method vocabulary projection (Nostalgebraist, 2020; Geva et al., 2021; Gur-Arieh et al., 2025). Lastly, the identified concept-related features are ablated from the MLP parameters that encode them. Figure 1 illustrates this process. We focus on the MLP layers as prior work has shown they act as key-value memories that capture knowledge (Geva et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2022; Geva et al., 2022, 2023), and implement our disentangler with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which have shown promise in disentangling model activations (Huben et al., 2024). We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate PISCES against existing methods, measuring erasure efficacy, specificity, coherence, and robustness to relearning (Liu et al., 2024; Lynch et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025a). Our results show that PISCES slightly outperforms existing methods in efficacy, while substantially improving specificity and robustness. Specifically, PISCES achieves 5%31% higher specificity and 28%38% greater robustness, demonstrating superior precision and robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Figure 2 presents example responses to queries about erased concepts across different methods. Lastly, we find that PISCESs success hinges on identifying coherent concept-related features, highlighting that stronger disentangler models could further improve erasure performance. Our work makes the following contributions: (a) we introduce PISCES novel framework for precisely erasing concepts in model parameters, (b) we demonstrate an implementation of our framework using SAEs, (c) we show that PISCES outperforms prior state-of-the-art methFigure 2: Sampled questions about erased concepts with responses generated by models post unlearning by PISCES, ELM and RMU, as well as the baseline response.

            "content": "Concept erasure Prior work has studied erasure of linearly decodable attributes from model representations, typically to mitigate bias via some form of linear projection. Early work targeted gender bias in token embeddings (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Ravfogel et al., 2020), later extending to hidden activations (Belrose et al., 2023; Iskander et al., 2023). Our work is different in its motivation, aiming to remove conceptual knowledge rather than certain attributes or biases. Moreover, we target erasure from model parameters rather than from its representations. Knowledge editing Knowledge editing methods aim to precisely edit specific facts in the models parameters without full retraining (Mitchell et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023; Meng et al., 2023; Hsueh et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b). These methods typically formulate facts as triplets composed of subject, an object and their relation. While effective for editing collections of facts, applying them in our setting could prove difficult: removing concept like Uranium for example, would require enumerating and editing every relation that it appears in that the model has knowledge ofan approach that we found in our results to be less effective. 2 Concept unlearning Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training examples after deployment (Cao and Yang, 2015), originally for privacy (Ginart et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2023), and more recently for copyright and safety (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Li et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024). To work at higher level of abstraction, recent methods have turned their focus to unlearning entire concepts as opposed to specific training examples (Yamashita et al., 2024; Gandikota et al., 2025). Most unlearning methods fine-tune on forget-set while preserving performance on retain-set, but fine-tuning affects all model parameters, many unrelated to the target concept, potentially resulting in low specificity (Lynch et al., 2024; Barez et al., 2025). Also, without targeting the parameters that specifically encode the knowledge, these methods often leave it intact, leading to shallow unlearning and poor robustness (Hong et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025; Deeb and Roger, 2025). In contrast, we edit only the directions encoding the concept itself, enabling more robust and generalizable removal (Yamashita et al., 2024). Perhaps closest to our work are recent methods that use SAEs for concept unlearning (Farrell et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025; Frikha et al., 2025; Muhamed et al., 2025). These methods disentangle model activations into interpretable features, which they then steer to affect the models ability to generate text about given concept. However, this approach has key limitations: steering with SAEs has been shown to degrade coherence (Wu et al., 2025b), incurs high computational overhead due to large hidden dimensions (Lieberum et al., 2024; He et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2025), and makes non-persistent edits that fail under white-box threat models (Grosse et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025; Łucki et al., 2025). In contrast, we disentangle and edit parameters directly, producing persistent changes that activate only when the concept is invoked. In-Parameter Concept Erasure Problem setup We address the problem of erasing conceptual knowledge from LLMs. As it is nontrivial to precisely define what concept is, we follow Sajjad et al. (2021); Kheir et al. (2024) and view concept as human-understandable group of features, examples, or words that share common property and can be localized within models internal representations. Example concepts can be Harry Potter, Sunday or Guns. This view aligns with the desiderata of meaningfulness and coherency by Ghorbani et al. (2019), and is consistent with previous analyses of concepts in language models (Sajjad et al., 2022; Dalvi et al., 2022). Let be target concept and model. Specifically, we assume that is transformer-based auto-regressive language model. Our goal is to erase knowledge about from , such that cannot generate correct information about c, while other knowledge and capabilities of are retained. Erasure approach We wish to tackle the aforementioned problem by erasing directly from the models parameters, rather than from its representations. To this end, we focus on erasing from the MLP parameters, which have been shown to act as memories and play key role in knowledge recall mechanisms of LLMs (Geva et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2022; Geva et al., 2022, 2023). An MLP layer comprises an input projection matrix Win Rdmlpd, an output projection matrix Wout Rdmlpd, and an element-wise nonlinear activation function σ.1 For hidden representation Rd, the layers output is defined as: MLP(x) = out σ(Winx) := dmlp (cid:88) i=1 aivi (1) where vi Rd is the i-th row of Wout and ai is its corresponding neural activation.2 We refer to each vi as an MLP vector. Given the above definition (Eq. 1), natural approach would be to target specific MLP vectors that activate for the concept. Indeed, prior work has shown that individual MLP vectors often encode and promote human-interpretable concepts (Geva et al., 2022). However, while MLP vectors have shown promise for editing model knowledge (Dai et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024), recent work has demonstrated that concept representations are not always basis aligned, manifesting in polysemantic MLP vectors (Bricken et al., 2023; Huben et al., 2024). Due to polysemanticity, concepts may be distributed across multiple MLP vectors or entangled within single vector (Elhage et al., 2022; Bricken et al., 2023; Gurnee et al., 2023). This undermines efforts to precisely remove 1We omit bias terms as modern LLMs often do not have them and since our method does not intervene on them. 2In modern LLMs, activations often go through additional gating before the output projection (Liu et al., 2021). specific knowledge without damaging unrelated capabilities, limiting both efficacy and specificity. To overcome this, we propose to disentangle neurons into fine-grained, interpretable features, allowing us to precisely remove directions associated with the target concept across all neurons, without affecting unrelated knowledge."

            "content": "We introduce PISCES (Precise In-parameter Suppression for Concept EraSure) method for precisely locating and erasing conceptual knowledge in parameter space. In 4.1, we present the general framework of our method, and in 4.2 describe how we implemented it. See Figure 3 for an illustration of our method. 4.1 Framework We assume an invertible disentangler model : Rd Rk that transforms hidden representations in dimension into higher-dimensional space of features, where d. feature corresponds to one-hot vector that can be vectorized via D1(f ) = wf Rd. Let := D(x) be the feature activation for vector Rd, then we can represent using the feature vectors: D1(m) = (cid:88) = mf wf (2) Examples for such disentangler models are SAEs (Lee et al., 2007; Le et al., 2011; Bricken et al., 2023; Huben et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2025) and DAS-based models (Geiger et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024). Here we apply to the MLP parameter vectors, which enables editing them in higher resolution. This is done through the following high-level process. First, we identify the set Fc of features encoding the concept c. Then, we use to disentangle every MLP vector and measure how strongly it is represented by the features in Fc. high activation for any these features signals that encodes the target concept. Based on these scores, we derive set Vc of MLP vectors for editing.3 Next, we edit every vector Vc by modifying its disentangled representation m, specifically ablating all the features in Fc. Lastly, we obtain new representation = D1( m) for that is clean from the 3Intuitively, we would want to edit all vectors, but we find that practically this can hurt specificity and coherence, as explained in 4.2. PISCESs erasure process for Figure 3: Illustration of example concept Harry Potter. First we identify all features that represent the target concept, here colored red. We then disentangle all MLP vectors and collect those that activate the identified features. Finally, we edit the disentangled representation and reconstruct the MLP vector such that it no longer encodes the concept. concept c. The MLP vectors Vc are then replaced in-place with their edited counterparts, cementing the removal of from all MLP parameters. 4.2 Implementation Choice of disentangler We implement the disentangler as sparse autoencoder DSAE, since it has shown promise in some settings for disentangling and affecting model activations (Bricken et al., 2023; Huben et al., 2024; Kissane et al., 2024; Farrell et al., 2024; Marks et al., 2025; Muhamed et al., 2025). Let Wenc Rdk and Wdec Rkd be the encoder and decoder matrices of an SAE, respectively. We define DSAE as the application of Wenc, SAE as the application of Wdec. To disentanand D1 gle MLP vectors, we use SAEs that were trained on MLP outputs (Lieberum et al., 2024; He et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2025) and apply them directly to the MLP vectors. This is justified by Equation (1), which highlights that MLP outputs are linear combinations of the MLP vectors. Therefore, applying an SAE trained on MLP outputs to the corresponding MLP vectors preserves alignment with the original training subspace. Finding concept-related features To identify the set of features Fc that encode target concept, we follow Gur-Arieh et al. (2025) and apply vocabulary projection (VocabProj) to all SAE feature vectors. Namely, we take the feature vector wf and apply the unembedding matrix to it to obtain vector of logits uf := Ewf RC, where RCd is the unembedding matrix and is the models vocabulary. Then, we select features for which the topor bottom-scoring tokens in uf contain high density of concept-related tokens and minimal presence of unrelated ones, applying this process automatically across all layers. The selected features are then filtered by manual inspection. We choose this output-centric approach because it has been shown to better predict the causal influence of features on model outputs (Gur-Arieh et al., 2025). Additional details are provided in A. Selecting MLP vectors for editing To construct Vc, we disentangle all MLP vectors with DSAE and select only those that strongly activate one or more features in Fc. We avoid editing all vectors because each reconstruction introduces small errors (Gurnee, 2024), and when applied at scale, these can accumulate and unintentionally alter model behavior particularly harming specificity and coherence. To do so, for each MLP vector vi, we collect its activation mi for each feature Fc. Then, we compute the maximum activation of across all MLP vectors vi: ˆmf = max mi (3) Lastly, we construct Vc by selecting only MLP vectors that sufficiently activate any target feature according to the following criterion: (cid:8)vi mi τ ˆmf (cid:9) (4) (cid:91) Fc where τ [0, 1] is hyperparameter controlling the selection threshold. In words, we collect all MLP vectors vi that sufficiently activated some feature , with respect to that features maximum activation value. Therefore, τ allows us to control how wide we want our edits coverage to be. Erasing the concept After finding the relevant features Fc and selecting the target MLP vectors Vc, we edit the vectors to remove the concept c. For each vi Vc, we first identify the subset of features to ablate: = (cid:8)f Fc mi τ ˆmf (cid:9) (5) We then ablate features by setting their activations to negative values, which has been shown to effectively suppress their influence when applied to residual stream representations in the context of steering (Farrell et al., 2024; Muhamed et al., 2025). Concretely, let mi = DSAE(vi) be the feature activations for vi. We define mi to match mi, except for the entries = µ ˆmf , such that µ 0 controls the strength of our edit. c, where we set mi The edited MLP vector is then reconstructed via vi = D1( mi) and replaces the original parameters vi in place. For additional implementation details, see A.2."

            "content": "We evaluate PISCES against three other methods suitable for concept erasure. To do so, we take concepts previously evaluated for erasure (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Hong et al., 2025) and erase them from the target models, evaluating efficacy, specificity, coherence and robustness. 5.1 Experimental Setting We conduct four key evaluations for concept erasure (Liu et al., 2024; Lynch et al., 2024; Barez et al., 2025; Deeb and Roger, 2025): Efficacy Does the erasure prevent the model from correctly answering questions about c? We evaluate methods efficacy by measuring its performance on 50 open-style questions, in order to assess the models ability to recall and generate correct information about the target concept. To do so, we first generate QA pairs using GPT-o3 (OpenAI, 2025). Then, after applying each method we prompt the model with each question individually, allowing it to generate for up to 200 tokens. Finally, for each answer the model generated, we use gemini-2.0-flash (Google, 2025) as an LLMas-a-Judge (justified in C), which evaluates how well the given answer matches the correct answer. We then calculate the normalized accuracy as the models accuracy on these questions divided by its baseline accuracy, and take its complement as efficacy. For more information regarding how questions were generated and validated, see D. Specificity Does the erasure preserve unrelated and similar-domain knowledge? Following previous work, to evaluate methods specificity we assess its impact on models general knowledge by evaluating it on the MMLU dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Li et al., 2024a; Lynch et al., 2024; Gandikota et al., 2025).

All results are normalized by the models baseline performance, such that 100% is exactly the models original performance. Results are averaged across all questions, and are presented alongside their 95% confidence intervals.

The x-axis displays the post-erasure accuracy normalized by the baseline accuracy, and the y-axis displays the harmonic mean between all normalized specificity and coherence metrics. The star represents the goal zero accuracy and 100% specificity and coherence. performance on domains similar to the target concept (e.g. for the concept Harry Potter, wed ask questions about Lord of the Rings and Marvel). To do so we follow the steps previously laid out for generating and evaluating open-style questions (see D.1 for more details). Coherence Does the model retain its ability to follow instructions and produce coherent text? We follow the coherence evaluation laid out by Wu et al. (2025b). We collect random subset of 50 tasks (e.g., Give three steps for staying healthy) from the Alpaca-Eval dataset (Li et al., 2023). Each task is given to the edited model, which attempts to execute it for up to 200 tokens. An LLM-as-a-Judge then scores the output on how well it followed the instructions and how coherent it was. Is the erasure resilient to relearning Robustness attacks? We follow the Retraining on evaluation from Deeb and Roger (2025), which checks whether fine-tuning an edited model on conceptrelated text that does not contain answers to evaluation questions, improves performance on them. This is meant to assess whether the target knowledge has truly been unlearned, or merely suppressed in shallow way. To implement this, we take each concepts forget-set data, and filter out any text containing answers to questions we use for evaluating efficacy (details in D.2). We then finetune the edited model on the data, and reevaluate its efficacy score. We do not include adversarial attacks in our robustness evaluation, as their effect was negligible in preliminary tests (see F). Concepts and models To perform our evaluations, we collect five concepts from the ConceptVectors benchmark (Hong et al., 2025), as well as five new sensitive concepts which did not originally appear in the dataset. We also evaluate against the concept of Harry Potter due to its prevalence in unlearning evaluations (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023). Finally, we evaluate all methods against Gemma-2-2B-it (Riviere et al., 2024) and Llama3.1-8B-it (Dubey et al., 2024) since they have SAEs that have been trained on every MLP layer output (Lieberum et al., 2024; He et al., 2024). Methods We compare our method to RMU (Li et al., 2024a), ELM (Gandikota et al., 2025), MEMIT (Meng et al., 2023) and AlphaEdit (Fang four state-of-the-art unlearning et al., 2025), and editing approaches with distinct mechanisms. RMU fine-tunes the model with an emphasis on hidden representations, ELM learns LoRA-based update based on the models output distribution, and MEMIT and AlphaEdit perform direct parameter edits. For each method, concept and model, we perform hyperparameter sweep of 100 configurations using validation set disjoint from the test set,4 selecting the best-performing setup for evaluation (more details in B). As in ConceptVectors, we use the Wikipedia entry of each concept as its forget-set data for methods that require it. 5.2 Results Table 1 shows the results, averaged across all concepts. Figure 4 shows the efficacy-specificity tradeoff across hyperparameters on several concepts, with MEMIT and AlphaEdit omitted due to poor performance (for all concepts and methods, see Figures 6 and 7 in the appendix). PISCES achieves better efficacy-specificity balance Table 1 shows that across both models, PISCES consistently outperforms other methods in efficacy while preserving higher specificity. In PISCES retains 14.3% of original acGemma, curacy while maintaining strong similar-domain performance (84.1%) and near-perfect MMLU and AlpacaEval scores. Results on Llama are even stronger, with just 7.7% retained accuracy and improved specificity and coherence. In contrast, other methods show poorer tradeoffs: for example, the next-best method in Gemma is only 0.7% lower in efficacy but suffers 30% drop in similar-domain accuracy and an 8% drop in MMLU. Figure 4 reinforces these results, showing that PISCES outperforms the baselines by simultaneously attaining lower accuracy, and higher specificity and coherence scores. These results highlight that precise, parameter-based approach to concept erasure enables finer-grained editing of model knowledge, yielding an improved efficacy-specificity tradeoff. 4This results in total of 800 experiments per concept for all methods and models. PISCES improves robustness to relearning Robustness evaluations in Table 1 reveal substanPISCES and other methods. In tial gap between Gemma, PISCES reaches relearning accuracy of 51.5%, while the next-best method on efficacy reaches 85.4%nearly 34% higherindicating that most of the erased knowledge was recovered by fine-tuning on concept-related data, despite excluding evaluation answers. For Llama, PISCES performs slightly worse than in Gemma, reaching relearning accuracy of 65.4%. However, other methods recover most or all of the removed knowledge, reaching 93.2%-103.1% accuracy post fine-tuning. This underscores that prior methods achieve only superficial concept erasure: the underlying knowledge remains in the model and can easily resurface. While PISCES also regains some knowledge under fine-tuningleaving room for improvementthe up-to-38% gap in relearning accuracy shows that directly editing the parameters encoding the target concept yields substantially more robust erasure than general fine-tuning."

Alignment: binary score indicating whether aligns with or not, i.e., 1 if and are the Method 1 concept 10 concepts Gemma 51014 MEMIT AlphaEdit 5.91014 2.61015 ELM 2.81015 RMU 51014 PISCES Llama 1.91015 2.41015 1.11016 1.11016 1.11015 Gemma 4.81015 5.81015 2.61016 2.81016 5 Llama 5.81016 2.31016 1.11017 1.11017 1.11015 Table 2: Estimated FLOPs for applying each method to 1 and 10 concepts. 6N for forward and backward pass per token (Kaplan et al., 2020), multiplied by the amount of tokens in the forget and retain sets. Lastly, for MEMIT and AlphaEdit we approximate the cost by calculating the number of forward and backward passes needed for every fact in the forget set, and for calculating the covariance matrix and residual vector optimization. Results are in Table 2, showing that PISCES performs best at 5 1014 FLOPs for Gemma, and 1.1 1015 FLOPs for Llama, followed by MEMIT and AlphaEdit with similar performance, and then ELM and RMU which are one order of magnitude more expensive. Moreover, since running VocabProj can be performed once and reused across concepts, the cost of adding more concepts for PISCES is comparatively insignificant. Therefore, when applying our method to multiple concepts, PISCES becomes 1-2 orders of magnitude more efficient than all other methods. Notably, this analysis does not take into account the cost of training SAEs and assumes they are provided. Training disentangler SAE is preprocessing step PISCES, which can be done once rather than for per concept. Yet, it entails significant increase in the overall cost. To avoid this, one may consider alternative, more efficient disentanglers (see discussion in the Limitations section)."

            "content": "PISCES, framework for precisely We present erasing conceptual knowledge from language models by disentangling and directly editing their parameters. Unlike prior approaches that rely on finetuning or fact-level editing, PISCES uses disentangler model to isolate directions in the parameter space of the model that represent the concept and removes them with targeted edits. Experiments with two models and diverse concepts show that PISCES achieves higher robustness and specificity than existing methods, while maintaining or Figure 5: Analysis showing the relationships between feature alignment and erasure accuracy (left, 0.72 correlation with p-value 0.01), and between the number of selected features and MMLU performance (right, 0.64 correlation with p-value 0.03). same concepts and 0 otherwise. For example, feature identified as relevant for the concept of baseball, but seems to represent the broader concept of sports will receive score of 0. 2. Coherence: discrete score from 0 to 2 which measures how clearly and distinctively is expressed among the top/bottom tokens in the projection, according to the presence of unrelated tokens. score of 0 means low coherence, where no clear concept is observed. score of 1 indicates moderate coherence, where seems to encode but may also encode other concepts. score of 2 indicates high coherence, where the tokens clearly reflect single, well-defined concept aligned with c. Figure 5 presents the prominent patterns observed. Per-concept results and annotation examples can be found in E. We find that features that strongly correspond to the target concept and express it clearly (i.e. high alignment and coherence) tend to yield better performance on our evaluation metrics. Moreover, concepts with many selected features often exhibit lower MMLU and Alpaca scores, likely due to accumulated reconstruction error (Gurnee, 2024). These results underscore PISCES relies on Ds ability to identify prethat cise, coherent features. When such features are present (e.g., golf, Republic of Ireland, basePISCES performs best; when they are abball), sent (e.g., Uranium), performance declines. 6.2 Computational Efficiency In this section, we compare the computational cost PISCES versus other methods. We of applying PISCES using DSAE by sumcalculate the cost of ming the FLOPs to first perform vocabulary projection for every SAE feature vector, and then to apply the editing process for every isolated MLP vector. For RMU and ELM we rely on the heuristic FLOPs slightly improving efficacy. These results establish in-parameter erasure as state-of-the-art approach for fine-grained and robust conceptual knowledge removal in LLMs."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Although PISCES performs well in our evaluations, there remains significant room for improvement. First, our current implementation only targets the MLP parameters. While prior work has shown that MLPs encode knowledge in the model (Geva et al., 2021, 2022; Dai et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2022; Geva et al., 2023), recent findings suggest that attention heads also contribute to knowledge storage (Elhelo and Geva, 2024). Extending PISCES to include these components could enable more comprehensive erasure. Second, our reliance on SAEs for the disentangler introduces limitations. We can only erase concepts that were captured as features, and must contend with imperfect reconstructions. Future work establishing new methods for disentangling model parameters could address these limitations, and thanks to the generality of PISCES, be easily integrated into our framework. Another possible direction could be to explore supervised disentanglement approaches (Geiger et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024) as potential alternatives to the current unsupervised setupa possibility we leave for future investigation. Lastly, we identify concept-related features based on VocabProj. While this method has proven effective for identifying causal effects on model outputs, it is less reliable in early layers. Thus, incorporating complementary automated interpretability techniques for identifying conceptrelated features could potentially improve the overall performance."

While the goal is to enable removal of undesirable or sensitive concepts, such as fictional content or protected information, this capability could in principle be misused for censorship or the suppression of legitimate knowledge. We acknowledge this risk, but believe the potential benefits of our method outweigh it: enabling safer deployment of LLMs by removing inappropriate or restricted content, supporting compliance with copyright obligations, and enabling better understanding of how concepts are encoded in model parameters. We hope that the insights and tools provided in this work are used to support responsible and transparent AI development."

This section outlines the process we followed, using the Culture of Greece concept and Gemma-2-2B-IT model as running example (Riviere et al., 2024) . Token Selection. We begin by constructing concept-specific token set: 1. We tokenize the forget set associated with the target concept, removing stop words to reduce noise. 2. We apply TF-IDF model (Ramos et al., 2003) to identify the most informative tokens in the filtered text. Figure 6: Performance of PISCES, ELM and RMU on all concepts and two models (Gemma-2-2b-it and Llama-3.18b-it). Each point is single hyperparameter selection taken out of 100 possible choices, presenting only the best performing ones. The x-axis displays the post-erasure accuracy normalized by the baseline accuracy, and the y-axis displays the harmonic mean between all normalized specificity and coherence metrics. The star represents the goal zero accuracy and 100% specificity and coherence. 3. We manually select 25 tokens that appear highly correlated with the concept, preferably from among the top TF-IDF tokens. Example: For the Culture of Greece concept, we selected Greek, Greece, and Athens. TF-IDF ranked Greek and Greece as the top two tokens, with Athens ranked 11th. 4. We automatically expand the manually selected set by: Including tokens that match the selected ones, ignoring case. Adding tokens that are similar in the models embedding space (measured by cosine similarity). Example: Expanding the selected tokens greece, led to the following set: Athens, Athens, GREEK, Greece, greek, Greek, Greeks, Greece, Athenian, Griechenland, Greek, griech). ( greek, Feature Selection. Using the final token set, we then identify and filter relevant SAE features: 1. For each SAE feature, we apply VocabProj to obtain the tokens most associated with it. 14 2. We compute the intersection between the associated tokens and the token set. Features with an intersection size greater than threshold α (we used α = 4) are selected. 3. From this candidate set, we manually filter features that appear strongly aligned with the target concept and weakly associated with unrelated concepts. This manual step typically takes under minute. Example: We retained feature [ Greek, Greek, GREEK, greek, Greeks, Greece, griech, grecque]. We rejected feature [ austria, Spaniards, Tajikistan, Italians, Americans, Egyptians, Greece, Americans] due to its overlap with unrelated concepts. 4. Finally, we prune features by measuring their individual impact on model behavior under our editing procedure. Any feature whose ablation leads to significant performance degradation, as measured on the MMLU validation set, is discarded. A.2 Setting SAE Feature Activations When editing MLP vectors using SAEs by disentangling them and affecting specific features activations, we must take care to affect them correctly such that we dont cause the opposite effect to the one we were pursuing. This is because an MLP vector that seems to promote concept c, might actually be used by the model to suppress it, through negative activations. Therefore, using the notations from 4.1 where vi is an MLP vector were editing, ai is its activation, and is targeted feature, we must identify two factors: (1) Does promote or suppress c, and (2) is ai positive or negative in the concepts context. We determine (1) by whether concept-related tokens appear in the top of the feature vectors vocabulary projection, or the bottom (Voita et al., 2024). We can then ascertain (2) by feeding the concepts forgetset data through the model and taking the majority sign of ai. We then set sf to 1 (1) if promotes (suppresses) c, and sai to be ais majority sign as described above. Finally, when editing vi we set mi = (sf sai) µ ˆmf ."

            "content": "To attain the best possible performance per concept, we conduct hyperparameter grid search for each method per concept. We define 100 hyperparameter configurations based on prior work and manual tuning informed by the original papers. Each method is evaluated on validation set disjoint from the test set, and we select the configuration that achieves the highest harmonic mean of efficacy, specificity, and coherence. the For selected PISCES we range µ {4, 7, 10, 13, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 50} and τ {0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95}, allowing for broad range of activation strengths and widths. For ELM, we selected η {1000, 2000, 5000}, α {8, 16, 32} and 11 numbers of epochs evenly distributed between 40 and 440 including the latter as it made significant difference we saw that in the methods efficacy-specificity tradeoff. For RMU we selected steering coefficient {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30} and {3, 5, 8, 12, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 600}. α For MEMIT in Llama we focus the edit on layers 4,5,6,7,8, with learning rates, optimization steps, and clamp norm factors in the ranges [1 101, 2 101, 3 101, 4 101, 5 101], [10, 15, 20, 25, 30] [1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20] and respectively. In Gemma we focus on the edit layer 3,4,5,6,7, with learning rates and optimization steps and clamp norm factors in the ranges [1 101, 3 101, 5 101], [5, 10, 20] and {0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15} respecin Llama we tively. focus on the same layers with clamp norm factors, learning rates, and optimization steps of {2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 40}, {0.1, 0.3, 0.5} and {20, 25, 30, 35} respectively. For Gemma we had {0.75, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16}, {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5} and {5, 10, 15, 20, 25} respectively. To perform MEMIT and AlphaEdit we follow the steps in (Hong et al., 2025). for AlphaEdit Finally, Justifying use of LLM-as-a-Judge To justify our use of an LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating model-generated answers, we apply the alternative annotator test proposed by Calderon et al. (2025), which assesses whether the LLM performs as well as or better than randomly selected human annotator. Following their procedure, we recruited three human annotators (graduate students) and used set of 120 questions sampled uniformly across concepts, methods, models, and accuracybased evaluations. For each question, annotators received the same inputs as the LLM judge: the question, the correct answer, and the models generated answer. They were asked to evaluate whether the models answer matched the correct one (instructions can be seen in Figure 9). Following Calderon et al. (2025), we set ϵ = 0.1 to reflect the low-expertise nature of the task. The analysis yielded winning rate of ω = 0.67 with p-value of 0.027, indicating that the LLMs judgments can be confidently relied on, thereby justifying its use in our evaluation protocol."

The following are the prompts used for generating the questions. Question Generation Prompt Im going to give you each time concept and its Wikipedia entry. Your job is, based on this Wikipedia knowledge and your general knowledge about the concept, to: - Generate exactly 100 questions and answer in JSON format (question under key and answer under a). - The questions should be easy and simple. - They should be answerable from knowledge changing the of information. - They must not repeat themselves. - Each should have **one** specific correct answer (avoid Name one Xstyle prompts). - Questions must concern the concept only, not tangential topics. - specific correct answer. conceptno question exactly current Ensure every has one or Concept: {concept} Wikipedia entry: {wikipedia_text} Similar Domain Prompt Each time Im going to give you concept. Please then generate 100 questions and answers in JSON format, with questions under and answers under a, that are questions about similar but different domain. For example, if the concept is Harry Potter, it could be questions about Lord of the Rings or Marvel. If its Soccer, it could be questions about Basketball and Baseball, etc. The questions should cover several different concepts from domains related to the given concept. The similarity doesnt have to be exactjust in the same general domain. Keep in mind: - The questions should be simple and easy. - Each question must have exactly one correct 16 answer. - The questions must not repeat themselves. Concept: {concept} We then randomly sampled 5% of all generated QAs and manually validated their accuracy, finding them all to be accurate. D.2 Generating Relearning Data The following section details our generation of relearning data for the Retraining-on-T evaluation protocol introduced by Deeb and Roger (2025). For each concept, we construct dataset containing text related to the concept but excluding any direct answers to the evaluation questions. This setup ensures that if retraining on this data improves performance, that evaluated knowledge was not truly erased, only superficially suppressed. Data Collection. We started by collecting raw concept-related data from the following sources: 1. The concepts Wikipedia article. 2. Related concepts Wikipedia articles. 3. Synthetic concept-related data generated using OpenAIs GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) using the following general prompt: Relearning Data Generation Prompt Generate very long wikipedia-like text about {concept}, explaining its history, etc. Make it as long as possible. Dont use formatting like bullet points and stuff like that - it should just be lots of text. Data Filtering. We split all of the collected data into paragraphs and each paragraph into sentences. Then, we filtered out sentences that might contain answers to the test QAs by taking the following steps: 1. Semantic similarity filtering - Computed the cosine similarity between sentence embeddings using BERT SentenceTransformer (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) and the answers from the test QAs. Sentences with similarity score β (we found β = 0.34 to be optimal) with any of the answers were filtered out. 2. SQuAD filtering Used the deepset/robertabase-squad2 model, based on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and fine-tuned on SQuAD 2. Figure 7: Performance of PISCES, MEMIT and AlphaEdit on all concepts and two models (Gemma-2-2b-it and Llama-3.1-8b-it). Each point is single hyperparameter selection taken out of 100 possible choices, presenting only the best performing ones. The x-axis displays the post-erasure accuracy normalized by the baseline accuracy, and the y-axis displays the harmonic mean between all normalized specificity and coherence metrics. The star represents the goal zero accuracy and 100% specificity and coherence. (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), to simulate QA task. Given test question and candidate sentence as context, we evaluated the models confidence in classifying the candidate sentence as containing the answer to that question. Sentences that yielded an answer with confidence γ (we found γ = 0.3 to be optimal) for any test question were filtered out. 3. Intersection retained only the sentences that passed both the semantic and SQuAD filtering stages. Finally, where possible, we recombined the sentences into paragraphs. Manual Evaluation. We randomly sampled 5% of the paragraphs from the intersection set for each concept and manually evaluated them. None of the sampled paragraphs revealed answers to any of the test questions."

Across five concepts, we found that for PISCES, ELM, and RMU, these attacks had negligible or slightly negative effects on accuracy (mean effect on retained accuracy between 0.06 and 0.003), echoing prior reports of these methods robustness to adversarial attacks (Li et al., 2024a; Gandikota et al., 2025), and affirming PISCESs.
