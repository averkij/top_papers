            "content": "Accurate uncertainty quantification in LLMs is promising approach to improving trust and transparency towards humans (Geng et al., 2024). One alluring way to quantify uncertainty in LLMs is verbal confidence estimation, which simply asks the LLM to give its confidence after answering question (Damani et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a,b). Prior work suggests that verbal confidence can be reasonably calibrated across models and datasets, indicating that LLMs often possess meaningful awareness of their own uncertainty (Yoon et al., 2025; Xiong et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2022). Nonetheless, although models may be able to produce accurate verbal confidence estimates, we still do not perfectly understand the mechanisms behind why these abilities may emerge. One way Figure 1: The RiskEval Framework. We evaluate strategic abstention by prompting models with varying error penalties (λ) ranging from 0 to 100. Although models successfully verbalize uncertainty, they fail to translate this signal into decision-making. As illustrated, abstention rates on the HLE benchmark (Phan et al., 2025) remain largely invariant to increasing penalties. to approach this question is to ask whether verbal confidence estimates impact an LLMs actions or decisions in any way. In other words, are the generated confidence estimates faithful to the actions of the model? We examine this using an evaluation framework we term RiskEval, in which we allow model to answer or abstain on questions. We then measure its abstention rate for different penalty values given within the input prompt (see Figure 1). Combined with simultaneously eliciting the models verbal confidence scores, RiskEval provides sandbox for understanding whether these verbal confidence estimates are indeed faithful and consistent with the actions that the model takes. Our Contributions. We evaluate if LLMs utilize self-assessed verbal confidence to inform their decisions. Specifically, we test their ability to navigate the trade-off between answering and abstaining under penalties defined in the prompt. Our analysis reveals three main findings: Invariance to Risk. Across models and datasets, increasing penalties has negligible effect on model behavior. Neither the selfevaluated confidence nor the decision to answer or abstain changes significantly across incorrect answer penalties ranging in [0.1, 100]. This suggests that current training methods or model leaderboard practices do not result in risk-aware agents (Kalai et al., 2025). Utility Degradation. Models fail to maximize expected utility. In high-penalty regimes, the rigid answering-heavy policy leads to large losses compared to optimal post-hoc abstention strategies utilizing model reported verbal confidence scores. Decoupling of Confidence and Policy. Models often know their own uncertainty in the sense that the verbal confidence estimates are useful / calibrated yet mostly fail to convert this knowledge into good abstention policy. Despite prompted instructions to avoid penalties, models maintain high inclination to respond (Kirichenko et al., 2025). Overall, our investigations align with the need to evaluate models on strategic reliability rather than only overall accuracy (Kalai et al., 2025; Jia et al., 2024; Ross et al., 2024). Our findings also potentially call into question the validity and faithfulness of verbal confidence estimation for LLMs in decision-making contexts."

            "content": "We model answering and abstaining within utility maximization framework. Let be query, {answer, abstain} be the model Ms decision to answer or abstain, and be the models answer to if they decide to answer; = otherwise. Let be the ground-truth label. The model produces reported confidence estimate := cM(x) [0, 1], which we treat as its estimate of PM(y = yx), the models true underlying confidence. We introduce penalty parameter λ 0 for incorrect answers. The utility function for decision is defined as follows. When the model abstains = 0. When the model decides to answer, = +1 if the model is correct (i.e., = y), and = λ if the model is incorrect. rational agent that always maximizes expected utility only chooses to answer when the expected gain exceeds the utility of abstention, i.e., 0. This yields the optimal decision threshold τ (λ) = λ 1+λ , such that E[Uans] = 1 + (1 c)(λ) 0 = E[Uabs] when τ (λ). Define the binary action π {0, 1}, where π = 1 denotes answer and π = 0 denotes abstain. The Bayes-optimal policy under the models belief is (cid:18) (cid:19) π(c, λ) = . (1) λ 1 + λ We evaluate how well the models realized decisions align with π and how well confidence separates correct from incorrect answers. Policy Consistency (PC) measures the frequency with which the models actual decision πM aligns with the optimal policy π given the models own confidence c. Let be drawn from dataset D. PC(M, D) = ExD [I (πM(c, λ) = π(c, λ))] , where := cM(x) is the model verbal confidence. higher PC implies model better utilizes its own confidence to make decisions. Expected and Normalized Regret (R and R) quantify the utility lost due to suboptimal decisions. Importantly, this expectation is taken under the models stated belief ci, not the true conditional correctness probability. For single query, regret is the difference between the maximum possible expected utility and the actual expected utility achieved: = max(0, E[Uans]) E[UπM]. As explicitly derived in A, if the model answers when it should abstain (or vice versa), the regret is = (1 + λ) cM(x) τ (λ) I(πM = π). Since raw regret scales linearly with the penalty magnitude (1 + λ), we normalize it to measure decision error in probability space. This metric represents the distance between the models confidence and the optimal threshold: = 1 + λ = cM(x) τ (λ) I(πM = π). 2 Figure 2: Verbalized Confidence is Invariant to Risk. The flat trajectories show that internal uncertainty estimates remain stable despite increasing penalties, confirming that the failure to abstain is not due to signal degradation. Figure 3: Normalized Average Utility Collapses Under Risk. As penalties increase, normalized utility drops sharply into negative values on high-uncertainty benchmarks (HLE, GPQA). This confirms that models persist in answering incorrectly even when the cost of error far outweighs the potential reward. Area Under the Accuracy-Rejection Curve (AUARC). To assess confidence ranking quality independent of any specific λ, we compute AUARC. Let A(r) denote the accuracy on the retained set after discarding the lowest-confidence fraction for which AUARC = (cid:82) 1 0 A(r) dr. higher AUARC indicates that the model assigns lower confidence to incorrect answers. We defer more details and metrics to A. For each model and evaluation dataset D, we vary the penalty strength λ in the evaluation prompt to test both models confidence calibration and their decision-making strategies (see B.1)."

            "content": "Models and Datasets. We evaluate diverse set of models spanning different capability levels and reasoning styles. Please refer to for the full list of models. We evaluate them on three datasets spanning range of difficulties: HLE (Phan et al., 2025), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2024), and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Metrics and Evaluation. Using the RiskEval decision penalty framework in 2, we evaluate behavior using metrics defined in capturing realized performance, decision consistency with the optimal policy, and calibration quality. For each model and dataset, we use the prompts defined in B.1 to elicit either solely decision, or both decision and confidence score. We employ GPT-4o-mini as judge; we defer to B.1 for details and prompts. Main Results. Across all benchmarks, we observe that LLMs do not adapt their decision policies in response to changing risk, even when abstention is explicitly incentivized. Failure to Adapt Decision Rules. As penalties increase to regimes where optimal policies require widespread abstention, models continue to answer almost all questions. Correspondingly, Figure 4 shows high policy consistency at low penalties (λ 5), followed by abrupt degradation rather than smooth adjustment as penalties grow (λ 10). This indicates that models do not implement penalty-dependent decision thresholds; instead, they transition into unstable behavior without coherent abstention strategies. Low Abstention Rate Causes Utility Collapse. Because abstention remains low while error rates remain non-zero, model utility deteriorates rapidly as penalties increase. Figure 6 shows that mean normalized regret rises nearly monotonically with penalty on high-uncertainty benchmarks (HLE, GPQA), indicating large, avoidable losses relative to optimal policies. Figure 3 further demonstrates that penalty-normalized average points become strongly negative under high penalties. 3 Figure 4: Policy Consistency Collapses Under High Penalties. We measure how often model decisions align with the optimal policy induced by their confidence. The sharp drop on HLE and GPQA shows that models fail to adjust their decision thresholds τ (λ) as penalties rise, persisting in answering when abstention is optimal.

We report both Calibration metrics and Decision-Making metrics (Policy Consistency, and Penalty-Normalized Regret and Utility). Results are averaged over the high-penalty regime (λ 10) to highlight behavior under risk. Red and Blue indicate the best and second-best results. The significant gains from using the optimal policy π confirms that calibration signals are often useful for but not used by the models. Prompting Fails to Induce Abstention. Even when models are explicitly instructed to condition abstention decisions on internal uncertainty, behavior changes are negligible (see B.4). In our ablation study, we appended directive for models to [u]se this confidence to decide whether to answer or abstain to avoid penalties. Despite this, we observed invariant trajectories for both abstention rates and normalized regret compared to the baseline  (Fig. 7)  . Furthermore, differential analysis confirms that shifts in policy consistency were nearzero across benchmarks  (Fig. 8)  . This suggests that the observed rigidity is not due to underspecified instructions, but reflects deeper behavioral priors favoring always answering (Kirichenko et al., 2025). Scaffold with π Improves Utility. As discussed earlier, models fail to adhere to the mathematically optimal decision policy π, especially under highrisk regime. Its natural to introduce the scaffolding procedure: instead of relying on models own abstention policy πM, we instead enforce the optimal policy π post-hoc, using models verbal confidence and the known penalty level λ. As shown in Table 1, the π scaffolding could improve utility across models on HLE evaluation. This observation remains the same for low-risk environment (see Table 2) and easier tasks (GSM8K and GPQA Diamond, see Tables 3 to 6). Taken together, these results demonstrate critical dissociation between information availability and decision execution. While calibrationrelated metrics remain stable across models  (Fig. 5)  , decision-level outcomes exhibit limited policy variation and negative average utility  (Table 1)  . Moreover, increasing penalties does not substantially affect answer accuracy or reported confidence  (Fig. 2)  , indicating that the observed failures arise from lack of decision-level adaptation rather than changes in predictive behavior."

            "content": "Uncertainty Quantification for LLMs largely asks whether models can report reliable confidence, typically via ECE/reliability diagrams or related correlation metrics rather than downstream decision. Tian et al. (2023) shows that RLHF-tuned LMs often yield better-calibrated verbalized confi4 dence than raw token probabilities under standard QA-style evals. Subsequent work improves confidence estimation and evaluation via post-hoc calibration of verbalized probabilities (Zhang et al., 2024b) or identifies complementary uncertainty signals for reasoning models based on process features such as trace length (Devic et al., 2025a). Like our work, Devic et al. (2025b) also question the assumptions on whether calibrated uncertainty estimates are useful to human users, although in our work we stress that the uncertainty estimates may not even be faithful to actions taken by the LLM. Overall, this line establishes that confidence can be informative, but it rarely tests whether models use confidence to choose actions under changing utilities. Abstention and selective prediction in LLMs. Recent work studies abstention and selective answering in large language models to address safety, hallucination, and reliability concerns (Kalai et al., 2025; Kirichenko et al., 2025; Tayebati et al., 2025). Abstention methods concentrate at the alignment (Yang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Neeman et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023) and inference (Feng et al., 2024; Kapoor et al., 2024; Cole et al., 2023) stages. In contrast, we evaluate whether frozen LLM can adapt its abstention behavior to changing error penalties at inference time, isolating strategic adaptivity from learned refusal. Decision-theoretic and behavioral evaluation of LLM behavior. Prior studies quantify decisiontheoretic preferences such as risk attitudes and loss aversion, and compare LLM behavior against rational or human benchmarks (Jia et al., 2024; Ross et al., 2024). Related work further examines risksensitive and socially conditioned decision-making, documenting systematic deviations under different framings (Erdem and Ashok, 2026; Liu et al., 2025a; Xiao and Wang, 2025). In contrast, we test strategic responsiveness: whether frozen model adapts its answer-versus-abstain policy when the utility landscape changes."

            "content": "Our results demonstrate fundamental limitation in current LLMs: the disconnect between information and action. While models can often accurately verbalize their uncertainty, they fail to use this information to minimize loss. Even under severe penalties, models act as if the cost of error is negligible, leading to catastrophic utility collapse. This suggests that current safety training produces models that know they might be wrong but lack the agency or strategy to act on that risk. Ideally, reliable agent should exhibit consistency between its internal belief and its external action. The failure to achieve this consistency undermines the deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments where errors have real-world costs. Future work may therefore involve training methodologies that directly penalize risk-insensitive behavior (Ross et al., 2024), or inference-time frameworks like DeLLMa (Liu et al., 2025b) that mathematically enforce optimal decision boundaries. Ultimately, trustworthy model must do more than state its confidence; it must also act accordingly."

While prior work and our own calibration results suggest these estimates are useful, they may not perfectly capture the models true epistemic uncertainty.

It is possible that models true internal probability is better aligned with its decision to answer, even if its verbalized output is decoupled. Scope of Tasks. Our evaluation focuses on benchmarks (HLE, GPQA, GSM8K) where correctness is verifiable. The dynamics of confidence and abstention may differ in open-ended generation, creative writing, or dialogue tasks where utility and penalty are subjective and the boundary between correct and incorrect response is less defined."

We find the decision threshold τ (λ) where the expected utility is zero: c(1 + λ) λ = 0 = τ (λ) = λ 1 + λ Regret is defined as the difference between the optimal expected utility and the expected utility of the chosen action πM: = max(0, E[Uans]) E[UπM] We analyze the two failure modes where the models decision πM deviates from the optimal policy π. Case 1: Wrongful Answer (Overconfidence). The model answers (πM = ans) when it should have abstained (c < τ = E[Uans] < 0). = max(0, E[Uans]) E[Uans] = 0 (c(1 + λ) λ) = λ c(1 + λ) Substituting λ = τ (1 + λ) derived from the threshold condition: = τ (1 + λ) c(1 + λ) = (1 + λ)(τ c) = (1 + λ)τ (since τ > c) Case 2: Wrongful Abstention (Underconfidence). The model abstains (πM = abs) when it should have answered (c τ = E[Uans] 0). Substituting λ = τ (1 + λ): = max(0, E[Uans]) E[Uabs] = E[Uans] 0 = c(1 + λ) λ = c(1 + λ) τ (1 + λ) = (1 + λ)(c τ ) = (1 + λ)c τ (since τ ) In both failure cases, the raw regret scales linearly with the penalty magnitude Normalization. (1 + λ). To obtain penalty-agnostic metric that reflects the decision error in probability space, we normalize by (1 + λ). The Normalized Regret is thus defined as: := 1 + λ = τ (λ) I(πM = π) 8 This metric captures the absolute distance between the models confidence and the optimal decision boundary whenever suboptimal decision is made. In the following paragraphs, unless otherwise stated, all metrics are reported as function of the penalty parameter λ. We first start with Outcome-Based Performance Metrics. These metrics evaluate empirical outcomes under the utility function defined in Section 2, without re-deriving the underlying decision logic. Let for some evaluation dataset D. Unless otherwise stated, let := M(x) be the models answer to query x, and be the ground truth label to query x. Abstention Rate. We define AbsRate measuring the fraction of instances on which the model abtains from answering the query as follows, AbsRate(M, D) = ExD (cid:2)I(cid:0)πM(x) = 0(cid:1)(cid:3). Accuracy (Answered). We define accuracy on answered queries as the expected correctness conditional on the models decision to answer: Accuracy = [I(πM(x) = 1) I(y = y)] [I(πM(x) = 1)] This metric measures the reliability of the model specifically for the subset of questions it chooses to engage with. Average Utility. We first define our metric of average utility when evaluating model and dataset as follows, Uλ(M, D) = ExDUλ (cid:0)πM(x), y), y(cid:1), where Uλ() is the utility function defined in Section 2 for given penalty λ for errors. This metric represents the empirical expected score under penalty λ. As penalty λ increases, the utility Uλ() will change according similar to the regret defined earlier. We use the same normalization scheme for average utility as well. We define penalty-normalize average utility (short as Normalized Utility) as follows, Uλ(M, D) = 1 1 + λ Uλ(M, D). Decision-Making Metrics. The decision-making metrics, as the core essense of this study, such as Policy Consistency (PC), Expected Regret (R), and Normalized Regret (R), evaluate whether the models decisions are consistent with the optimal policy induced by its own confidence estimates, as derived in Section 2. Finally, we introduce metrics to evaluate the quality of the models verbalized confidence estimates cM(x) independently of the specific decision threshold τ (λ). These metrics assess how well the reported confidence reflects the true probability of correctness. Expected Calibration Error (ECE-10) . ECE measures the expected absolute difference between the models confidence and its empirical accuracy. We partition the probability interval [0, 1] into = 10 equal-width bins. Let Bk denote the set of indices for samples where the reported confidence falls into the k-th bin, and let be the total number of instances where the model provided an answer. The ECE is defined as: ECE = (cid:88) k=1 Bk acc(Bk) conf(Bk) , where acc(Bk) is the average accuracy of predictions in bin k, and conf(Bk) is the average confidence of predictions in bin k. Figure 5: Internal Uncertainty Estimates Are Invariant to Risk. We analyze four calibration-related metrics across HLE, GPQA, and GSM8K as the penalty for wrong answers (λ) increases. (Top row) Verbalized confidence does not drop, proving models do not act conservatively by lowering confidence. (Rows 2-4) Calibration quality (AUARC, ECE, Brier) remains stable. This confirms that the failure to abstain is not caused by signal degradation or loss of calibration under pressure; the signal exists, but the decision policy fails to use it. Brier Score. The Brier score is strictly proper scoring rule that measures the mean squared error between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes. Let xi be the i-th query in the evaluation set of size , and let oi = I(yi = ) be the binary correctness indicator for the models answer yi. The Brier score is given by: Brier ="

All reported metrics are computed according to the definitions in Section A. Models and Datasets. We include several API models commonly used in downstream applications: GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano (OpenAI, 2025a), GPT-4.1-mini (OpenAI, 2025b), Gemini-3-Flash 10 (Google, 2025), and Gemini-2.5-Flash (Gemini Team, Google, 2025). We also evaluate open Llama-4-Maverick (Meta AI, 2025), Gemma-3n (Gemma Team, 2025), and instruct models: DeepSeek-V3.2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025). Finally, we include open models that explicitly perform reasoning: DeepSeek-V3.2-Thinking (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) and Qwen-3-Next-Thinking (Qwen Team, 2025). We use the full GPQA Diamond dataset, while for HLE and GSM8K we evaluate on fixed subset of 128 examples for each penalty setting. Evaluation Pipeline. We evaluate models using three-stage pipeline consisting of solver, parser, and judge. These components are implemented as separate model calls to ensure strict isolation between answer generation, answer extraction, and correctness assessment. 1. Solver stage. The solver receives the input question together with an explicit scoring rule specifying penalty parameter λ. The solver is instructed to either provide an answer with an associated confidence estimate or to abstain. Importantly, the solver never observes ground-truth labels, optimal thresholds, or any feedback about correctness. 2. Parser stage. The parser extracts structured fields from the solvers free-form output, including: (a) final decision (answer or ABSTAIN), (b) numeric confidence score in [0, 1], and (c) the committed answer text. This stage is designed to be robust to heterogeneous output formats, including numeric or verbal confidence expressions and long-form reasoning traces."

This separation prevents information leakage and ensures that solver behavior reflects single-shot decision under the stated incentive structure. Prompting and Penalty Conditioning. For each evaluation run, the penalty parameter λ is explicitly included in the solvers system prompt. The prompt specifies that correct answer yields +1, an incorrect answer yields λ, and abstention yields 0. Apart from this scalar penalty, the prompt remains fixed across values of λ. We evaluate two prompt strategies: 1. base strategy: You are careful expert test-taker. Scoring: +1 for correct answer, -λ for an incorrect answer, and 0 for ABSTAIN. Provide your best answer in your own words and state your confidence level (numeric). 2. use-confidence strategy: You are careful expert test-taker. Scoring: +1 for correct answer, -λ for an incorrect answer, and 0 for ABSTAIN. Provide your best answer in your own words and state your confidence level (numeric). Use your confidence to decide whether to answer or ABSTAIN. If you are not confident enough, you should respond with ABSTAIN to avoid the penalty. No dataset-specific prompt tuning or penalty-dependent prompt rewriting is performed. Datasets and Modalities. We support both text-only and multimodal datasets. For multimodal benchmarks, images are provided to the solver either as base64-encoded data URLs or as in-memory image objects, depending on the API requirements of the underlying model. If dataset item contains an image and the evaluated model does not support vision input, the item is skipped. For datasets where some items lack definitive gold answer, those items are excluded from calibrationrelated metrics (e.g., ECE, Brier score) but are still included in coverage and abstention statistics. Confidence Handling. Confidence estimates may be expressed numerically or verbally. Verbal expressions are mapped to numeric probabilities using fixed, deterministic mapping defined prior to evaluation. Confidence scores are treated as the models internal estimate = P(y = x) and are never recalibrated post hoc. For calibration metrics, confidence values are discretized into 10 equal-width bins over [0, 1]. All binning is performed after parsing and judging, and independently for each penalty value. Optimal Policy and Post-hoc Analysis. The optimal abstention threshold τ (λ) = λ 1+λ is never revealed to the model. Thresholds, regret, and policy-consistency measures are computed post hoc using the models reported confidence. This allows us to assess whether models internally adapt their decision rules as penalties change, rather than whether they can follow an externally supplied rule.

Red and Blue indicate the best and second-best results. Execution and Reproducibility. All evaluations are run with deterministic settings wherever supported by the underlying APIs. Results are written incrementally to disk after each evaluated item, enabling exact resumption of interrupted runs without recomputation. Each experiment is fully specified by configuration file that records: model identifiers and providers, dataset source and split, penalty values, prompt strategy, maximum output length, and evaluation subset size (if any). These configuration files, together with raw per-item outputs and aggregated metrics, are sufficient to reproduce all reported results. B.2 Confidence and Calibration In this section, we analyze the stability and quality of the models internal uncertainty signals. Our primary finding is that the models failure to abstain is not caused by degradation in the uncertainty signal itself. Invariance of Confidence. As shown in Figure 5, the average verbalized confidence remains remarkably stable across all penalty levels (λ). This invariance is desirable property: it indicates that the models internal estimation of correctness (y = yx) remains faithful to the semantic content of the answer, uncorrupted by the external incentive structure. The flat trajectories across HLE, GPQA, and GSM8K confirm that the models do not hallucinate higher or lower confidence in response to risk. Stability of Calibration Metrics. We further validate the quality of these signals using standard calibration metrics in Figure 5.

Similarly, Expected Calibration Error (ECE-10) and Brier scores do not show significant degradation as λ increases. Its also interesting to see frontier models such as GPT-5 series and Gemini-3-Flash are well calibrated on simpler tasks such as GPQA and GSM8K. B.3 Utility and Regret In this section, we analyze model performance through two outcome-level quantities: the average (unnormalized) utility and the mean penalty-normalized regret R. We found that as the penalty for incorrect answers increases, models incur rapidly deteriorating utility while simultaneously accumulating large, systematic regret relative to the optimal policy. These two signals and together expose fundamental failure of risk-sensitive decision-making. Utility Collapse. As shown in Fig. 6 and Tables 2 - 6, average utility remains near zero or mildly positive only at very low penalty levels, but collapses sharply once the penalty λ enters moderate-to-high regimes, quickly becoming strongly negative. This behavior is most pronounced on high-uncertainty benchmarks such as HLE and GPQA Diamond, where even modest error rates become prohibitively costly under larger penalties. similar but delayed pattern appears on GSM8K, consistent with its lower intrinsic uncertainty.

In contrast to Table 5, in this table, we only average metrics in high-penalty regime where λ 10. We find that the optimal policy π can give significantly more benefits in utility under this regime. Regret Accumulation. At the same time, penalty-normalized regret increases monotonically with λ across all datasets. The rise in regret indicates that the observed utility loss is largely avoidable: as the cost of error increases, models deviate progressively further from the optimal policy π that would maximize expected utility under the same scoring rule. This divergence is especially large in high-penalty regimes, where abstention should dominate but models continue to answer broadly. The tabular results make this gap explicit. Across both full-penalty averages and high-penalty subsets, the utility achieved under the models actual behavior (πM) is consistently and often substantially lower than the counterfactual utility achievable by optimally following the models own confidence signal (π). In several cases, π yields near-zero or positive utility precisely where πM incurs large negative values, aligning closely with the observed growth in R. B.4 Ablation Study In this section, we perform prompting-based ablation study by adding an additional instruction sentence requesting models to use their confidence to make the final decision. Specifically, the extra prompt sentence write Use this confidence to decide whether to answer or ABSTAIN to avoid the penalty. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, this explicit instruction fails to induce strategic behavior. In particular, as shown in Figure 7, the trajectories for Abstention Rate, Normalized Regret, and Policy Consistency are nearly identical to the baseline (Figures 3 and 4). Models continue to answer despite the explicit warning to use confidence to avoid penalties. Also as shown in Figure 8, we measure the delta () in average confidence and policy consistency between the baseline and the ablation prompt. it shows that changes are negligible (mostly near 0.0), indicating that the instruction does not significantly shift the models internal threshold or confidence distribution."

Comparing these results to the baseline, we observe negligible differences in (a) abstention rates, (b) normalized regret, and (c) policy consistency. This confirms that the failure to adapt to risk is robust to simple instruction tuning. (a) Average Confidence with use_confidence prompt (b) Policy Consistency with use_confidence prompt Figure 8: Explicit Instructions Fail to Improve Strategic Abstention. We evaluate the impact of adding an explicit instruction for models to use their confidence to decide whether to abstain (Appendix B.4). Comparing the Use Confidence prompt to the baseline, we observe minimal changes in models verbal confidence and policy consistency. This invariance confirms that the failure to adapt to risk is not due to misunderstood instructions but reflects deeper inability to operationalize uncertainty into decision-making."
