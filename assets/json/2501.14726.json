The unique challenge for relighting full-body avatars lies in the large deformations caused by body articulation and the resulting impact on appearance caused by light transport. Changes in body pose can dramatically change the orientation of body surfaces with respect to lights, resulting in both local appearance changes due to changes in local light transport functions, as well as non-local changes due to occlusion between body parts. To address this, we decompose the light transport into local and non-local effects. Local appearance changes are modeled using learnable zonal harmonics for diffuse radiance transfer. Unlike spherical harmonics, zonal harmonics are highly efficient to rotate under articulation. This allows us to learn diffuse radiance transfer in a local coordinate frame, which disentangles the local radiance transfer from the articulation of the body. To account for non-local appearance changes, we introduce a shadow network that predicts shadows given precomputed incoming irradiance on a base mesh.

            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Building drivable full-body avatars is long-standing challenge in computer vision and graphics. Early approaches focused on reconstructing the geometry and appearance of the human body for free-viewpoint rendering and video playback [Collet et al. 2015; Prada et al. 2017; Starck and Hilton 2007]. While achieving highfidelity appearance and geometry, these methods are limited in their ability to animate the avatars under novel illumination conditions. Later works recover intrinsic properties of the human body [Guo et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2021], face [Bi et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2023], and hands [Chen et al. 2024b; Iwase et al. 2023] to enable animation and relighting. Among these approaches, [Chen et al. 2024b; Guo et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2021] employ mesh-based representations, which often fail to model translucency and fine-scale geometric details such as hair. [Iwase et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023] employ mixture of volumetric primitives [Lombardi et al. 2021] that better captures fine-scale geometric detail compared to mesh-based representations, but tends to blur out certain geometric detail such as individual hair strands. On the other hand, most religthtable appearance representations are also suboptimal: [Guo et al. 2019] employs physically based rendering model that omits global illumination due to performance concern, thus producing unrealistic human skins. [Bi et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2024b; Iwase et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2021] utilize neural relighting to predict relit appearance given the illumination as input. These approaches ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: January 2025. can capture global illumination effects but often produce blurry appearance due to the limited expressiveness of the employed neural network. Contrary to the aforementioned approaches, [Saito et al. 2024] explores 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023]) to represent the geometry and appearance of head avatars and could represent highly detailed geometry such as individual hair strands. The approach also employs learnable radiance transfer function to account for global illumination effects. The learned radiance transfer leverages spherical harmonics to model diffuse shading ( [Sloan et al. 2002]) and to capture low-frequency global illumination effects such as subsurface scattering of human skin. In addition, specular radiance transfer is modeled based on spherical Gaussian model [Green et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2009] to account for all-frequency illumination effects, such as eye glints and skin reflections. Both components are directly compatible with conventional real-time rendering engines. In this paper, we propose Relightable Full-Body Gaussian Codec Avatars, the first approach to jointly model the relightable appearance of the body, face, and hands of drivable avatars. We build upon the insights of [Saito et al. 2024], using 3DGS as the underlying representation, while employing learned radiance transfer to model relightable appearance. We note that there are several challenges to extend the appearance model of [Saito et al. 2024] to handle fully articulated bodies: (1) the diffuse light transport model based on spherical harmonics in [Saito et al. 2024] assumes that light sources can be mapped to single local coordinate frame (i.e., the head coordinate frame), which does not hold for articulated bodies, where each body part has its own local coordinate frame. (2) Articulated bodies also exhibit complex shadowing effects caused by occlusions between body parts, which are not considered in [Saito et al. 2024]. (3) Full-body models usually have limited representational budget for modeling facial details compared to head-specific methods. Naive splatting restricts resolution to the local Gaussian density, requiring many Gaussians for fine details. Moreover, because the resolution for specular reflections depends on both surface properties and the environments frequency content, modeling specularities at the Gaussian level forces an undesirable link between reflection frequency and Gaussian density, resulting in an under-representation of facial details such as eye glints. To address the first challenge, we replace the diffuse light transport model based on spherical harmonic with zonal harmonics [Sloan et al. 2005], representation that can be learned in the local coordinate frame and efficiently rotated to world coordinates, yielding distinct light transport effects for different body articulations with single parameterization. In particular, zonal harmonics enable us to construct radiance transfer functions in world coordinates by efficiently rotating learned zonal harmonics parameters, circumventing the need to map light sources to the local coordinate frames of each body part. Regarding shadow modeling, several recent full-body avatar works have proposed to use ray tracing to account for shadowing effects [Chen et al. 2024c; Chen and Liu 2022; Li et al. 2024b; Lin et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2024]. They require expensive ray tracing of several rays per pixel at each optimization step in order to capture the shadows cast by intricate structures such as cloth wrinkles. In contrast, our learned radiance transfer function captures local shadows well but struggles with non-local shadows caused by distant self-occlusions. We thus propose to learn shadow network that is dedicated to predict the shadows caused by body articulation, given as input the normalized incoming irradiance on coarse-tracked mesh. The shadow network is inspired by [Bagautdinov et al. 2021] but is adapted to the setting of relightable appearance model. Specifically, we ensure that the irradiance is normalized in physically based way, such that the learned shadow network generalizes to novel illumination conditions. Lastly, to address the reduced quality in specular rendering, we take inspiration from deferred shading [Deering et al. 1988; Gao et al. 2020; Thies et al. 2019; Ye et al. 2024] and propose to model specular radiance transfer with deferred shading, which achieves high-fidelity specular reflections for the face region. In summary, we make the following contributions: We propose the first relightable full-body avatar model that jointly models the relightable appearance of the human body, face, and hands for high-fidelity relighting and animation. To handle full-body articulations with global light transport, we propose learnable zonal harmonics to represent local diffuse radiance transfer in the local coordinate frames of each Gaussian. This results in reduced number of parameters and improved rendering quality compared to the commonly used spherical harmonics representation. We reformulate the learnable radiance transfer to explicitly decompose non-local shadowing, and propose dedicated shadow network to predict shadows caused by the articulation of the body. We also propose physically based irradiance normalization scheme to ensure that the shadow network can generalize to novel illumination conditions such as unseen environment maps. We show that deferred shading can be used for our learned specular radiance transfer function. This achieves high-fidelity specular reflections for relightable human avatar modeling without excessively increasing the number of Gaussians."

            "content": "Mesh-based representations are popular because they provide native integration with existing graphics pipelines [Loper et al. 2015]. Existing approaches for building mesh-based animatable avatar models use poseand latent-code conditioned neural networks to predict textures and geometry deformations in UV space [Bagautdinov et al. 2021; Grigorev et al. 2019; Xiang et al. 2022, 2023] or on top of graph-based representations [Habermann et al. 2021]. More faithful reconstructions require more expressive representations than meshes. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al. 2021] have powered number of methods for neural rendering of human bodies [Jiang et al. 2022; Li et al. 2022b; Liu et al. 2021; Peng et al. 2021; Su et al. 2022, 2021; Wang et al. 2022; Weng et al. 2022]. These methods typically employ NeRF conditioned on human motion, either in world or canonical space, by warping the rays with an articulated model for better generalization. On the other hand, they are often limited by the slow training/inference speed of Relightable Full-Body Gaussian Codec Avatars 3 NeRF. [Chen et al. 2023; Remelli et al. 2022] utilize an efficient variant of NeRF, i.e. mixture of volumetric primitives [Lombardi et al. 2021] to enable both faithful reconstruction and real-time rendering. Aside from NeRF, point-based representations [Prokudin et al. 2023; Su et al. 2023; Zheng et al. 2023] allow for more flexible topology modeling and exploit the notion of locality, which leads to more parameter-efficient models and better generalization. Most recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting [Kerbl et al. 2023] (3DGS) enabled both the high-performance of point-based representations and the expressiveness of radiance fields by modeling the scene with learnable Gaussian primitives. 3DGS has been extended to support dynamic scenes [Luiten et al. 2023], and subsequently several works introduced neural representations [Hu and Liu 2024; Li et al. 2024c; Pang et al. 2024; Qian et al. 2024; Zielonka et al. 2023] incorporating 3DGS-based appearance with articulated geometry priors to enable animatable full-body models. [Zielonka et al. 2023] embeds Gaussian primitives into tetrahedral cages, as opposed to commonly used linear blend skinning geometry proxy, with compositional payload produced by pose-conditioned MLPs. [Li et al. 2024c; Pang et al. 2024] parameterize the Gaussian primitives on pre-defined UV texture space, and deploys convolutional network in UV-space to decode highly detailed pose-dependent Gaussian appearance and deformations. [Hu and Liu 2024; Qian et al. 2024] map set of Gaussians - initialized with SMPL [Loper et al. 2015] template in canonical space, using standard linear blend skinning (LBS) model coupled with learnable non-rigid deformation model. In this work, we also build upon 3DGS due to its efficiency and expressiveness. We note that most of the aforementioned methods focus on animation and novel view synthesis, while perceptually realistic relighting of full-body avatars is rarely explored in the literature, as discussed in the next section."

            "content": "Recent portrait relighting methods [Ji et al. 2022; Kanamori and Endo 2018; Kim et al. 2024; Pandey et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2019] employ learning-based techniques operating in image space. [Sun et al. 2019] uses an encoder-decoder neural network trained on light stage data to regress the subjects appearance under novel illumination conditions. [Kim et al. 2024] proposes an image-space approach that incorporates physics-based decomposition and relies on self-supervised pre-training to improve generalization from limited light-stage data. [He et al. 2024] employs diffusion models [Ho et al. 2020; Rombach et al. 2022; Song et al. 2021a,b] to predict relit images of human faces given conditioning face images and light information. Although promising, image-based techniques often produce geometrically and temporally inconsistent results due to their limited ability to model 3D consistency. Physically based rendering (PBR) techniques aim at estimating approximate properties of the underlying material based on an approximate physics model. Relightables [Guo et al. 2019] recover detailed intrinsic properties of the human body from light-stage data using mesh and PBR appearance model. Relighting4D [Chen and Liu 2022] aims to obtain relightable avatars from sparse-view or monocular videos with unknown light sources using physically based decomposition of the scene, where the neural fields produce ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: January 2025. 4 Wang, S. et al normal, occlusion, diffuse, and specular components rendered with physically based renderer. Later works [Chen et al. 2024c; Li et al. 2024b; Lin et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2024; Zheng et al. 2024] learn such avatars in canonical spaces to facilitate animation while employing explicit ray tracing to enhance the realism of relighting. In general, PBR is not designed for efficient modeling of global illumination effects which are crucial for rendering perceptually realistic images. Rendering global illumination effects with PBR requires multi-bounce path tracing which is prohibitively slow for gradient-based optimization of dynamic avatar models. [Bi et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2021] propose to use neural relighting along with 3D head model to achieve global illumination effects while being 3D consistent. Neural relighting with shadow conditioning has also been explored for relightable hands [Chen et al. 2024b; Iwase et al. 2023] exhibit more articulation compared to the human head, but their bottleneck-based neural relighting methods with mesh or mixture of volumetric primitives are unable to capture high-frequency specularities and geometric details as shown in [Saito et al. 2024]. Contrary to all aforementioned methods, our approach utilizes 3D-consistent representation [Kerbl et al. 2023] with learnable radiance transfer functions [Saito et al. 2024] to model the relightable appearance. This ensures 3D-consistent and high-fidelity relighting of full-body avatars in an efficient manner, for both seen and unseen poses."

            "title": "2.3 Learned Radiance Transfer",
            "content": "Modeling global illumination effects is long-standing challenge in computer graphics [Pharr et al. 2023]. While PBR with Monte Carlo path tracing is the most accurate method for rendering global illumination effects, it is not amenable to real-time applications due to its high computational cost. To address this, precomputed radiance transfer (PRT) [Sloan et al. 2002] has been proposed for real-time rendering of global illumination effects. PRT approximates the light transport function using set of compact basis functions such as spherical harmonics (SH), which reduces shading computations to simple dot products between the SH coefficients of the illumination and the transfer coefficients. Follow-up works have extended PRT to handle all frequency lighting [Green et al. 2006; Ng et al. 2003; Tsai and Shih 2006; Wang et al. 2009] and learning via neural networks [Lyu et al. 2022; Rainer et al. 2022; Xu et al. 2022]. Regarding dynamic scenes such as dynamic human heads, both [Li et al. 2022a] and [Saito et al. 2024] learn diffuse light transport functions as sets of spherical harmonic coefficients. We find that this representation is not sufficient to capture diffuse appearance changes due to fullbody articulations. Inspired by [Sloan et al. 2005], we choose Zonal Harmonics (ZH) to construct orientation-dependent light transport functions. Instead of aligning zonal harmonics with known SH coefficients as in [Sloan et al. 2005], we propose to learn zonal harmonics directly from light stage data in an end-to-end manner, together with the other intrinsic properties. They can yield distinct light transport functions efficiently given different orientations of the primitives. This allows us to learn complex, orientation-dependent light transport for full-body avatars from image observations only. The learned view-dependent specular radiance transfer of [Saito et al. 2024] based on spherical Gaussians [Wang et al. 2009], on the ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: January 2025. other hand, can be directly applied to full-body avatars by mapping camera viewing directions into local coordinate frames of 3D Gaussians. However, we observe that this approach performs poorly in highly specular regions when the number of Gaussians is limited. To address this, we propose to combine deferred shading with the learnable radiance transfer by rasterizing not only physically based properties (roughness and normals) but also light transport coefficients (visibility). While deferred shading has been explored with 3DGS [Ye et al. 2024], we are the first to utilize it for learnable radiance transfer."

            "content": ", z𝑚 𝑘 We represent full-body avatar as collection of 3D Gaussians and employ 3D Gaussian splatting [Kerbl et al. 2023] to render the avatar. Similarly to [Saito et al. 2024], we associate Gaussian primitive with properties g𝑘 = {t𝑘, R𝑘, s𝑘, 𝑜𝑘, 𝜌𝑘, z𝑐 , n𝑘, 𝑣𝑘, 𝜎𝑘 }. The geometry 𝑘 of the primitive is defined by translation t𝑘 R3, rotation R𝑘 𝑆𝑂 (3) represented as quaternion, per-axis scales s𝑘 R3, and an opacity value 𝑜𝑘 [0, 1]. The appearance is defined by albedo 𝜌𝑘 R3, diffuse light transport coefficients z𝑐 𝑘 , specular 𝑘 normal n𝑘 S2, specular visibility 𝑣𝑘 [0, 1], and roughness 𝜎𝑘 . The geometry of the 𝑘-th Gaussian primitive is modeled as an unnormalized 3D Gaussian kernel G𝑘 : , z𝑚 G𝑘 (x) = exp (cid:18) 1 2 (x t𝑘 )𝑇 Σ1 𝑘 (x t𝑘 ) (cid:19) , (1) s.t. Σ𝑘 = R𝑘 diag(s)diag(s)𝑇 𝑇 𝑘 In order to render pixels in image space, [Kerbl et al. 2023] uses an additional function (G𝑘, 𝑢, 𝑣) that projects the 3D Gaussian primitive onto the image plane [Zwicker et al. 2002], and evaluates the Gaussian kernel value at the projected pixel location (𝑢, 𝑣). The final color of pixel is computed by blending the colors of all Gaussians, sorted by their depth wrt. the camera: C(𝑢, 𝑣) = 𝑘= c𝑘𝑜𝑘 (G𝑘, 𝑢, 𝑣) 𝑘 1 (cid:214) 𝑗=1 (1 𝑜 𝑗 (G𝑗 , 𝑢, 𝑣)) (2) where c𝑘 is the color of the 𝑘-th Gaussian. Note that in our approach, we render the diffuse color with Eq. (2), but use deferred shading for rendering specular color (Sec. 3.2.2). Similar to [Bagautdinov et al. 2021; Remelli et al. 2022], we parameterize rendering primitives (in our case, 3D Gaussians) on UV texture map of tracked human template mesh. Given 3D body and face keypoints at frame, we transform them according to the inverse transformations of the body root and the face root, respectively, and denote them as K𝑏, K𝑓 . We then encode the keypoints into latent space and decode them into Gaussian primitives {g𝑘 }𝑀 𝑘=1. Formally, encoder and viewindependent decoder D𝑐𝑖 are defined as: 𝑘 , 𝛿n𝑘 }𝑀 𝑚 𝑐 𝑘, {𝛿t𝑘, 𝛿R𝑘, s𝑘, 𝑜𝑘, l𝑏, l𝑓 = (K𝑏, K𝑓 ; Θ𝑒 ) 𝑘=1 = D𝑐𝑖 (l𝑏, l𝑓 ; Θ𝑐𝑖 ) (3) (4) Relightable Full-Body Gaussian Codec Avatars 5 Fig. 2. Overview of our approach. Given body latent code l𝑏 and face latent code l𝑓 computed by keypoint encoder and canonicalized viewing directions ˆ𝜔𝑜 as input, we decode the geometry parameters of 3D Gaussians {R𝑘, s𝑘, t𝑘, 𝑜𝑘 } (Sec. 3.1), and appearance parameters consisting of light transport coefficients {z𝑐 𝑘 }, normals {n𝑘 }, roughness {𝜎𝑘 }, and specular visibility {𝑣𝑘 } (Sec. 3.2). We integrate the light with diffuse light transport coefficients to 𝑘 yield per-Gaussian diffuse color, while using deferred shading to compute specular color. The final color is modulated by shadow map predicted by shadow network (Sec. 3.3). , z𝑚 where l𝑏 and l𝑓 are body and face latent codes predicted by the encoder. The encoder and the view-independent decoder D𝑐𝑖 are parameterized by Θ𝑒 and Θ𝑐𝑖 , respectively. In contrast to the face modeling approach of [Saito et al. 2024], the human body exhibits much greater degree of articulation. We thus propose to predict delta translation (𝛿t𝑘 ) and rotation (𝛿R𝑘 ) of each Gaussian primitive in local coordinate frame, which is defined by the corresponding tangent-bitangent-normal (TBN) space of the tracked mesh. Since each Gaussian is associated with texel of the texture map, we have TBN transformation for each Gaussian primitive. Let the TBN transformation for texel 𝑘 be TBN𝑘 = [t𝑘, b𝑘, n𝑘 ], where column vectors t𝑘, b𝑘, n𝑘 represent the tangent, bitangent, and normal at the texel 𝑘. Let the 3D world coordinate of the texel 𝑘 be v𝑘 . The translation and rotation of each Gaussian primitive in the world coordinate frame is then: t𝑘 = v𝑘 + TBN𝑘 𝛿t𝑘 R𝑘 = TBN𝑘 𝛿R𝑘 (5) (6) where denotes the matrix-matrix/matrix-vector multiplication. We transform the quaternion 𝛿R𝑘 to rotation matrix before applying the TBN transformation, and then convert the resulting R𝑘 back to quaternion."

            "content": "We follow the framework of [Saito et al. 2024] which models the relightable appearance of human face by combining diffuse light transport based on spherical harmonics with spherical-Gaussianbased specular light transport. While [Saito et al. 2024] inversely maps incident light to the local coordinate frame of head and compute diffuse shading in that local coordinate frame, it is difficult to apply the same technique in the full-body scenario. This is not only because of the additional computational cost for mapping lights into local coordinate frames of multiple body parts, but also because accurately modeling inverse mappings for body joints is challenging. It is thus preferable to rotate light transport functions to the world coordinate, and compute diffuse shading in the world coordinate. For specular light transport, we note that we cannot afford to use the same number of Gaussian primitives for the face, compared to face-specific models. This results in an under-representation of specular highlights in the face region. In the following, we describe how to learn the diffuse transport coefficients in the local coordinate frame of each Gaussian primitive, which can be subsequently transformed to the world coordinate frame using the Gaussian rotation matrix. We then describe deferred shading scheme for specular light transport to improve the rendering quality of specular highlights. 3.2.1 Zonal Harmonics for Diffuse Appearance. Following [Saito et al. 2024], the diffuse color of the 𝑘-th Gaussian primitive is defined as: 𝑑 𝑘 = 𝜌𝑘 S2 L(𝜔𝑖 )d𝑘 (𝜔𝑖 )d𝜔𝑖 = 𝜌𝑘 (𝑛+1) 2 𝑖=1 𝑖 L𝑖 𝑘 (7) ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: January 2025. 6 Wang, S. et al 𝑘 } (𝑛+1) 2 𝑖=1 in which 𝜔𝑖 S2 is the surface-to-light direction. = {L𝑖 } (𝑛+1) 2 and d𝑘 = {d𝑖 are the incident light and light transport coefficients represented as 𝑛-th order SH coefficients, respectively. Both L𝑖 and d𝑖 𝑘 are in R3. 𝜌𝑘 R3 is the albedo for primitive 𝑘. Albedos are defined and optimized directly on the UV texture map. denotes the element-wise multiplication. 𝑖= As discussed previously, we would like to rotate SH coefficients to the world coordinate instead of mapping incident light to the local coordinate frames of body parts. An immediate challenge is that rotating SH coefficients is prohibitively expensive, especially for high-order SHs (we use 𝑛 = 8 in our experiments). The amortized complexity of rotating SH coefficients is 𝑂 (𝑛3) for 𝑛th order SH. To address this challenge, we take inspiration from [Sloan et al. 2005] and use Zonal Harmonics (ZHs) to model the appearance of each Gaussian primitive in its local coordinate frame. ZHs are subset of SHs that are circularly symmetric around specified direction. In the simplest case, {d𝑖 can be represented as function of arbitrary direction 𝜔 S2, using single set of ZH coefficients {z𝑙 𝑘 } (𝑛+1) 2 𝑖=1 𝑘 }𝑛 𝑙=0: 𝑙 𝑖 𝑘𝑌𝑙𝑚 (𝜔) 𝑘 (𝜔) = s.t. 𝑙 = 0, , 𝑛, 𝑚 = 𝑙, , 𝑙 𝑖 = 𝑙 2 + 𝑙 + 𝑚 + where 𝑌𝑙𝑚 is the SH basis function that maps spherical direction onto the SH basis specified by (𝑙, 𝑚). In this case, we predict only 𝑘 }𝑛 𝑘 for all 𝑚 values given fixed 𝑙. The ZH coefficients {z𝑙 single z𝑙 𝑙=0 are agnostic to the orientation of the primitive, which essentially represents the light transport properties of the primitive in local coordinate frame. Though efficient in yielding rotated SH coefficients, the expressiveness of single ZH is limited in that Eq. (8) can only represent functions that are circularly symmetric around 𝜔. Thus in practice, we predict three sets of colored ZH coefficients, together denoted z𝑘 R33𝑙 for texel 𝑘. d𝑘 is represented as the sum of these ZH basis functions evaluated at the tangent, bitangent, and normal directions of the Gaussian primitive, respectively: 𝑘 𝑌𝑙𝑚 (ˆt𝑘 ) + z1𝑙 𝑘 𝑌𝑙𝑚 ( ˆb𝑘 ) + z2𝑙 𝑘 = z0𝑙 𝑖 s.t. 𝑙 = 0, , 𝑛, 𝑚 = 𝑙, , 𝑙 𝑘 𝑌𝑙𝑚 ( ˆn𝑘 ) (9) 𝑖 = 𝑙 2 + 𝑙 + 𝑚 + The tangent ˆt𝑘 , bitangent ˆb𝑘 , and normal ˆn𝑘 directions are defined as the first, second, and third columns of R𝑘 (Eq. (6)), respectively. We represent colored ZHs (z𝑐 𝑘 ) up to the 3rd order while using monochromatic ZHs (z𝑚 𝑘 ) from the 4-th to 8-th order. Specular Appearance. In this subsection, we describe how to 3.2.2 model the specular appearance of the Gaussian primitives. The general framework is similar to [Saito et al. 2024] but with modifications to adapt to full-body modeling. We associate the specular normal vectors with the geometry of the Gaussian primitives, to obtain high-quality specular normals, especially for modeling clothes. We also employ deferred shading to better capture specular highlights due to using limited number of Gaussians compared to face-only models. ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: January 2025. (8) The final screen space normal is defined as n𝑢𝑣 = n𝑢𝑣/ n𝑢𝑣 2. 𝜎𝑢𝑣, and 𝑣𝑢𝑣 are obtained similarly but without the normalization step. Specular normal: The normal vector n𝑘 is crucial for modeling the specular appearance of the Gaussian primitive. We found that associating the normal vector with the last column of the Gaussian primitives rotation matrix (i.e. ˆn𝑘 from Eq. (9)) achieves high-quality results. Formally: n𝑘 = ( ˆn𝑘 + 𝛿n𝑘 )/ ˆn𝑘 + 𝛿n𝑘 2 (10) where 𝛿n𝑘 is the predicted specular normal offset for the 𝑘-th Gaussian primitive. Deferred shading for specular radiance transfer: As demonstrated in previous works [Dihlmann et al. 2024; Ye et al. 2024], deferred shading can also be applied to Gaussian splatting to improve the fidelity of the rendered specular appearance. We employ similar technique to our specular radiance transfer function. We use Eq. (2) to render specular normals, roughness, and specular visibility in screen space, denoted as n𝑢𝑣, 𝜎𝑢𝑣, and 𝑣𝑢𝑣, respectively. Take the specular normal for example: n𝑢𝑣 = 𝑘= n𝑘𝑜𝑘 (G𝑘, 𝑢, 𝑣) 𝑘 1 (cid:214) 𝑗=1 (1 𝑜 𝑗 (G𝑗 , 𝑢, 𝑣)) (11) Spherical Gaussians: We employ spherical Gaussians [Green et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2009] to model the specular appearance. Given screen space parameters n𝑢𝑣, 𝜎𝑢𝑣, and 𝑣𝑢𝑣 which we have described in the previous section, we compute the final specular color for the pixel (𝑢, 𝑣) in screen space as follows: 𝑠 (𝑢, 𝑣) = 𝑣𝑢𝑣 S2 L(𝜔𝑖 )𝐺𝑠 (𝜔𝑖 ; q𝑢𝑣, 𝜎𝑢𝑣)d𝜔𝑖 (12) where 𝐺𝑠 is the spherical Gaussian distribution of the specular lobe with mean q𝑢𝑣 S2 and standard deviation 𝜎𝑢𝑣 R+. Formally, the lobe is defined as: 𝐺𝑠 (p; q𝑢𝑣, 𝜎𝑢𝑣) = 1 2𝜋 2 3 𝜎𝑢𝑣 (cid:32) exp (cid:18) arccos(p q𝑢𝑣) 𝜎𝑢𝑣 1 2 (cid:19)2(cid:33) (13) in practice, the mean q𝑢𝑣 is the reflected vector of surface-to-camera direction around the surface normal: q𝑢𝑣 = 2(n𝑢𝑣 𝜔𝑜 )n𝑢𝑣 𝜔𝑜 , where 𝜔𝑜 is the surface-to-camera direction for pixel (𝑢, 𝑣). {𝑣𝑘 }𝑀 View-dependent appearance decoder: We decode specular parameters with view-dependent decoder D𝑐𝑣: 𝑘=1 = D𝑐𝑣 (l𝑏, l𝑓 , ˆ𝜔𝑜 ; Θ𝑐𝑣) (14) where ˆ𝜔𝑜 are canonicalized viewing directions in the local coordinate frames of the corresponding Gaussians. Similar to the albedo, roughness 𝜎𝑘 is defined explicitly on the UV texture map and optimized with gradient descents."

            "content": "Learning shadowing effects, especially for shadows caused by occlusion between body parts, is crucial for realistic avatar appearance. State-of-the-art methods rely on either mesh-based ray-tracing and denoising [Chen et al. 2024c], or tracing rays in radiance fields [Li et al. 2024b; Lin et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2024]. The former is limited by the reconstruction quality of semi-opaque surfaces and structures, such as skin, hairs, and thin clothes. The latter is limited by computational efficiency, as explicitly tracing rays in radiance fields is computationally expensive, and to estimate accurate shadowing effects, one needs to carry out ray tracing for each gradient update. Fortunately, our learned radiance transfer model already captures local shadows caused by intricate geometry such as cloth wrinkles. Here we describe the shadow branch that is dedicated to capturing non-local shadows caused by the occlusion between body parts. We start by precomputing normalized irradiance for the underlying coarse tracked mesh = {v𝑘 } as follows: Irradiance(v𝑘 ) = S2 L(v𝑘, 𝜔𝑖 )Vis(v𝑘, 𝜔𝑖 )d𝜔𝑖 S2 L(v𝑘, 𝜔𝑖 )d𝜔𝑖 (15) where Vis(v𝑘, 𝜔𝑖 ) is the visibility function that models whether the light from direction 𝜔𝑖 is visible at v𝑘 . We approximate Eq. (15) via Monte Carlo estimation in different scenarios such as multiple point lights (training) and environment maps (testing). Details can be found in Appendix A. We apply light-weight convolutional neural network [Bagautdinov et al. 2021] in UV space to predict shadow map value shadow𝑘 [0, 1], 𝑘 {1, , 𝑀 } given precomputed irradiance UV map. Similar to specular normal, roughness, and specular visibility, we render the shadow map in screen space as shadow(𝑢, 𝑣). The final output color for pixel (𝑢, 𝑣) is: C(𝑢, 𝑣) = (c 𝑑 (𝑢, 𝑣) + (16) where c𝑑 (𝑢, 𝑣) and c𝑠 (𝑢, 𝑣) are the diffuse and specular colors in screen space, respectively. 𝑠 (𝑢, 𝑣)) shadow(𝑢, 𝑣)"

This is because the PBR appearance model used in previous methods is designed mostly for opaque objects and does not model translucent structures such as hairs, and subsurface scattering effects for skins  (Fig. 3)  . Our method also achieves the best LPIPS scores compared to all ablation variants. Specifically, we show large performance drop when using SH instead of ZH, which demonstrates the importance of the ZH diffuse coefficients that capture appearance more faithfully for highly articulated body parts such as hands and arms  (Fig. 4)  . Here SH is not rotated as ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

Removing the shadow network also leads to noticeable decrease in all metrics, indicating that naive pose-dependent radiance transfer model is not sufficient to capture non-local shadow effects  (Fig. 5)  . Replacing Gaussian normals with mesh normals also results in less detailed normals  (Fig. 8)  , and slight drop in all metrics. We note that the w.o. deferred baseline achieves slightly better PSNR/SSIM compared to the full model. This could be attributed to two reasons: 1) w.o. deferred produces an overall smoother appearance due to alpha blending of multiple specular color predictions for single pixel; metrics such as PSNR/SSIM often favor this kind of smoothed appearance, while LPIPS reflects more on the overall perceptual quality of the rendering. This is demonstrated in Fig. 7 where w.o. deferred misses high-frequency reflections on the nose and eyes. 2) Our current geometry formulation for deferred shading is error-prone due to the noisy per-pixel depth estimation from Gaussian splatting. Misalignment in depth could result in errors in surface-to-light vectors, and subsequently propagating to shading results. The vanilla 3DGS is known for its under-representation of precise scene geometry. Several recent works try to improve the geometry reconstruction of 3DGS [Chen et al. 2024a; Huang et al. 2024; Yu et al. 2024]. Incorporating these improvements in our geometry representation would be an interesting future work."

            "title": "5 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "We have introduced novel method for full-body, relightable, and drivable human avatar reconstruction from light-stage data. Our experiments show that perceptually realistic relightable full-body avatars can be achieved by combining zonal-harmonic-based, orientation-dependent diffuse radiance transfer, and deferredshading-based specular radiance transfer, all learned from image observations only. We have also demonstrated that non-local shadows caused by body articulation can be captured by irradianceconditioned shadow networks. Overall, our approach achieves significant improvement in quality for full-body relightable human avatar modeling, compared to existing PBR-based models. Limitations: Our method has several limitations. First, the cloth dynamics are based purely on the learned latent space, which may ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: January 2025. not be physically plausible. In such case, the method may fail in out-of-distribution scenarios, e.g. when hands are touching the cloth or when extreme body poses are present. more physically plausible clothing layer [Peng et al. 2024; Rong et al. 2024; Xiang et al. 2022, 2023; Zheng et al. 2024] could be potentially integrated to resolve this issue. Second, our method is still suboptimal in capturing detailed appearances of eyes, faces, and hands compared to specialized methods [Chen et al. 2024b; Iwase et al. 2023; Li et al. 2022a; Saito et al. 2024], as the model capacity assigned to these regions is limited. This could be potentially solved by dynamically assigning UV space capacity to different body parts during learning. Lastly, our method has limited scalability as it requires multicamera setup with known light sources, natural future direction is to extend the method to universal setups similar to related face [Li et al. 2024a] and hand [Chen et al. 2024b] models."

On the other hand, the normalized irradiance maps are inputs to the neural network, which could potentially serve as denoiser. Indeed, we demonstrate in Table A.1 that even using 1 sample per pixel (1SPP) for approximating Eq. (A.1), the accuracy drop is minimal while the computational cost is significantly reduced."

            "title": "B LOSS DEFINITION",
            "content": "In this section, we extend Sec. 3.4 to include detailed definitions of the regularization losses used in our method. The regularization losses, as defined in Eq. (18), are as follows: Lreg =Lscale + 𝜆offsetLoffset + 𝜆maskLmask + 𝜆normalLnormal + 𝜆boundLbound + 𝜆normal_orientLnormal_orient + 𝜆alpha_sparsityLalpha_sparsity + 𝜆albedoLalbedo + 𝜆neg_colorLneg_color (B.1) where Lscale is the L1 loss on the scale of the Gaussians {s𝑘 }. Loffset is the L2 loss on the predicted delta translations {𝛿t𝑘 }. Lmask is the L1 mask loss between the rendered alpha maks from Gaussian primitives and the ground truth segmentation mask. Note that to keep fine-scale details such as hairs, we exclude boundary regions of the segmentation mask from the mask loss. Lnormal is the L2 loss on the predicted specular normal offsets {𝛿n𝑘 }. Lbound penalizes Gaussian scales and roughness values that go beyond predefined bounds. Specifically: Lbound = mean(𝑙bound), 𝑙bound = (cid:40) 1/max(𝑣, 107) (𝑣 𝑢𝑏) if if 𝑣 < 𝑙𝑏 𝑣 > 𝑢𝑏 (B.2) ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: January 2025. 14 Wang, S. et al where 𝑣 are either Gaussian scales for each rotation axis or roughness values. 𝑙𝑏 and 𝑢𝑏 are the lower and upper bounds, respectively. We set 𝑙𝑏 = 0.0001, 𝑢𝑏 = 0.01 for scales and 𝑙𝑏 = 0.01, 𝑢𝑏 = 0.25 for roughness. Lnormal_orient is the squared loss on the dot product between the deferred specular normals (Eq. (11)) and the view directions 𝜔𝑜 (𝑢, 𝑣): Lnormal_orient = mean (cid:16) max(0, ˆN(𝑢, 𝑣) 𝜔𝑜 )(𝑢, 𝑣) (cid:17) (B.3) Further, Lalpha_sparsity is the L1 loss on the alpha mask to encourage alpha values to be either 0 or 1. Note that we only apply this loss for non-hair regions, as hair regions are expected to have non-binary opacity values. Lalbedo is the L1 loss on the albedo values {𝜌𝑘 } to encourage realistic albedo values. Finally, Lalbedo and Lneg_color are the squared losses on negative diffuse color values and albedo values, respectively. These two loss terms penalize negative diffuse color values and albedo values, as negative values for these parameters are physically invalid. The weights for the regularization losses are set as follows: 𝜆offset is set to 0.05, 𝜆mask, 𝜆normal_orient, and 𝜆alpha_sparsity are set to 0.1, 𝜆bound, 𝜆albedo, and 𝜆neg_color are set to 0.01. 𝜆normal is linearly annealed from 1.0 to 0 over the first 20k training steps. The final loss is defined as: = Lrec + Lreg ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: January 2025."
