            "content": "Recently, \"slow-thinking\" reasoning has emerged as significant advancement in large language models (LLM) domain (Shao et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2025b; Chen et al., 2025b), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks (Chen et al., 2025c; Xu et al., 2025), such as OpenAI-o1 (Jaech et al., 2024) and DeepSeekR1 (Guo et al., 2025a). The superior performance * Corresponding Author 1The related codes are released in this URL: https://github.com/jian0805/ReflectionV Figure 1: Existing slow-thinking VLMs claimed aha moment is often merely textual reflection. We instead highlight visual reflection, where VLM actively verifies and refines its reasoning based on visual inputs. of \"slow thinking\" LLM primarily benefits from its ability to perform \"reflection\" during reasoning (Yan et al., 2024). This reflection mechanism allows models to check and revise intermediate steps before generating the final answer, thereby avoiding errors that may arise from short-cut inference (Snell et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025b; Cheng et al., 2024), which is also called aha moment. Inspired by this success, some researchers attempt to integrate \"slow thinking\" into vision-language models (VLMs), enabling the trained visual reasoning models (VRMs) to generate more accurate and deliberate solutions (Wang et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a; Tan et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025). Specifically, they leverage \"slow thinking\" LLMs to reason based on image descriptions generated by VLMs, thereby introducing reflection patterns into reasoning data. These visual reasoning data are often used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Thawakar et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2024a), providing cold-start initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) (Huang et al., 2025; Tan et al., 2025). In this paper, we propose that the true aha moment in visual reasoning arises when model engages in visual reflectionthat is, when it actively verifies and refines its reasoning based on the visual input, as shown in Figure 1. However, current distillation-based approaches to training VRMs often miss this crucial aspect. By transferring superficial reflective behaviors from LLMs trained solely on text, these methods encourage reasoning patterns that are detached from the visual modality. This is because the cold-start data for these VRMs still originates from text-only reasoning on visual descriptions, and the RL stage uses rewards based solely on textual outputs (Huang et al., 2025; Meng et al., 2025). Thus, instead of promoting visual insight, these VRMs risk reinforcing textual hallucinations and visual neglect (Zhong et al., 2024; Favero et al., 2024). As result, VRMs may appear reflective while actually bypassing the visual content, undermining both the reliability and robustness of their reasoning. Consistent with the previous discussion, we conducted detailed analysis of existing VRMs and found that they struggle with visual reflection. Specifically, experiments observe that existing VRMs attention to and reliance on visual information decline rapidly as the number of generated tokens increases. And VRMs trained by distilling text-only reflection data even exhibit lower reliance on visual prompts than their backbone VLMs. This indicates that existing VRMs struggle to attend to and leverage visual information during reflection, thereby degrading into text-only reflection models. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose novel two-stage training strategy for training VRMs. In the cold-start stage, we focus on resolving the limitations of image descriptionbased approaches in incorporating visual reflection patterns within training data. Specifically, we leverage multi-modal agent, where LLMs interact with VLMs, to complete reasoning in an LLM-VLM interleaved way. This data construction paradigm ensures that visual information can be continuously accessed and repeatedly utilized during reasoning, thereby introducing visual reflection pattern for VRMs to learn. In the RL stage, to further promote the visual reflection behavior learned from coldstart data, we introduce visual attention based reward for group relative policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024). This reward encourages VRMs to consistently attend to visual information. Reflection-V, our VRM trained with the proposed strategy, achieves significant improvements on benchmarks focusing on mathematical (Lu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024), multi-disciplinary (Yue et al., 2024a,b), and general reasoning (Chen et al., 2024a). At the 7B scale, it is comparable to or even surpasses several widely used very large VLMs, like GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) and InternVL2.538B (Chen et al., 2024b). Notably, the aforementioned quantitative analyses and case study further show that compared to the base model, ReflectionV maintains more sustained attention to visual information and actively engages in visual reflection, representing the emergence of the true \"aha moment\" in visual reasoning."

This limitation hampers their ability to perform visual reflection and prevents them from fully benefiting from \"slow thinking\" paradigms like DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025a). To address this problem, we propose two-stage strategy for training VRMs. This strategy consists of: (1) cold-start initialization (Yang et al., 2025c) on reasoning data with visual reflection, and (2) reinforcement learning with visual attention-based reward. In the first stage, we leverage multimodal agent, where LLMs interact with VLMs, to construct visual reasoning data exhibiting visual reflection, and use it to perform supervised finetuning (SFT) on the base VLM. The second stage applies GRPO with the proposed reward function that explicitly encourages sustained attention to visual tokens.

Inspired by recent advances in visual-language agents (Zhou et al., 2024; Jian et al., 2024), we employ crafted prompts to guide the interaction between the LLM and VLM in completing the reasoning task. This data construction paradigm ensures that visual information is continuously accessible and repeatedly utilized during reasoning, thereby introducing visual reflection pattern.

This analysis reveals that VRMs typically lack visual reflection ability in long-chain reasoning, as Figure 3: workflow for constructing reasoning data with visual reflection pattern. LLMs and VLMs perform reasoning through interaction, ensuring that visual information is continuously acquired and repeatedly utilized, thereby creating visual reflection pattern in the reasoning process. process is detailed in the following sections. Visual Reflection Data Construction Based on LLM-VLM Interaction. As shown in Figure 3, in our data construction process, the LLM and VLM interact by taking on the following three roles: 1) Visual requester, played by the LLM, which determines what visual information is needed to answer the question based on the existing reasoning context and proposes request to the VLM. During this process, the CoT output from the VLM is added as partial solution to the reasoning context. 2) Visual responder, played by the VLM, replies to the request made by the visual requester, revealing visual information related to the visual question. The visual description generated by the visual responder is added to the reasoning context. 3) Summarizer, played by the LLM, summarizes the existing reasoning context after each round of interaction, generating the final answer. If the generated answer does not match the ground truth, all outputs from the summarizer are discarded, and new round of interaction begins. Otherwise, the output is added to the reasoning context, completing the reasoning process for the visual question. Post-generation processing. After constructing visual reflection data through LLM and VLM interactions, we perform the following steps to ensure data quality: 1) Non-Reflection Filtering. We filter out the data where the summarizer produces the correct answer just after the first interaction. These samples lack sustained reliance on visual information, and the reasoning solution does not exhibit visual reflection pattern. 2) Cohesion Enhancement. In the previous data construction process, the text generated across different VLMLLM interaction rounds may lack coherence. We employ the LLM to process and refine the text into cohesive reasoning process. All detailed prompts are provided in Appendix B."

Specifically, based on the analyses in Section 2.1 that attention weights on visual tokens rapidly decrease as the number of generated tokens increases, our reward rule follows the principle: For VRM reasoning process, VRMs receive higher reward if relatively higher attention to visual tokens is maintained after generating several tokens. Therefore, the visual attention based reward is given by rv = (cid:80) Attn(n,Tvis) n>Tres/2 (cid:80) Attn(n,Tvis) n<Tres/2 0 if ra = 1 if ra = 0 .

Our method is evaluated using the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model. During the cold-start stage, we train for 3 epochs on 2 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. The model, after cold-start initialization, is subsequently trained using GRPO with visual attention based reward for 12 epochs on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, based on the Verl training framework (Sheng et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2025).

The results indicate that our model significantly outperforms Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) base model and other open-source models of similar scale in reasoning capability. Even compared to existing vision-language reasoning models based on RL, Reflection-V-7B achieves notable margin of improvement. Notably, Reflection-V-7B reaches comparable or even superior performance compared to some widely used, large-scale closed-source and opensource VLMs. For instance, on MathVision and MathVista, Reflection-V-7B outperforms GPT-4o and InternVL-2.5-38B (Chen et al., 2024b). On MMMU and M3CoT, Reflection-V-7B surpasses InternVL-2.5-38B and LLaVA-OneVision-72B (Li et al., 2024a), and is comparable to GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024). On MMMU-Pro, Reflection-V-7B outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B and GPT-4V (Yang et al., 2023), while being comparable to InternVL-2.5-38B. In contrast to existing visionlanguage reasoning models, which show improved math reasoning but decline in multi-disciplinary and general reasoning capabilities, Reflection-V demonstrates improvements across all three categories. Additionally, experimental results show that the proposed method is effective across models of different scales. Surprisingly, thanks to \"visual reflection\" we proposed, Reflection-V exhibits significantly fewer visual hallucinations. Specifically, we use HallBench (Guan et al., 2024) to quantify the extent of visual hallucinations in VLMs or VRMs. Compared to the Qwen2.5-VL base model, Reflection-V shows significantly higher all accuracy (aAcc) (Guan et al., 2024) on HallBench. This result suggests that, due to sustained focus on visual information, the visual hallucinations commonly observed in VRMs are notably suppressed. In contrast, other VRMs experience even more severe visual hallucinations than the base model. This can be attributed to the fact that, as mentioned earlier, VRMs struggle to maintain sustained attention to visual information as more textual tokens are generated during reasoning."

Notably, coldstart yields particularly substantial performance gain. This indicates that emphasizing the continuous reliance and repeated utilization of visual information in SFT data significantly improves visual reasoning performance. Furthermore, with coldstart, the performance improvement from visual attention based reward becomes more pronounced. We believe this occurs because cold-start, based on visual reflection data, guides VRMs in how to increase their attention to visual information. We conduct further ablation to validate the superiority of emphasizing visual reflection pattern in cold-start data. Specifically, we replace the reasoning data containing visual reflection patterns with image caption-based reasoning data (derived from the same origin data) during cold-start initialization, then compare their performance across benchmarks. As shown in Table 3, our method outperforms the \"caption then reasoning\" data construction paradigm by significant margin. This result also illustrates that the improved visual reasoning performance originates not from distilling high-quality data from larger models but rather from the intentional incorporation of visual reflection patterns in constructed data. Besides, We conducted additional experiments to analyze whether the proposed cold-start data construction method exhibits any bias toward specific model families. Specifically, we replaced the VLM and LLM used for constructing cold-start data with InternVL3-38B (Zhu et al., 2025) and Qwen3-32B (Thinking mode) (Yang et al., 2025a), and compared the results with those from constructing coldstart data using Qwen2.5VL-72B and QWQ-32B. The results are shown in Table 4. The experimental findings indicate that the performance gap between InternVL3/Qwen3 and Qwen2.5-VL/QWQ in constructing cold-start data is minimal. This suggests that our cold-start data construction method does not exhibit any bias toward specific model families. To further validate that the proposed method improves performance by achieving the claimed visual reflection, we present further analyses below. Figure 5: Our model, Reflection-V, exhibits the visual reflection capacity that we claim, in contrast to other RL-based visual reasoning models. The background color of tokens in the figure indicates the magnitude of the visual attention weight. This visual reflection capacity is demonstrated by the recheck and attention to visual tokens again that appear alongside \"Aha moment\", like \"Lets check the image again\"."

We find that, in the middle and deep transformer layers, Reflection-V exhibits significantly higher attention weights to visual tokens than OpenVLThinker, the model also trained through SFT cold-start initialization and GRPO, based on Qwen2.5-VL, as shown in Figure 4. As the number of generated tokens increases, the decrease in attention weight to visual tokens is slower in Reflection-V-7B than in OpenVLThinker-7B. Furthermore, to investigate whether the proposed method enhances VRMs reliance on visual information, we compare the visual dependency measure, as referred to in equation (3), of Reflection-V and OpenVLThinker at different generated tokens, as shown in Figure 4. The results indicate that, benefiting from the emphasis on visual reflection, Reflection-V significantly mitigates the diminishing of dependence on visual information as generated tokens increase, compared to OpenVLThinker. To sum up, Reflection-V exhibits more sustained reliance on visual information. Experimental results also show that this feaBetter performance, sustained visual attention, and reliance all originate from visual reflection. As discussed earlier, the proposed method improves visual reasoning performance while maintaining visual attention and dependency during reasoning. Figure 5 presents comprehensive example demonstrating that these gains are indeed due to the models visual reflection ability. In this example, Reflection-V actively verifies and refines its reasoning by rechecking the visual input. When textual Aha moments like Lets check the image again appear, the visual attention weight rises sharply during next-token prediction, representing the true aha moment in visual reasoning. As Figure 5 shows, visual reflection capacity enables Reflection-V to reveal critical visual information absent from the reasoning context, thereby inferring the correct answer. Additionally, Figure 4 shows that the upper bound of the confidence interval for visual dependency measure shows virtually no decline with increasing generated tokens. This suggests that during reasoning, as the number of generated tokens increases, Reflection-V maintains consistent dependency on visual tokens throughout the generation process. The observed decline in average visual dependency measure stems from the reduced frequency of visual reflection as the number of generated tokens increases. This phenomenon aligns with the re-emergent, image-focused attention derived from visual reflection, which is observed in Figure 4. These results demonstrate that, when Reflection-V engages in visual reflection, it maintains the same level of focus and reliance on visual tokens as at the start of reasoning."

            "content": "Visual Reasoning model. Large VLMs typically project inputs from non-text modalities into textual representations that LLMs can process (Guan et al., 2025; Ye and Wang, 2025; Guo et al., 2025b; Jing and Zhao, 2024; Zhang et al., 2025e), achieving strong performance in vision understanding (Bai et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024b; Jian et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025b). The advancement of LLMs has redefined state-of-the-art performance across vast landscape of tasks (Zhang et al., 2025d,c; Ren et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2024b). Motivated by recent advances in LLM domain (Chen et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2025d), researchers enhance Large VLMs reasoning with step-level reasoning SFT datasets (Xu et al., 2024a; Jian et al., 2025) and RL (Yang et al., 2025c). However, as discussed earlier, these trained VRMs typically struggle with visual reflection, leading VRMs to reason without visual grounding after many tokens are generated. Visual forgetting alleviation. Consistent with visual reflection that we claim, some recent studies emphasize alleviating forgetting visual cues during long-chain inference. M3ID (Favero et al., 2024) employs mutual information decoding to amplify image influence while weakening linguistic priors, thereby promoting continuous reliance on visual cues. But diminishing linguistic priors lowers performance on complex reasoning tasks (Bitton Guetta et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a). TVC (Sun et al., 2025a), concurrent work, periodically replays visual tokens during inference to reuse visual cues, but it cannot flexibly invoke visual reflection when required. Distinct from these works, we embed visual reflection capability into VRMs based on data generated by LLM-VLM interaction, and reinforce this capability during RL. As result, the trained VRMs can actively refine their reasoning based on the visual input when needed."

            "content": "In this paper, we propose that the true aha moment in visual reasoning arises when model engages in visual reflectionthat is, when it actively verifies and refines its reasoning based on the visual input. Through quantitative studies, we reveal that existing VRMs struggle with such visual reflection. Therefore, to address this critical challenge, we propose two-stage training strategy combining LLM-VLM interaction-driven reflective reasoning patterns with visual attention based RL. This training strategy significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks. Experiments confirm that such improvement is derived from sustained visual attention and reliance, demonstrating the effectiveness of visual reflection. This work establishes foundation for integrating visual reflection into VRMs, narrowing the gap between visual and text-only reasoning on complex tasks."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Firstly, due to computational constraints, we could not conduct experiments like GRPO with models larger than 7B parameters. Thus, we limited our exploration to the 3B and 7B parameter scales. Secondly, our cold-start initialization (based on constructed reasoning data with visual reflection pattern), reinforcement learning (with visual attention based reward), and evaluation presently involve relatively limited categories of visual-language datasets. In future work, we plan to include wider range of visual-language datasets covering diverse problem types to further evaluate the generalization ability of the proposed method."

Beyond the MMMU results reported in the main text, Figures 6 and 7 evaluate Reflection-V-7B on three additional visual-reasoning benchmarks spanning mathematical, multi-disciplinary, and general domains. Figure 6 traces last-layer attention from response tokens to visual tokens over 500 generated tokens: Reflection-V-7B consistently launches with higher visual-attention strength than Qwen2.5VL7B andcruciallydecays far more slowly, retaining about 30%40% of its initial level where baselines sink below 10%. This advantage extends to other VRMs such as OpenVLThinker-7B, whose Figure 6: Attention weights (last layer) on visual tokens of Reflection-V-7B on multiple benchmarks, compared to OpenVLThinker-7B and Qwen2.5VL-7B. The shown attention weights represent the mean value across all samples. Figure 7: Visual dependency measur of Reflection-V-7B on multiple benchmarks, compared to OpenVLThinker-7B and Qwen2.5VL-7B. Visual dependency measure quantifies the difference in probability distributions for next token prediction based on generated tokens, before and after discarding visual tokens."

            "content": "cold-start and RL stages, as noted earlier, further erode visual attention and dependency; ReflectionV therefore surpasses these models as well. Figure 7 reports the Visual Dependency Measure (VDM): the upper bound of Reflection-Vs confidence interval remains nearly flat across all tasks, indicating sustained reliance on visual evidence, while the baselines exhibit pronounced downward trend. These supplementary findings demonstrate that Reflection-V maintains robust visual attention and dependency across diverse reasoning scenarios, substantiating its superior visual-reflection capability. Scaling experiment of the proposed method. We further conduct scaling experiment on the MS-SWIFT framework, leveraging LoRA as an efficient training technique on InternVL3-14B. The number of GRPO training epochs is also set to 12. The evaluation results on several visual reasoning benchmarks are shown in Table A. These results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms GRPO, which solely relies on textual outputbased reward. This experiment demonstrates that our approach can effectively scale to larger models and enhance their visual reasoning capabilities."
