            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "In recent years, the field of Digital Pathology (DP) has experienced rapid advancement driven largely by progress in artificial intelligence, particularly with the emergence of Foundation Models. These large-scale models, trained on extensive datasets comprising billions of images, have established robust feature extraction capabilities that significantly boost performance on downstream tasks such as classification, segmentation, and diagnostic prediction. However, the effectiveness and generalizability of these AI models are fundamentally limited by the quantity, diversity, and accessibility of the datasets used during training. Despite the critical role that Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play in computational pathology, publicly available datasets remain scarce compared to other computer vision domains. The majority of existing WSI datasets, while instrumental in setting benchmarks and facilitating supervised learning, are often limited in scale, diversity of tissue types, staining methods, and clinical annotations. Additionally, these datasets typically focus narrowly on specific diagnostic tasks or cancer types, thereby constraining their broader applicability and limiting model robustness [1]. To accelerate progress and address these limitations, there is clear need for openly accessible, large-scale, and multimodal datasets in Digital Pathology. Such datasets would enable researchers and developers to explore more generalizable, robust, and clinically relevant AI models capable of real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce and open-source the HISTAI-dataset, substantial WSI dataset designed to bridge the existing gaps by providing diverse collection of cases accompanied by comprehensive clinical metadata. Each case in our dataset includes Whole Slide Images along with metadata containing diagnostic information (including diagnosis and ICD-10 codes), patient demographics (such as age and gender), detailed pathological conclusions, differential diagnostic considerations, as well as macro and micro protocol descriptions. By releasing this dataset to the community, we aim to foster innovation, promote reproducibility, and ultimately drive the DP industry forward towards more accurate and generalized AI solutions. dmitry@hist.ai alex@hist.ai kate@hist.ai HISTAI: AN OPEN-SOURCE, LARGE-SCALE WSI DATASET"

            "content": "A number of public whole-slide image (WSI) datasets have been published throughout the years in digital pathology, particularly for supervised learning and benchmarking. Below, we review the most notable slide-level resources, each with its own motivation, design constraints, and domain focus. TCGA [2]: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was landmark initiative by the NIH and NCI to map genomic alterations across cancer types. As part of this effort, approximately 33,500 H&E-stained diagnostic WSIs from 11,000 patients were digitized across 33 tumor types. These slides, while primarily included for diagnostic documentation, became de facto standard for deep learning in pathology due to their breadth and linkage with transcriptomic, genomic, and survival data. CAMELYON16 [3]: Developed as part of the CAMELYON16 challenge at ISBI 2016, this dataset includes 400 WSIs of breast cancer sentinel lymph nodes collected at two Dutch institutions. Its purpose was to benchmark algorithms for detecting metastases in lymph node tissue. Notably, 129 slides have pixel-wise annotations outlining tumor metastases, enabling precise evaluation of detection performance. CAMELYON17 [4]: follow-up to CAMELYON16, this dataset was built for the CAMELYON17 challenge at MICCAI 2017 to promote robust, patient-level prediction. It contains 1,000 H&E WSIs from 200 patients across five centers, each with slide-level and patient-level metastasis labels (e.g., isolated tumor cells, microor macro-metastases). Fifty slides are annotated with detailed tumor segmentation masks, while the full set supports evaluation of algorithms under inter-center variability and domain shift. TUPAC16 [5]: Released during the TUPAC16 challenge at MICCAI 2016, this dataset addressed automated assessment of tumor proliferation in breast cancer. It includes 500 WSIs from TCGA-BRCA, each labeled with tumor proliferation score derived from mitotic activity and mRNA expression. Unlike CAMELYON, the goal here was slide-level regression/classification rather than segmentation. separate mitosis detection task was based on ROI patches, making TUPAC one of the first datasets to link WSI-level outcomes to molecular biomarkers. PANDA [6]: The PANDA dataset was released as part of Kaggle competition in 2020, motivated by the clinical demand for scalable Gleason grading in prostate biopsies. It comprises 10,616 H&E-stained needle core biopsy slides from Radboud UMC and Karolinska Institute. Each slide is labeled with Gleason grade group (05), enabling direct supervised learning. PANDA is notable for its unprecedented size, cross-center diversity, and real-world diagnostic setting, making it dominant benchmark in prostate pathology. ACROBAT [7]: Designed for the ACROBAT challenge at MICCAI 2022, this dataset tackles the problem of registering H&E and IHC slides. It includes 4,212 WSIs from 1,153 breast cancer patients, with up to five stainings per patient: H&E, ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67. Each slide pair is aligned via 37,208 manually annotated landmark correspondences. ACROBAT is one of the few resources enabling multimodal registration, key task for combining morphological and molecular information. While these datasets have been foundational, key gaps remain. Many organs and cancer types are underrepresented, IHC and other non-H&E stains are rarely available at scale, and few datasets provide multimodal annotations suited for generalization studies. Our proposed dataset aims to address several of these limitations by releasing HISTAI-dataset."

            "title": "3 Dataset Description",
            "content": "The HISTAI dataset is comprehensive, open-source resource for computational pathology research, designed to address the limitations identified in existing public datasets. The dataset provides extensive Whole Slide Images (WSIs) accompanied by detailed clinical and pathological metadata, enabling diverse applications ranging from diagnostic modeling to multimodal analyses. The HISTAI dataset serves as foundational resource within the broader research ecosystem. Notably, the SPIDER dataset [8], collection of patch-level annotated pathological datasets, utilizes slides from the HISTAI dataset. Additionally, the Hibou foundation models [9], have been trained on larger, encompassing dataset, of which HISTAI forms subset. 3.1 Structure and Organization The dataset is organized into specialized subsets based on tissue types and pathology specializations. These subsets are independently accessible on the Hugging Face platform, allowing researchers targeted access to relevant cases. The general naming structure for slides within each case is as follows: 2 HISTAI: AN OPEN-SOURCE, LARGE-SCALE WSI DATASET <dataset_name>/case_<case_id>/slide_<stain>_<slide_number>.tiff <dataset_name>/case_<case_id>/slide_<magnification>_<stain>_<slide_number>.tiff Most slides are digitized at standard magnification of 20X using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. Slides captured at alternative magnifications (primarily 40X) explicitly note the magnification in their filenames, ensuring clarity for downstream tasks. The majority of the slides were digitized using Leica Aperio GT450 and AT2 scanners, though some were scanned with Hamamatsu or 3DHISTECH systems. However we cant determine the exact model of the scanner for individual slides. 3.2 Metadata master metadata repository accompanies the image subsets, providing extensive clinical, pathological, and technical annotations for each case. The metadata includes: Diagnosis: Clinical diagnostic information and notes. Conclusion: Detailed pathological conclusions. Differential Diagnosis: Alternative diagnostic considerations. Micro Protocol: Detailed microscopic examination descriptions. Additional Information: Supplementary clinical or pathological details. Patient Demographics: Age and gender of the patient. ICD-10 Codes: Standardized diagnostic codes. Gross Examination Details: Descriptions from macroscopic analysis. Each metadata entry directly references the corresponding WSIs, ensuring seamless integration of clinical and imagebased data. 3.3 Available Specialized Datasets Currently, HISTAI comprises the following specialized subsets: HISTAI-hematologic HISTAI-gastrointestinal HISTAI-breast HISTAI-thorax HISTAI-skin-b1 HISTAI-skin-b2 HISTAI-colorectal-b1 HISTAI-colorectal-b 3.4 Dataset Statistics The HISTAI dataset currently contains substantial number of WSIs and cases, summarized in Table 1.
