Generative\nRetrieval (GR) [41] method formulates the problem of retrieving\nrelevant documents from the database as a sequence generation\ntask which generate the relevant document tokens sequentially.\nThe document tokens can be the document titles, document IDs\nor pre-trained semantic IDs [42]. GENRE [8] first adopts the trans-\nformer architecture for entity retrieval, generating entity names in\nan autoregressive fashion based on the conditioned context. DSI\n[42] first proposes the concept of assigning structured semantic\nIDs to documents and training encoder-decoder models for gen-\nerative document retrieval. Following this paradigm, TIGER [36]\nintroduces the formulation of generative item retrieval models for\nrecommender systems.",

Recent research focuses on the semantic indexing technique [12, 36, 42], which aims to index items based on content information. Specifically, TIGER [36] and LC-Rec [51] apply residual quantization (RQ-VAE) to textual embeddings derived from item titles and descriptions for tokenization. Recforest [12] utilizes hierarchical k-means clustering on item textual embeddings to obtain cluster indexes as tokens. Furthermore, recent studies such as EAGER [45] explore integrating both semantic and collaborative information into the tokenization process."

            "content": "Figure 1: (a) Our proposed unified architecture for end-toend generation. (b) typical cascade ranking system, which includes three stages from the bottom to the top: Retrieval, Pre-ranking, and Ranking. Although efficient in practice, existing methods typically treat each ranker independently, where the effectiveness of each isolated stage serves as the upper bound for the subsequent ranking stage, thereby limiting the performance of the overall ranking system. Despite various efforts [11, 13, 18, 20, 34, 44] to improve overall recommendation performance by enabling interaction among rankers, they still maintain the traditional cascade ranking paradigm. Recently, generative retrieval-based recommendation systems (GRs) [36, 45, 51] have emerged as promising paradigm by directly generating the identifier of candidate item in an autoregressive sequence generation manner. By indexing items with quantized semantic IDs that encode item semantics [24], recommenders can leverage the abundant semantic information within the items. The generative nature of GRs makes them suitable for directly selecting candidate items through beam search decoding and producing more diverse recommendation results. However, current generative models only act as selectors in the retrieval stage, as their recommendation accuracy does not yet match that of well-designed multiple cascade rankers. To address the above challenges, we propose unified end-toend generative framework for single-stage recommendation named OneRec. First, we present an encoder-decoder architecture. Taking inspiration from the scaling laws observed in training large language models, we find that scaling the capacity of recommendation models also consistently improves the performance. So we scale up the model parameters based on the structure of MoE [7, 9, 55], which significantly improves the models ability to characterize user interests. Second, unlike the traditional point-by-point prediction of the next item, we propose session-wise list generation approach that considers the relative content and order of the items within each session. The point-by-point generation method necessitates hand-craft strategies to ensure coherence and diversity in the generated results. In contrast, the session-wise learning process enables the model to autonomously learn the optimal session structure by feeding it preferred data. Last but not least, we explore preference learning by using direct preference optimization (DPO) [35] to further enhance the quality of the generated results. For constructing preference pairs, we take inspiration from hard negative sampling [37] by creating self-hard rejected samples from the beam search results rather than random sampling. We propose an Iterative Preference Alignment (IPA) strategy to rank the sampled responses based on scores provided by the pre-trained reward model (RM), identifying the best-chosen and worst-rejected samples. Our experiments on large-scale industry datasets show the superiority of the OneRec: Unifying Retrieve and Rank with Generative Recommender and Preference Alignment Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Figure 2: The overall framework of OneRec, consists of two stages: (i) the session training stage which train OneRec with session-wise data; (ii) the IPA stage which utilizes iterative direct preference optimization with self-hard negatives. instability and inefficiency. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [35] is proposed which derives the optimal policy in closed form and enables direct optimization using preference data. Apart from that, several variants have been proposed to further improve the original DPO. For example, IPO [1] bypasses two approximations in DPO with general objective. cDPO [35] alleviates the influence of noisy labels by introducing hyperparameter 𝜖. rDPO [5] designs an unbiased estimate of the original Binary Cross Entropy loss. Other variants including CPO [47], simDPO [5], also enhance or expand DPO in various aspects. However, unlike traditional NLP scenarios where preference data is explicitly annotated through humans, preference learning in recommendation systems faces unique challenge because of the sparsity of user-item interaction data. This challenge results in adapting DPO for recommendation are still largely unexplored. Different from S-DPO which focuses on incorporating multiple negatives in user preference data for LM-based recommenders, we train reward model and based on the scores from reward model we choose personalized preference data for different users."

However, such method is suboptimal due to the unbalanced code distribution which is known as the hourglass phenomenon [23].

Specifically, the encoder leverages the stacked multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers to process the input sequence H𝑢 . We denote the encoded historical interaction features as = 𝐸𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟 (H𝑢 ). The decoder takes the semantic IDs of the target session as input and generates the target in an auto-regressive manner. To train larger model at reasonable economic costs, for the feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) in the decoder, we adopt the MoE architecture [7, 9, 55] commonly used in Transformer-based language models and substitute the 𝑙-th FFN with: (cid:16) 𝑔𝑖,𝑡 FFN𝑖 (cid:16) 𝑙 𝑡 (cid:17)(cid:17) 𝑙 𝑡 , + 𝑙+1 𝑡 = 𝑔𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑁MoE 𝑖=1 (cid:40)𝑠𝑖,𝑡 , 0, 𝑠𝑖,𝑡 Topk({𝑠 𝑗,𝑡 1 𝑗 𝑁 }, 𝐾MoE), otherwise, (cid:17) 𝑇 (cid:16) (2) 𝑠𝑖,𝑡 = Softmax𝑖 𝑙 𝑡 𝑙 𝑖 , where 𝑁MoE represents the total number of experts, FFN𝑖 () is the 𝑖th expert FFN, and 𝑔𝑖,𝑡 denotes the gate value for the 𝑖-th expert. The gate value 𝑔𝑖,𝑡 is sparse, meaning that only 𝐾MoE out of 𝑁MoE gate values are non-zero. This sparsity property ensures computational efficiency within an MoE layer and each token will be assigned to and computed in only 𝐾MoE experts.

Here, the output 𝑟 represents the reward corresponding to user 𝑢s (usually represented by user behavior) preference on the session = {𝒗1, 𝒗2, . . . , 𝒗𝑚 }. In order to equip the RM with the capacity to rank session, we first extract the target-aware representation 𝒆𝑖 = 𝒗𝑖 𝒖 of each item 𝒗𝑖 in S, where represents the target-aware operation (such as target attention toward user behavior). So we get the target-aware representation 𝒉 = {𝒆1, 𝒆2, , 𝒆𝑚 } for session S. Then the items within session interact with each other through self-attention layers to fuse the necessary information among different items: 𝒉𝑓 = SelfAttention(𝒉𝑾 𝑄 𝑠 , 𝒉 𝑾 𝐾 𝑠 , 𝒉𝑾 𝑉 𝑠 ) (5) Next we utilize different tower to make predictions on multitarget reward and the RM is pre-trained with abundant recommendation data: where ˆ𝑟 𝑠𝑤𝑡 = Tower𝑠𝑤𝑡 (cid:0)Sum(cid:0)𝒉𝑓 (cid:1)(cid:1), ˆ𝑟 𝑣𝑡𝑟 = Tower𝑣𝑡𝑟 (cid:0)Sum(cid:0)𝒉𝑓 (cid:1)(cid:1), ˆ𝑟 𝑤𝑡𝑟 = Tower𝑤𝑡𝑟 (cid:0)Sum(cid:0)𝒉𝑓 (cid:1)(cid:1), ˆ𝑟 𝑙𝑡𝑟 = Tower𝑙𝑡𝑟 (cid:0)Sum(cid:0)𝒉𝑓 (cid:1)(cid:1), Tower() = Sigmoid(cid:0)MLP() (cid:1) After getting all the estimated rewards ˆ𝑟𝑠𝑤𝑡 , . . . and the groundtruth labels 𝑦𝑠𝑤𝑡 , . . . for each session, we directly minimize the binary cross-entropy loss to train the RM.

Given the preference pairs, we can now train new model 𝑀𝑡 +1 which is initialized from model 𝑀𝑡 , and updated with loss function that combines the DPO loss [35] for learning from the preference pairs. The loss corresponding to each preference pair is as follows: LDPO = LDPO (S𝑤 (cid:32) 𝑢 , S𝑙 (cid:33) = log 𝜎 𝛽 log 𝑢 H𝑢 ) 𝑀𝑡 +1 (S𝑤 𝑀𝑡 (S𝑤 𝑢 H𝑢 ) 𝑢 H𝑢 ) 𝛽 log 𝑀𝑡 +1 (S𝑙 𝑀𝑡 (S𝑙 𝑢 H𝑢 ) 𝑢 H𝑢 ) .

For each successive model 𝑀𝑡 +1, it initializes from previous model 𝑀𝑡 and utilizes the preference data 𝐷pairs generated by the 𝑀𝑡 for training. 𝑡 Figure 3: Framework of Online Deployment of OneRec.

            "content": "5.1.2 Baseline Methods. We adopt the following representative recommendation models, DPO and its variants to serve as additional baselines for comparison. The baseline methods include: SASRec [22] employs unidirectional Transformer architecture to capture sequential dependencies in user-item interactions for next-item prediction. BERT4Rec [40] leverages bidirectional Transformers with masked language modeling to learn contextual item representations through sequence reconstruction. FDSA [50] implements dual self-attention pathways to jointly model item-level transitions and feature-level transformation patterns in heterogeneous recommendation scenarios. TIGER [36] leverages hierarchical semantic identifiers and generative retrieval techniques for sequential recommendation through auto-regressive sequence generation. OneRec: Unifying Retrieve and Rank with Generative Recommender and Preference Alignment Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY DPO [35] formalizes preference optimization with closed-form reward function derived from human feedback data via implicit reward modeling. IPO [1] proposes theoretically grounded preference optimization framework which bypass the approximations inherent in standard DPO. cDPO [30] introduces robustness-aware variant incorporating label flipping rate parameter 𝜖 to account for noisy preference annotations. rDPO [5] develops an unbiased loss estimator using importance sampling to reduce variance in preference optimization. CPO [47] unifies contrastive learning with preference optimization through joint training of sequence likelihood rewards and supervised fine-tuning objectives. simPO [29] conducts preference optimization by employing sequence-level reward margins while eliminating reference model dependencies through normalized probability averaging. S-DPO [4] adapts DPO for recommendation systems through hard negative sampling and multi-item contrastive learning to enhance ranking accuracy. 5.1.3 Evaluation Metric. We evaluate the models performance with several key metrics. Each metric serves distinct purpose in assessing different aspects of the models output and we conduct the evaluation on randomly sampled set of test cases in each iteration. To estimate the probabilities of various interactions for each specific user-session pair, we employ the pre-trained reward model to assess the value of recommended sessions. We calculate the mean reward for different target metrics, including session watch time (swt), view probability (vtr), follow probability (wtr) and like probability (ltr). Among these targets, swt and vtr are watching-time metrics, while wtr and ltr are interaction metrics. Figure 4: The ablation study on DPO sample ratio 𝑟DPO. The results indicate that 1% ratio of DPO training leads to significant gains but further increase the sample ratio results in limited improvements."

            "content": "First, the proposed session-wise generation approach significantly outperforms traditional dot-product-based methods and point-wise generation methods like TIGER. OneRec1B achieves 1.78% higher maximum swt and 3.36% higher maximum ltr compared to TIGER-1B. This demonstrates the advantage of session-wise modeling in maintaining contextual coherence across recommendations, whereas point-wise methods struggle to balance coherence and diversity in generated outputs. Second, small ratio of DPO training yields substantial gains. With only 1% DPO training ratio (𝑟DPO), OneRec-1B+IPA surpasses the base OneRec-1B by 4.04% in maximum swt and 5.43% in maximum ltr. This suggests limited DPO training can effectively aligns the model with desired generation patterns. Third, the proposed IPA strategy outperforms various existing DPO variants. As shown in Table 1, IPA achieves superior performance compared to alternative DPO implementations. Notably, some DPO baselines underperform even the non-aligned OneRec-1B model, suggesting that iterative mining of self-generated outputs for preference selection proves more effective than other methods."

Our solution estab-\nlishes three key contributions: First, we effectively scale the model\nparameters with high computational efficiency by applying the\nMoE architecture, offering a scalable blueprint for large-scale indus-\ntrial recommendation. Next, we find the necessity of modeling the\ncontextual information of target items in a session-wise generation\nmanner, proving contextual sequence modeling inherently captures\nuser preference dynamics better than isolated point-wise manner.\nFurthermore, we propose an Iterative Preference Alignment (IPA)\nstrategy to improve OneRec’s generalization across diverse user\npreference patterns. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B\ntesting verify the effectiveness and efficiency of OneRec. Addition-\nally, our analysis of online results reveals that, besides user watch\ntime, our model has limitations in interactive indicators, such as\nlikes. In future research, we aim to enhance the end-to-end genera-\ntive recommendation’s capability in multi-objective modeling to\nprovide a better user experience.",
            "content": "Figure 6: Scalability of OneRec on model scaling. The results show that OneRec constantly benefits from performance improvement when the parameters are scaled up. Compared to the OneRec baseline, OneRec+IPA exhibits significant confidence shift in prediction distributions, indicating that our proposed preference alignment strategy effectively encourages the base model to produce preferred generation patterns. Furthermore, we observe that the probability distribution in the first layer demonstrates greater divergence (entropy = 6.00) compared to subsequent layers (average entropy = 3.71 in the second layer and entropy = 0.048 in third layer), which exhibit progressively concentrated distributions. This hierarchical uncertainty reduction can be attributed to the autoregressive decoding mechanism: the initial layers predictions inherit higher uncertainty from preceding decoding steps, while later layers benefit from accumulated context that constrains the decision space."
