            "content": "In earlier stages of NLP, adversarial attacks primarily targeted the vulnerabilities of fine-tuned models on specific downstream tasks (Jin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Alzantot et al., 2018). However, with the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as Metas LLaMA family (Touvron et al., 2023) and OpenAIs GPT series (OpenAI, 2023), which are trained on massive datasets and capable of generalizing across broad spectrum of tasks without the need for fine-tuning, the landscape has shifted. These models have demonstrated remarkable versatility and applicability across various domains (Zhao et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; OpenAI et al., 2023), gaining significant influence in recent years. The prevalence of instruction tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022) has further en1https://github.com/ntuaislab/JUMP hanced LLMs ability to generate human-preferred responses, contributing to their widespread release as valuable tools and assistants. However, despite their utility, the pretraining datasets used for these models may contain unsafe content, which can lead to undesirable behavior when exposed to malicious user inputs (Ganguli et al., 2022; Zou et al., 2023). To mitigate this, safety alignments (Ziegler et al., 2019; Rafailov et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023) have been incorporated into the development of LLMs to reject unethical or harmful requests. To explore the blind spots of LLMs, early works attempted attacks using handwritten resources (Shen et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023a). Due to the inefficiency of these approaches, numerous attacks have proposed automated processes, with one of the most prominent being GCG (Zou et al., 2023), which searches for adversarial suffixes using gradient information. Unfortunately, since this strategy optimizes without considering the naturalness of the text, it can easily be detected as malicious request by defense techniques (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023), thereby reducing its effectiveness in such situations. To bypass the issues mentioned above, there has been increasing research focused on creating human-readable prompts. We categorize these works into two types. The first type involves assisting with set of pre-crafted prompts. representative work in this category is (Liu et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023), which investigates evolutionary algorithms to search for the most effective jailbreak prompt by iteratively editing pre-crafted templates. However, these approaches heavily rely on set of handcrafted prompts and cannot function without human-curated resources. The second type does not rely on pre-crafted prompts. notable example is BEAST (Sadasivan et al., 2024), which uses beam search decoding to find the best suffixes."

Previous work has focused on optimizing individual inputs, which can result in long training times and may seem inefficient. Another line of work focuses on more general settings. AdvPrompter (Paulus et al., 2024) aims to fine-tune the attacker to generate suffixes for each given input. Their experiments also demonstrate that the trained attacker exhibits good transferability to unseen instructions. Inspired by the insights mentioned above, we propose JUMP, jailbreak framework for optimizing universal multi-prompts. By leveraging an additional model as an attacker, we generate set of adversarial suffixes through the beam search process. The key contributions of our work are as follows: Our method, JUMP, is an extended version of BEAST, focusing on more general scenario without the need for training models. The first version of our algorithm, JUMP*, outperforms baselines without perplexity control. We acknowledge the trade-off between ASRs and perplexity and find that well-chosen initial seed set can mitigate this issue. Our experiments demonstrate that, with carefully designed initial prompts, the enhanced version of our method, JUMP++, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in the universal attack setting. Our algorithm also generalizes to defense scenarios."

            "content": "As more robust large language models have been released, the concept of jailbreaking has emerged. Researchers have attempted to craft prompts, such as DAN (Do Anything Now) (Shen et al., 2023), that describe the characteristics of the model and try to persuade it to act accordingly. However, such works (Shen et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023a) are resource-intensive and require significant human effort, making them inefficient. To reduce human effort in attacking, most research focuses on automatically generating adversarial prompts. The earliest works primarily concentrate on white-box attacks (Zou et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2021; Shin et al., 2020). Despite their success in achieving high attack success rates on widely-used models, these methods still suffer from high perplexity issues, which can easily be detected by defenses such as perplexity filters (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023). To mitigate this situation, several works aim to search for human-readable prompts. Notable works, such as AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2023), apply genetic algorithms to produce new attack samples, while GPTFuzzer (Yu et al., 2023), motivated by software testing techniques, generates new samples by manipulating different operators. Both of these methods heavily rely on external handcrafted resources. Another approach to finding readable inputs is directly rephrasing (Chao et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023). Inspired by notable prompting techniques (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023), this method utilizes an additional model to improve the rephrasing of harmful requests based on the interaction history. However, the approaches mentioned above can only optimize inputs individually. Several works (Wei et al., 2023b; Anil et al.) use incontext learning (Brown et al., 2020) by collecting harmful question-answer pairs as few-shot demonstrations, but these methods result in lower attack effectiveness. 2."

These approaches can be more efficient, as they aim to optimize group of malicious instructions and offer higher flexibility, allowing the trained attacker to generate customized suffixes for each input. While this approach seems ideal, training model may require deeper expertise and result in increased time and effort spent on hyperparameter tuning."

We follow the framework introduced in EasyJailbreak (Zhou et al., 2024b), which decomposes the jailbreak process into four components: Selector, Mutator, Constraint, and Evaluator. We demonstrate the procedure with this arrangement. In the main design of BEAST, the goal is to find an optimal adversarial suffix for given harmful instruction and its associated target y. We define an additional language model as our attacker, ϕ, and victim model, π. In the initial stage, the first tokens are sampled from the attacker ϕ to initialize the adversarial candidate set For the following optimization steps, to search for the best suffixes as attack prompts, we repeat the following steps: Mutator, Evaluator, and Selector, which are detailed as follows. Mutator: First, new candidates will be generated in this stage. For each template tempi, the input for the attacker inputi is formed by replacing the placeholder in tempi with , z2 the harmful instruction x. Beams of new toi , . . . zNc kens Zi = {z1 } will be multinomially sampled from the last token probability distribution ϕ(tokenized inputi) output by the attacker. Finally, we get the new beam candidates beami extended from temp(t1) as beami = {temp(t1) Zi}. i Evaluator: We evaluate each beam candidate beami extended from the template temp(t1) by calculating the target losses mentioned in Section 3.1 on the victim model π. The target loss function is denoted as L, and the target losses for each attack candidate in beami can be represented as: ℓij = Lπ(x, temp(t) ij , y) temp(t) ij beami, Selector: We merge the beams of candidates generated previously, = beami and their associated losses, = ℓi. Finally, we upi date the adversarial candidates with those having the minimum losses: arg min Initialization: Batches of data = {b1, b2, . . . , bM } , randomly sampled from the training set, will be assigned to each template respectively. Selector1: To avoid large training times for each epoch, we randomly sample candidates = {temp1, . . . , tempK} from the adversarial templates Q. Mutator: Following similar process to BEAST, we construct inputs formed by tempi combined with random instruction sampled from the batch data bi for the attacker. In this step, beams of candidates Beam = {beam1, . . . , beamK} will be generated. Evaluator: Instead of computing the loss on single instruction in BEAST, for each candidate tempij in beami , we compute the average of the losses on the corresponding batch data bi, which can be represented as: ℓij ="

Therefore, we further developed our method, JUMP*, which attempts to find set of multiprompts. The results in Table 1 show that, in most cases, we achieve better results than the baseline, AdvPrompter, at the cost of sacrificing the naturalness of context. We further apply perplexity constraint to JUMP*. The new version of our method, called JUMP, attempts to strike balance between perplexity and ASR. Unfortunately, despite the satisfactory results from the previous experiment, we observe significant performance drop after adding the perplexity constraint, as shown in Figure 2. We find that, after adding the constraint, the ASR@10 drops by more than 10 percentage points on both Llama models. Additionally, we discover that adjusting the temperature in the probability distribution during the Constraints step can indeed reduce perplexity, but it also penalizes the ASRs. To mitigate the issues, we aim to improve our method by incorporating additional handcrafted assistance during initialization. We randomly select sample template from the set of seed prompts proposed in AutoDAN. Then, we duplicate the sampled template to form the initial adversarial set. We compare this setting (denoted as JUMP initialized with AutoDAN) with the configurations shown in Figure 2, and the results in Table 9 demonstrate that the new approach effectively alleviates the tradeoffs.

The results, shown in Table 3, compare our method, initialized with JUMP++ and AutoDAN, to other baselines. We found that our method, initialized with templates from AutoDAN, achieves the best transfer results.

The comparison of our approach with other baselines is shown in Table 6. Additionally, the transfer results in Section 4.5.5 depend on initialization, with satisfactory results only achieved when initialized with AutoDAN prompts.

            "content": "A.1 Algorithms In our paper, we introduce the first version of our method, JUMP*, an algorithm that optimizes adversarial multi-prompts, focusing on attacking LLMs to generate jailbroken responses on set of malicious data. The details of JUMP* are shown in Algorithm 1. To address the issue of readability, we propose the final version, JUMP, which integrates perplexity control into JUMP*. The details of the Constraints step are shown in Algorithm 2. Our implementation for inference using the optimized adversarial set is showcased in Algorithm 3. A.2 Detail Settings in Experiments A.2.1 Environment We run our experiments on an Intel Xeon Gold 6226R CPU with an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. The environment is configured with Python 3.10.8. For the settings of each process in the universal jailbreak attack, we set the time limit to 150,000 seconds. In the defense setup, we also set the same time limit for optimizing defense multi-prompts in DUMP. A.2.2 Baseline Attacks We categorize all the baselines into two types: model-based and prompt-based. For model-based methods, they focus on fine-tuning attackers to generate adversarial suffixes. The baseline we use in our experiments is AdvPrompter, utilizing their official implementation4. For prompt-based baselines such as AutoDAN and GPTFuzzer, we utilize their official code56, and all of them are transformed into the multi-prompt setting, similar to JUMP, which splits data into batches and optimizes each candidate with the corresponding batch in the adversarial set. For the settings in the JUMP* experiments, we set the number of selected candidates in the Selector step to be 6 and the beam size Nc in the Mutator to be 50. The number of instructions in single batch is initialized to 20. We use 50 initial templates to form the adversarial set. We didnt apply perplexity constraints in the JUMP* experiments. Instead, we added constraints in the experiments with the extended method, 4https://github.com/facebookresearch/ advprompter which refers to JUMP and JUMP*. Most of the settings are the same as in JUMP*. The slight difference is that, for the main results of JUMP++, we scale the beam size Nc to 1.2 times larger than the original (Nc =60), and the sampled beam size is set to the same value as the original beam size =50). We set the perplexity temperature to (Nc 104. A.2.3 Baseline Defenses Time limit Setup In the defense experiments, we try different scenarios against individual attacks. For the individual attack experiments, time limit of 300 seconds is allocated per attack case under the no-defense scenario, and 480 seconds in other defense experiments (SmoothLLM, DUMP) to account for the additional runtime required for the defense process. Adversarial Data for Training In the defense experiments, we specifically choose AutoDAN as the attacker. Our method, DUMP, is training-based defense method. We use handcrafted templates released in their official implementation, randomly replacing instructions from the training set as the set of adversarial samples used for training defense prompts. Hyperparameter Settings We select several scenarios to compare with our method, DUMP. simple baseline we choose is SmoothLLM, which applies random perturbations to inputs. For readability, we set the perturbation percentage to 5%. We use the reimplemented version of the method 7. For the settings in the individual attack experiments, in the No Defense scenario, we directly feed the adversarial sample to the victim model. In the other scenarios, we protect victim models by augmenting adversarial inputs into multiple options and choosing the one that is less harmful. The number of augmented data is set to be 50 in both the SmoothLLM and DUMP settings. A.3 Supplementary Materials Comparison with Beam Search-Based Approaches We compare our method, JUMP, with beam search-based approaches and organize them into the table shown in Table 5. The analysis of their pros and cons is presented in Table 6.
