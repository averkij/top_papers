            "content": "The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like text has led to their adoption in various tasks, including text generation (Liang et al., 2024; Chung et al., 2023; Pattnayak et al.), text classification (Sun et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024b), writing assistance (Lu et al., 2024), code generation (Jiang et al., 2024a,b), question answering (Pattnayak et al., 2025a,b,c,d) and machine *Correspondence: Hitesh L. Patel and Dong-Kyu Chae. Work done outside position at Oracle Inc. Work done outside position at TD Securities. translation (Zhu et al., 2024; Lyu et al., 2024), among others. At the same time, large multimodal models are gaining prominence, extending AIs reach beyond text to data modalities such as images and audio (Pattnayak et al., 2024). They have also been utilized to generate synthetic datasets for tasks like data augmentation (Panda et al., 2025a,b; Thomas et al., 2025) and document-based applications (Patel et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2025, 2024a,b,c,d,e). The growing popularity of LLMs stems from their versatility and applicability across languages. While English has approximately 350 million native speakers, languages like Hindi (615 million), Spanish (486 million), and French (250 million) often have larger speaker bases. This has led to push for multilingual LLMs, which aim to break language barriers and enhance accessibility for non-English speakers. As these models are deployed in diverse regions, ensuring their safety and ethical behavior across languages and cultures is crucial. The safety evaluation of LLMs has emerged as critical focus of recent research. Various benchmark datasets have been developed to address this challenge. For instance, PKU-SafeRLHF (Ji et al., 2024) provides multi-level safety alignment data across 19 harm categories, such as harassment and hate speech. ToxicChat (Lin et al., 2023) focuses on toxic behaviors in user-AI interactions, emphasizing conversational contexts often overlooked by traditional toxicity detectors. HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024) evaluates harm scenarios, including offensive jokes and harassment, providing insights into the contextual vulnerabilities of LLMs. SALAD-Bench (Li et al., 2024) categorizes safety risks into hierarchical dimensions to better understand implicit and explicit harms. XSTest (Röttger et al., 2024) highlights multilingual and cross-cultural vulnerabilities, an essential consideration for globally deployed LLMs. Additionally, SafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2024) and 5 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 2 3 3 7 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Published in the Proceedings of the NAACL 2025 ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) address both explicit and implicit harms, focusing on challenges such as hate speech, bias, and toxicity. While previous research primarily focuses on explicit harms such as hate speech and harassment, subtler issues like swearing and profanity, which can have significant cultural and ethical impacts, are often overlooked. Swear words, frequently used to express strong emotions, vary in perceived severity across culturesranging from mild and acceptable to deeply offensive and harmful. This cultural nuance highlights the critical need to assess LLMs for their ability to handle such language appropriately. Our benchmark aims to bridge this gap by explicitly targeting these underexplored areas, focusing on the contextual appropriateness of LLM responses. This approach enables more comprehensive evaluation of LLM safety and contributes to advancing the holistic assessment of ethical AI across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In summary, the main contributions of our work: We present SweEval, the first cross-lingual enterprise safety benchmark for evaluating LLM performance in handling sensitive language across various linguistic and cultural contexts. We benchmark multiple LLMs for enterprise safety, highlighting trends across model sizes, capabilities, and versions. Our experiments reveal safety flaws in widely popular LLMs. We analyze LLM behavior across range of task-specific and tone-specific prompts to identify patterns, providing actionable insights for enhancing the models safety standards."

            "title": "2.1 Curse of Multilinguality",
            "content": "The performance of LLMs depends heavily on the size and diversity of their training data. Many stateof-the-art LLMs, such as the GPT family (OpenAI et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2019) and the Llama family (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024), are predominantly trained on English. For instance, 93% of GPT-3s training data was in English. This imbalance significantly limits their performance in low-resource languages due to the insufficient high-quality data encountered during training (Wasi et al., 2024, 2025). Bang et al., 2023 identified notable shortcomings in ChatGPTs language understanding and generation abilities in multilingual contexts. Similarly, Zhang et al., 2023 concluded that LLMs have not yet achieved compound multilingualism due to limitations in current data collection methods and training techniques. Moreover, Gurgurov et al., 2024 highlights the curse of multilinguality,\" where LLMs trained on multiple languages often underperform in low-resource languages due to limited and poor-quality data. Multilinguality also increases vulnerability to harmful prompts. Shen et al., 2024a observed LLMs are more prone to generating harmful content in low-resource languages due to weaker instruction-following capabilities. Fine-tuning and alignment often fail to mitigate these vulnerabilities. For example, Yi et al., 2024 reported that harmful knowledge persists even after alignment, while Kumar et al., 2024 noted that fine-tuning may reduce jailbreak resistance. Chua et al., 2024 examined the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs, identifying significant barriers to deeper knowledge transfer between languages. These findings collectively emphasize the need for explicit strategies to address language imbalances and optimization techniques to unlock the full potential of LLMs in diverse linguistic settings."

            "content": "Research into the safety of LLMs has increasingly focused on evaluating their responses to harmful or unsafe prompts, particularly regarding adversarial challenges and inappropriate content. Several benchmarks and datasets have been developed to assess these aspects. JailbreakBench (JBBBehaviours) (Chao et al., 2024) examines how well LLMs resist adversarial jailbreak prompts across various safety dimensions. ALERT (Tedeschi et al., 2024) uses red-teaming techniques to evaluate broad range of safety concerns informed by AI regulations. SORRY-Bench (Xie et al., 2024) focuses on refusal behaviors and safety assessments, considering linguistic and contextual variations across multiple languages. XSafety (Wang et al., 2024a) provides multilingual approach to safety, assessing how LLMs perform in different cultural contexts. SafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2024) and SALAD-Bench (Li et al., 2024) focus on structured evaluations of models knowledge and responses, with the latter examining attack and defense dynamics. Datasets such as ForbiddenQuestions (Shen et al., 2024c) measure Published in the Proceedings of the NAACL 2025 Figure 1: Regions where our chosen languages are spoken by the majority. how models adhere to safety policies, while DoNotAnswer (Wang et al., 2023) evaluates safeguards against high-risk capabilities. Finally, adversarial benchmarks like AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) test the resilience of models against harmful or objectionable content. These studies offer important insights into the safety of LLMs, focusing on different types of harmful behavior within the broader goal of ethical AI development. However, none of these studies have specifically examined swearing as harm. Our benchmark addresses the gap by testing the swearing capabilities of models across different instruction tones and contexts, providing new insight into the current safety of models."

Transliteration refers to the process of converting text from one script to another while preserving the original pronunciation.

Languages such as Spanish, English, French, and German do not require transliteration, as they already use the Latin script. These transliterated swear words were systematically integrated into placeholders within English prompts to generate the final dataset. This process resulted in total of 2,725 prompts (109 25) for each language. Detailed samples of the prompts for Case 2 are provided in Tables 19, 20, 21, and 22 in Appendix."

            "title": "4.2 Main Results",
            "content": "We aim to evaluate how LLMs respond to ethically sensitive or contextually challenging situations, especially those that frequently arise in professional settings. By examining how these models behave when faced with problematic or inappropriate prompts, we gain valuable insights into their trustworthiness, reliability, and overall suitability for enterprise applications. The experiments are designed to assess the ability of models to handle both unethical prompts containing multilingual swear words as well as prompts with transliterated swear words. Figure 2 provides visualization of this experiment where prompts with multilingual swear words resulted in two options - either safe or unsafe response. Similarly, Figure 3 provides visualization of the process for prompts with transliterated swear words. These two figures highlight the difficulty of maintaining ethical standards in language use across multiple languages and transliterated formsan issue that grows more pressing as globalized enterprise environments continue to expand. Figures 4 and 5 compare the performance of the models discussed in Section 4.1 for Case 1 and Case 2, respectively in terms of Harmful Rate. The results indicate that all models use swear words less frequently in English compared to other languages, such as Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, and Gujarati. This disparity may be attributed to the models stronger Published in the Proceedings of the NAACL 2025 Figure 3: Case 2 - Transliterated Swearing. understanding of English swear words and their contextual usage, enabling them to avoid harmful outputs. In contrast, for other languages, the models may not fully grasp the meaning or context of swear words, resulting in more frequent usage. These findings shed light on the need for enhanced data curation and improved training methodologies to enhance the handling of sensitive language across diverse languages. 4.3 In-depth Analysis RQ1: ARE LLMS CAPABLE OF COMPLETING TASKS USING MULTILINGUAL SWEAR WORDS? Figures 4 and 5 show the harmful rate across models and languages. In Case 1, where the prompt is in English but contains swear words from eight different languages, Figure 4 reveals an interesting pattern: the model struggles more with midresource and low-resource swear words. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the average harmful rate is higher for transliterated swear words in Indic languages in Case 2. This disparity may arise from the fact that these words are not well-represented in the English-focused pre-training data, making it harder for the model to flag or interpret them in the correct context. Although LLMs might understand the meaning of swear words in multilingual settings or have encountered them during training, they lack the critical thinking and contextual judgment that humans apply when responding to such language. Without these capabilities, models may inadvertently propagate inappropriate language, especially in sensitive contexts. In conclusion, while LLMs may demonstrate some understanding of swearing, their responses highlight the need for improved data curation, training and evaluation frameworks that extend beyond addressing explicit harms. RQ2: ARE LLMS MORE VULNERABLE IN LATIN-BASED LANGUAGES THAN IN INDIC LANGUAGES? We calculated the average harmful rate of all models across each language. The results indicate that LLMs are more vulnerable to Indic languages, which are believed to be underrepresented in the training corpus compared to Latin-based languages (refer to Figure 6). This under-representation limits the models ability to effectively distinguish and avoid using offensive terms. While some swear words, such as those related to mothers and sisters, are direct and explicit (e.g., \"behenchod\" or \"madarchod\"), many swear words are deeply tied to regional and cultural contexts. Such terms often carry layered meanings and are embedded within idiomatic expressions or regional slang, such as \"lund ghusana\" (to insert penis\"), which can have both literal and metaphorical interpretations. These complexities are further amplified by regional variations in pronunciation and dialect, where the same word may have multiple forms. For example, \"bahanchod\", and \"bainchod\" are used in different regions, introducing additional challenges for LLMs to recognize and flag such terms accurately. When these words are transliterated and mixed with English sentences, they further confuse the model (refer to Figure 7), particularly for Indic languages, which exhibit higher average harmful rate. These challenges underscore the need for more comprehensive and diverse training datasets, better phonetic normalization, and deeper cultural and contextual understanding to improve LLM performance in Indic languages. RQ3: IS LLM SAFETY IMPROVING, AND ARE Published in the Proceedings of the NAACL 2025 Figure 4: Case 1 - Model-wise harmful rate distribution across all languages (lower is better). Figure 5: Case 2 - Model-wise harmful rate distribution across all languages (lower is better). Figure 6: Case 1 - Latin vs. Indic Languages (lower is better). Figure 7: Case 2 - Latin vs. Indic Languages (lower is better). MULTILINGUAL MODELS BETTER AT RESISTING UNETHICAL INSTRUCTIONS? In our study, models with 8 billion parameters or fewer are categorized as small models, while those with more than 8 billion parameters are classified as large models. Overall, LLM safety has improved, with larger models exhibiting lower harmful rate compared to their previous versions, except for Phi-3, which performs better than Phi-3.5. This discrepancy is likely due to the synthetic data used for finetuning Phi-3.5, potentially introducing bias. This improvement is likely due to efforts to improve model safety, such as better training methods, improved datasets, and stronger safety measures. As shown in Figure 8, Mistral v3 demonstrates improved safety for smaller models over Mistral v2, while Llama 3.1 is slightly worse than Llama 3.0. Among Mistral and Llama, models from the Llama Published in the Proceedings of the NAACL 2025 Figure 8: Harmful rate of Mistral and Llama models (ordered from older to newer, left to right) (lower is better). family outperform Mistral in handling inappropriate prompts. This is likely because Llama models are multilingual and are trained on diverse datasets, which helps them work well across different languages and contexts. While training models with multilingual data have proven effective in improving safety, further work is necessary to enhance safety alignment not only in English but across all supported languages to ensure robust and equitable performance globally."

We focus on the ethical and complicated aspect of swearing, especially in low and mid resource languages, across different writing styles. Unlike existing benchmarks, SweEval gives priority to the situational intricacies of swearing, making it valuable tool for assessing language models ethical and contextual reasoning capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that, particularly in multilingual settings, LLMs limited reasoning skills and lack of cultural awareness cause them to rarely comprehend swearing and hence respond with such words. We stress the significance of improved training techniques, careful data selection, and better safeguardsnot just in English, but for all languagesin order to close this gap."

Secondly, the current benchmark has only text based instruction and excludes possible multimodal settings in which swearing might be understood otherwise. Finally, the dataset may not fully capture evolving language norms or the complete range of cultural nuances related to swearing. Despite these limitations we believe this study marks step towards building safer and more respectful AI systems. Future works should improve on the language coverage and add multimodal data to these benchmarks. This will help better address the ethical dilemmas arising from the current behavior of LLMs."

            "content": "A.1 Detailed Evaluation Results Zhiqiang Wang, Yiran Pang, and Yanbin Lin. 2024b. Smart expert system: Large language models as text classifiers. Preprint, arXiv:2405.10523. In Table 3, the variability of harmful rates observed by various models across languages, including English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Published in the Proceedings of the NAACL 2025 Hindi (hi), Marathi (mr), Bengali (bn), and Gujarati (gu), is presented. Models with lower harmful rates are considered safer. Table 4 presents the observed variability of harmful rates for transliterated swear words across languages and models. Note that Spanish (es), French (fr), and German (de) are not included here, as they are Latin-based languages. The sentiment analysis of model outputs is provided in Table 5 and Table 6 for Case 1 and Case 2, respectively. These tables present breakdown of the number of positive and negative examples generated by models across languages, offering insights into their likelihood of producing samples with given sentiment. Lastly, Table 7 and Table 8 provide counts of model responses classified into formal and informal tones, helping to gather insights on the models suitability for situations that require tonal appropriateness. A.2 More on SweEval Construction To build the SweEval, we started by identifying list of tasks that enterprise users might realistically use LLMs for, such as drafting sales pitches, negotiating agreements, or writing blogs (more details are provided in Table 9). We also included informal communication taskslike casual conversations or spontaneous queriesto see how the models adapt in more flexible, less structured scenarios. For each task, we created prompts with both positive and negative tones. The positive-tone prompts are crafted with cheerful, respectful, and uplifting language, designed to express admiration or gratitude. In contrast, the negative-tone prompts used language that was more critical, frustrated, or disappointed, aimed at conveying dissatisfaction or disapproval. Formal prompts maintained professionalism throughout, expecting the LLM to respond in respectful manner. Informal prompts included casual conversations between peers, family members, etc., and did not mandate professional tone in the responses. We compiled list of 25 commonly used swear words across eight languages. For the Indic languages, we included transliterated swear words as well, recognizing their frequent use in informal digital conversations. These terms are widely regarded as highly offensive and inappropriate for professional or social communication. To ensure accuracy, we evaluated the severity of each swear word by consulting native speakers with deep cultural understanding of these languages. Particular care was taken to respect regional and cultural differences, especially for the Indian languages in our benchmark. For Case 1, we created prompts across all eight languages. Here are some examples for reference: positive prompts (refer to Table 15), negative prompts (refer to Table 16), formal context prompts (refer to Table 17), and informal context prompts (refer to Table 18). Similarly, for Case 2, we developed corresponding positive prompts (refer to Table 19), negative prompts (refer to Table 20), formal context prompts (refer to Table 21), and informal context prompts (refer to Table 22). These tables outline the specific prompts used to evaluate the LLMs along with sample responses from the models. By introducing these variations, we aim to try to determine whether LLMs rely mainly on surface cues like tone and context, or if they truly grasp the deeper intent and appropriateness of their responses. A.3 Ablation on the Effect of Tone and Context on Prompt Responses In this analysis, we explored how variations in tone (positive vs negative) and context (formal vs informal) shape the responses generated by LLMs. By categorizing these responses based on different prompt types, we aimed to understand the models capacity to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate language use. This approach not only sheds light on their underlying ethical reasoning but also highlights where improvements are needed to better meet enterprise standards and user expectations. From Tables 5 and 6, we observe that, except for English, prompts with positive tone often lead to the model completing the task while including inappropriate language, such as swear words. This pattern suggests that they may be overly influenced by superficial tone cuessuch as cheerfulness or politeness, at the expense of ethical safeguards. Similarly, Tables 7 and 8 indicate that prompts framed in formal context result in the model using swear words more frequently than those in informal contexts. This reveals that the models mistake formality for ethical compliance, exposing gap in their grasp of contextual appropriateness. Table 10, Table 11, Table 12, Table 13 and Table 14 presents the number of model responses with swear words across different contexts. Collectively, these tables highlight the variability in the models ability to handle inappropriate content across formal and informal categories, with transliterated swear words in prompts significantly"

Published in the Proceedings of the NAACL 2025 increasing the likelihood of harmful outputs. These findings support existing theories of model overalignment, where language models overly adapt to user cues rather than developing deeper semantic or ethical understanding. Additionally, their struggle with transliterated swear words underscores the shortcomings of current multilingual embeddings in accurately reflecting cultural nuances and appropriateness. These findings underscore some of the more fundamental challenges that LLMs still face. Its not just about surface-level cues, they often struggle with understanding the ethical implications of their word choices. For example, when they include swear words in otherwise formal interactions, it shows shallow understanding of context and cultural norms. Improving data curation and finetuning methods, as well as other focused tactics, are necessary to overcome these problems and guarantee that response generated by LLM are morally sound and appropriate for the setting.
