            "content": "Retrieval-based language models have demonstrated strong performance on range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks (Lewis et al., 2020; Asai et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2024). At the core of these models is retriever that identifies relevant context to ground the generated output. Dense retrieval methods such as Contriever (Izacard et al., 2021)where passages or documents are stored as learned embeddingsare especially appealing for their scalability across large knowledge bases and handling lexical gaps (Ni et al., 2022; Shao et al., 1 Code and benchmark dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohsenfayyaz/ColDeR.

Document pairs are designed for controlled experiments shown in Table 1. Positive values indicate retrievers preference for the more biased document in each bias scenario, while for answer importance, they reflect preference for answer-containing documents. The results show that retrieval biases often outweigh the impact of answer presence. 2024), compared to alternatives like BM25 (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009) or ColBERT(Khattab and Zaharia, 2020). Despite their widespread use, relatively little is understood about how these dense models encode and organize information, leaving key questions about their robustness against adversarial attacks unanswered. Existing evaluations of retrieval models often focus on downstream task performance, as seen in benchmarks like BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021), without probing the underlying behavior of retrievers. Some studies have analyzed specific issues in information retrieval (IR) models, such as position bias (Coelho et al., 2024) or lexical overlap (Ram et al., 2023).

To enable finegrained control over document structure and factual positioning, we repurpose document-level relation extraction dataset (Re-DocRED (Tan et al., 2022)). We first investigate biases individually, identifying tendencies such as an over-prioritization of document beginnings, document brevity, repetition of matching entities, and literal matches at the expense of ignoring answer presence. Our statistical approach, illustrated in Figure 1, allows for comparative analysis across different biases. Additionally, we explore the interplay between these biases and propose an adversarial benchmark that combines multiple vulnerabilities. We further study combining multiple biases and reveal concerning patterns in current retriever architectures. When exposed to multiple interacting biases, even top-performing models exhibit dramatic degradation, selecting the answer-containing document over the foil documentfilled with biasesless than 3% of the time. Moreover, we demonstrate that these biases can be exploited to manipulate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), causing retrievers to favor misleading or adversarially constructed documents, which misguide LLMs into using incorrect information and ultimately degrade its performance."

            "content": "Benchmarking in Information Retrieval Popular benchmarks like BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2021; Petroni et al., 2021; Muennighoff et al., 2023) have played crucial role in evaluating retrieval models across diverse datasets and tasks. In addition to general IR benchmarks, domainspecific benchmarks such as COIR (Li et al., 2024) for code retrieval and LitSearch (Ajith et al., 2024) for scientific literature search address retrieval challenges in specialized domains. While these benchmarks have advanced the evaluation of IR models, they primarily focus on downstream performance rather than conducting systematic analyses of biases inherent in retrieval systems. Information Retrieval Model Analysis Prior work in information retrieval has explored various dimensions of retrieval performance, including positional biases (Coelho et al., 2024). Studies have also examined how dense retrievers exhibit biases towards common entities and struggle with OOD scenarios (Sciavolino et al., 2021). Furthermore, analysis by projecting representations to the vocabulary space has shown that supervised dense retrievers tend to learn relying heavily on lexical overlap during training (Ram et al., 2023). Similarly, BehnamGhader et al. (2023) has indicated that Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) models often fail to retrieve statements requiring reasoning beyond surface-level similarity. Furthermore, neural IR models have been shown to exhibit overpenalization for extra information, where adding relevant sentence to document can unexpectedly decrease its ranking (Usuha et al., 2024). Additionally, Reichman and Heck (2024) takes mechanistic approach to analyze the impact of DPR finetuning, showing that while fine-tuned models gain better access to pre-trained knowledge, their retrieval capabilities remain constrained by the preexisting knowledge in their base models. Further, MacAvaney et al. (2022) provides framework for analyzing neural IR models, identifying key biases and sensitivities in these models. Adversarial Attacks in Information Retrieval Numerous studies have explored various dimensions of robustness in information retrieval, including aspects related to adversarial robustness (Liu et al., 2024). Adversarial perturbations, for instance, have been shown to significantly degrade BERT-based rankers performance, revealing their brittleness to subtle modifications (Wang et al., 2022). Existing retrieval attack methods primarily encompass corpus poisoning (Lin et al., 2024; Zhong et al., 2023), backdoor attacks (Long et al., 2024), and encoding attacks (Boucher et al., 2023). While previous work has analyzed some retrieval biases, most studies focus on task-specific supervised models and single aspect in isolation. Our work provides comprehensive comparative analysis of popular retrieval models across multiple dimensions of vulnerability. We systematically investigate how these biases interact and affect the retrieval capabilities of dense retrievers. By repurposing relation extraction dataset, we gain precise control over factual information in documents, enabling rigorous evaluation of retrieval robustness. This multi-dimensional approach provides nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of dense retrievers."

For our analysis, we ensure that each query has single evidence sentence (Sev) within the original document (S Dorig) that contains both the head and tail entities. This constraint makes the sentence self-contained, allowing for precise control over the document structure in subsequent sections. We also introduce the notation S+h for sentences in Dorig that contain the head entity but not the tail entity, and Sh for sentences that do not contain either entity. In each of the following sections, we will use this notation to construct pair of document sets, D1 and D2, enabling systematic investigation of retrieval score variations and potential biases. As result, for each of our six analysis settings, we compile 250 queries, each with single corresponding gold document, based on the test and validation sets of Re-DocRED."

Table 2 shows that Dragon models lead in performance, and the significant improvement of fine-tuned Contriever over its unsupervised counterpart highlights the importance of supervision and task-specific adaptation. Models also differ in pooling mechanisms, with Contriever using average pooling and others using CLS pooling. For details, refer to the appendix A.1. In our preliminary analysis, we utilized DecompX (Modarressi et al., 2023, 2022), method that decomposes the representations of encoderbased models such as BERT into their constituent token-based representations. By applying DecompX to the embeddings generated by dense retrievers, we obtain decomposed representations for both the query and the document. Instead of using the original embeddings, we compute the similarity score via dot product of the decomposed vectors. This approach enables us to visualize the contribution of each query and document token to the final similarity score as heatmap (Figure 2), revealing biases in token-level interactions. In our preliminary error analysis of 60 retrieval failure examples, we identified potential biases and limitations in the models (Table A.3). Figure 2 highlights some of these biases, such as Literal Bias, where the term \"esteban gomez\" fails to match \"estevao gomez,\" reflecting preference for exact matching. In subsequent sections, we design experiments and perform statistical tests to evaluate these observed biases."

In contrast, Contriever exhibits poor performance, yielding negative t-statistics that indicate failure to properly distinguish answer-containing passages. The vanilla Contrievers underwhelming performance can be attributed to its unsupervised training methodology, which differs from models trained on MS MARCO (Bajaj et al., 2018).

However, our analysis reveals that current models exhibit strong bias toward exact literal matches rather than semantic matching. In our dataset, each head entity can be represented by multiple alternative names. To investigate literal bias, we created different combinations of query and document by replacing all head entities with the shortest or longest name variants as illustrated in Table 1 (Literal Bias). For example, an entity might be represented as \"NYC\" (shortest) or \"New York City\" (longest), allowing us to test how the model performs when matching different 5Fig. 1 shows the impact of evidence placement (beginning vs. end), detailed in Appendix A, with an example in Table 1. combinations of these representations.

This bias is problematic because retrievers may favor shorter, non-relevant document over relevant one. We will discuss this potential hazard further in Section 3.5. Here, we performed paired t-tests to compare the similarity scores of queries with two sets of documents: (1) Single Evidence, consisting of only the evidence sentence, and (2) Evidence+Document, consisting of the evidence sentence followed by the rest of the document. The examples are carefully selected to ensure the evidence sentence includes both the head and tail entity and the rest of the document contains no repetition of the head entity or additional evidence.

To analyze repetition bias, we conducted an experiment evaluating the average retrieval dot product score of the models for samples with varying document lengths and head entity repetitions (Figure 5 and A.5). key concern is that longer documents naturally have higher chance of lexical overlap with the query, as they may contain more repeated mentions of the head entity. This makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of document length from the number of entity repetitions. Therefore, we structure our analysis to separately examine these two factors. Our findings (Figure 5) reveal that the retrieval score increases with the number of head entity mentions, indicating preference for documents with repeated entities. Conversely, the retrieval score decreases as document length increases, suggesting that longer documents are penalized despite potential relevance. Figure A.5 in the appendix generalizes these observations across all models. This experiment highlights the trade-off between repetition and document length, emphasizing the need for retrieval systems to balance these factors to mitigate bias.

Specifically, we generate this sentence using GPT4o by replacing the tail entity with contextually plausible but entirely incorrect entity. This approach ensures that the poisoned document both exploits the previously discussed retrieval biases and contains an incorrect answer to the query. D1 := 2 + S+h D2 := 4 Sh + S+h + Sev + 4 Sh +P oisonT ail (7) that combines several bias types into single challenging setup. In this experiment, we created two document types. 1) Foil Document with Multiple Biases: This document contains multiple biases, such as repetition and position biases. It includes two repeated mentions of the head entity in the opening sentence, followed by sentence that mentions the head but not the tail (answer). So it does not include the evidence. 2) Evidence Document with Unrelated Content: This document includes four unrelated sentences from another document, followed by the evidence sentence with both the head and tail entities. The document ends with the same four unrelated sentences. An example is shown in Table 1 (Foil vs. Evide.). Table 5 reports the RAG accuracy,9 showing that, as expected, providing the evidence document enables the LLM to achieve high accuracy. However, since retrievers prefer the foil document from 3.4, which lacks evidence, LLM performance drops to levels near10 the no-document condition. This preference is concerning, as it allows biases to be exploited, making certain documents more likely to be retrieved despite embedding incorrect information. This is evident with the poisoned document, which degrades performance even worse than presenting no document by introducing false facts. In summary, retriever biases can mislead RAG systems by providing poisoned or non-informative documents, ultimately harming performance. D1 := 2 + S+h D2 := 4 Sh + Sev + 4 Sh t"

The results are striking: all models exhibit extremely poor performance, with accuracy dropping below 3%. The paired t-test statistics are highly negative across all models, indicating consistent preference for foil documents over the correct evidence-containing ones. This outcome highlights the severity of bias interplay and its detrimental impact on model reliability. Furthermore, sufficient number of biased documents can potentially cause the model to select all top-k documents from only biased results. 3."

            "content": "To assess the impact of the identified vulnerabilities on RAG systems, we use GPT-4o models (OpenAI et al., 2024) and provide them with different versions of the reference document for given query. Additionally, we construct poisoned document by modifying the foil document from 3.4, introducing poisoned evidence sentence (Table A.5). 7 are sentences from an unrelated document In this work, we introduced comprehensive framework for analyzing biases in dense retrieval models. By leveraging relation extraction dataset (Re-DocRED), we constructed diverse set of controlled experiments to isolate and evaluate specific biases, including literal, position, repetition, and brevity biases as well as the answers importance. Our findings reveal that retrieval models often prioritize superficial patterns, such as exact string matches, repetitive content, or information positioned early in documents, over deeper semantic understanding and the existence of the answer. Moreover, when multiple biases combine, retriever performance deteriorates dramatically. Furthermore, Our analysis shows that retriever biases can undermine RAGs reliability by favoring poisoned or non-informative documents over evidence-containing ones, leading to degraded performance of LLMs. These findings underscore the need for dense retrieval models that are robust to biases and capable of prioritizing semantic relevance. 8Despite this, retrievers prefer the poisoned document over the evidence document in 100% of cases (Table A.4). 9Evaluated using GPT-4o.

To mitigate this, we employ statistical tests and report error margins and p-values to ensure the robustness of our findings. Limitations of RAG Evaluation by LLMs In our RAG experiments, we utilized GPT-4o models and carefully designed prompts (Table A.6) to poison documents, generate answers using RAG, and evaluate the results against gold-standard answers. Although GPT-4o is one of the most advanced models available, it is not infallible and may introduce some variance in the RAG results and evaluations. Nevertheless, we believe the observed trends and findings remain valid given the models high performance and the consistency of our experimental setup."

            "content": "A.1 Models Downstream Performance We evaluate several dense retrievers on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), comparing their performance using standard retrieval metrics: nDCG@10 and Recall@1011. The models differ in training objectives, datasets, and pooling mechanisms, offering comprehensive view of their retrieval capabilities in our experimental setup. Table 2 (and A.2) summarizes the results. Dragon RoBERTa and Dragon+ (Lin et al., 2023) demonstrate the highest performances due to diverse data augmentations and multiple supervision sources, which progressively enhance their generalization.12 COCO-DR (Yu et al., 2022) adopts continuous contrastive learning and implicit distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to address distribution shifts in dense retrieval tasks. It exhibits moderate performance, scoring lower than Dragon models. Contriever (Izacard et al., 2021) uses unsupervised contrastive learning but performs poorly without fine-tuning (nDCG@10: 0.25). Fine-tuning on MSMARCO significantly improves its performance (nDCG@10: 0.50), underscoring the importance of fine-tuning for robust retrieval. RetroMAE (Xiao et al., 2022), which introduces retrieval-oriented pre-training paradigm based on Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE), featuring innovative designs like asymmetric masking, achieves slightly lower performance (nDCG@10: 0.48) compared to fine-tuned Contriever. The models also differ in their pooling mechanisms. Contriever uses average pooling, where token representations are averaged to form dense vector for retrieval. In contrast, the other models use CLS pooling, where the representation of the [CLS] token is taken as the sentence embedding. In summary, Dragon models lead in performance, and the significant improvement of finetuned Contriever over its unsupervised counterpart highlights the importance of supervision and taskspecific adaptation in dense retrieval. A.2 Position Bias: First vs. Last Further evidence is provided in Figure A.2, where we compared two document variants: 11Using BEIR framework (Thakur et al., 2021) 12Dragon RoBERTa is initialized from RoBERTa and Dragon+ from RetroMAE 1. Beginning-Evidence Document D1: The evidence sentence is positioned at the start of the document. 2. End-Evidence Document D2: The same evidence sentence is positioned at the end of the document. D1 := Sev + (cid:88) Sh D2 := (cid:88) Sh Dorig Sh + Sev (8) Sh Dorig An example of the document pairs (Position Bias) is shown in Table 1. The resulting t-statistics (Figure 1 and A.2), where higher positive values indicate stronger preference for evidence at the beginning (D1) over the end (D2), provide another clear metric of positional bias. These results serve as foundation for our subsequent analysis in the interplay between biases section."
