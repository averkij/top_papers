            "content": "Can computational models, like humans, conceive and create complex machines to achieve purposeful goals? At the heart of this question lie two tightly coupled concepts: compositionality, how parts are put together into assemblies, and functionality, the tasks these assemblies perform as they interact with external forces or inputs. While foundation models are already capable of synthesizing 3D shapes and building mechanical parts with computer-aided design (CAD) models, it is the complex compositional structures, in which very different parts and components are orchestrated to smoothly move together, that realize vast array of demands. Just as clock emerges from the composition of simple and standardized mechanical elements such as gears and flywheels, these same elements, when combined differently, can give rise to entirely different machines, such as sewing machine. On the other hand, the same functionality may be realized by different part compositions, just as both cars and bicycles can transport person from place to place. Put it concisely: composition is shaped by functionality, and functionality is realized through composition. Since such compositional machines can be expressed programmatically, with types, placements and articulations of parts represented in structured code that LLMs can generate and manipulate, we formalize the above question as: Can LLMs, given standardized mechanical parts and reward function for the desired functionality, discover diverse spatial part compositions that maximize the reward and complete the task? The question is not only about the pursuit of intelligence but also about the practice of engineering. Modern design pipelines are often long and costly, especially in large-scale projects where each iteration demands substantial resources. These projects accumulate vast collections of documents and blueprints, making it difficult to trace, retrieve, or reuse past design efforts. Much essential knowhow is passed informally across teams and generations, and in many cases, never fully recorded and since forgotten. An automated machine design system could directly address these challenges. Rather than merely mimicking patterns from historical designs, such system should be agentic: capable of exploring the exponentially large design space, leveraging prior knowledge to create novel designs for new demands and constraints, and improving them through feedback. To investigate this concretely, we introduce BesiegeField, an interactive environment built on the machine-design game of Besiege1. The environment allows for construction of simple mechanical machines with standardized and semantic parts such as gears and wheels, and supports customized physical scenarios in which LLM agents can test constructed machines and evaluate their dynamics and interactions. Building on BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with different agent designs and strategies for selecting and placing basic mechanical elements to build machines for representative functional demands, task we term compositional machine design. Through these experiments, we empirically identify key capabilities required for this task: accurate spatial reasoning, high-level knowledge of design strategies, and instruction-following in spatial domains. Since only few proprietary LLMs achieve satisfactory results, we further investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) can improve the performance of open-source LLMs. To this end, we curate small machine design dataset to cold-start RL finetuning, perform exploratory RL experiments, and highlight key challenges that chart directions for future research. In summary, our contributions are listed below: We introduce and formalize the task of compositional machine design, where machines are assembled from standardized parts to achieve functional goals. We present BesiegeField, an interactive environment that enables LLM agents to construct, simulate, and evaluate compositional machines in customized physical scenarios. We systematically benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs and different agentic workflow designs on representative machine-design tasks. We explore RL finetuning of LLMs on this task, for which we curate cold-start dataset, conduct experiments, and highlight the key challenges."

            "content": "isolate tractable subproblem, we focus on the structural composition of machines: how standardized parts are spatially arranged and mechanically linked to produce functional behavior. We refer to this task, introduced in the previous section, as compositional machine design. It captures two essential components: (i) the static geometry of machine as part-based assembly, and (ii) its compatibility with functional demands, typically assessed through physical simulation. This abstraction omits considerations such as manufacturing constraints, material properties, or domain-specific regulations, but retains the core spatial and behavioral reasoning challenges relevant to design. This special task of compositional machine design mirrors challenges found in other exploration domains. For example, automatic theorem proving involves compositional and exponentially large action space, while electronic design automation (EDA) for chip layouts requires spatial reasoning to place components of varying shapes under spatial constraints (albeit in more regular and grid-constrained fashion than mechanical parts in machines). unique challenge in machine design, however, is its dependence on diverse long-horizon behaviors, both autonomous and nonautonomous, within an environment. Specifically, machine may behave differently when operated in different ways (e.g., bicycle when pedaled versus when braking) or under different external conditions (e.g., driving car in sunny versus rainy weather). Similarly, many sophisticated machines cannot function without appropriate control policies, as exemplified by aircraft that rely on fly-by-wire systems to stabilize their inherently unstable aerodynamic configurations (which would otherwise be unflyable by human pilot alone). key open problem is therefore how to account for the interplay among physics, control policy, and compositional structure in machine design. It is worth noting that, unlike in math theorem proving where one valid proof often suffices (even though multiple proofs may still be valued), design domains typically require generating diverse set of candidate solutions. This diversity is essential to (i) differentiate products, (ii) adapt to unpredictable market demands, and (iii) account for uncertainty in real-world testing and deployment. Consequently, the task places greater emphasis on diversity, and model for compositional machine design should function more like generative model than simple reward maximizer."

            "content": "Studying the full problem of compositional machine design is challenging, as it involves the coupling of many interacting factors. We therefore focus on minimalist, component-level setting in which machines are constructed primarily from cuboid primitives with clear functional semantics, together with small set of specialized exceptions, and operate under shared control policy in an environment governed by rigid-body and elastic mechanics. This abstraction allows us to properly benchmark the capabilities of existing LLMs and to assess the upper bounds, potential, and challenges of agentic systems and RL algorithms. To this end, we create BesiegeField, an interactive environment adapted from the machine-building game Besiege, in which players design medieval machines to complete tasks such as destroying castles. Powered by the built-in physics engine, BesiegeField supports physical simulation of mechanical systems such as vehicles and catapults in user-customized environments with terrains, obstacles, external forces (e.g., wind and gravity), and co-existing agents. The environment provides nearly 80 types of building blocks (examples illustrated in Fig. 10), including passive ones like drills and logs, and powered ones like powered cogs and wheels. Machines are constructed by sequentially attaching new parts to vacant and attachable faces of existing blocks, starting from root block and thus forming construction tree (indeed directly acyclic graph (DAG), in the sense of operation orders; one block can has two parents in the DAG; the actual structures may contain loops). Powered blocks can receive control commands, allowing machines to be operated precisely. During simulation, complete state information (e.g., the position and velocity of each block in the constructed machine) can be recorded for model feedback. Finally, the environment supports custom modifications and can be extended with additional block types and richer physics (e.g., simple fluid simulation). Further details are explained in Appendix B. BesiegeField is unique in balancing real-world geometry and physics, part-level semantics, and simple compositional rules. Block-stacking environments like LEGO (Fan et al., 2022) and Minecraft (Fan et al., 2022; Pun et al., 2025) allow intuitive combinatorial assembly but do not natively provide realistic physical simulation and rely on generic blocks with limited semantic meaning. CAD modeling (Li et al., 2025) captures fine-grained geometry and interactions, but its complexity makes rules cumbersome and sequences prohibitively long. By contrast, BesiegeField"

            "content": "Representative target machines and tasks. To benchmark and characterize the performance of different LLMs for agentic compositional machine design, we consider two conceptually simple yet representative target machines to build: car and catapult as shown in Fig. 2. While success in both requires understanding part semantics and structural syntax, car building primarily tests static relational reasoning, such as enforcing correct part orientations, symmetry, and stability; in contrast, catapult building challenges models with dynamic relational reasoning, where parts must coordinate over time to produce causal mechanical effects. Moreover, the two tasks are simple enough to be constructed with only few blocks so that they fit within the LLMs context window, yet complex enough to require explicit reasoning about construction strategies and causal dependencies. We evaluate the performance of cars and catapults by their moving distance and their throwing distance (i.e., the moving distance of the stone), respectively, towards fixed and given direction. During each simulation, the generated machine will be placed at designated position, and the active parts will be powered after few seconds. As there can be reward hacking issues, for catapults experiments we surround the designated machine placement position with moderate-height walls. More details about the target machines, rewards, and environments can be found in Appendix B. Machine representations. In BesiegeField, the default XML representation records all blocks with global 3D positions and uses built-in algorithm to recover connections. Such representation, however, does not well encode machine structures. Instead, we propose parsimonious representation aligned with the games building logic, based on pairwise relative attachment relationships (i.e., how one part is rotated and attached to another). Details are explained in Appendix D.3. Performance metrics. We evaluate our agentic systems using the following quantitative metrics: 1) file validity rate, the proportion of generated JSON files that can be successfully parsed into machine construction trees; 2) spatial validity rate, the proportion of generated machines that are free from self-collisions; 3) machine validity rate, the proportion of machines that satisfy both file and spatial validity; 4) mean and maximum simulation scores, the average and highest rewards achieved by generated machines in the environment."

Specifically, one LLM agent is provided with the environment description, the available machine components, the assembly syntax, and the functional requirements (e.g., moving an object forward). The agent generates chain-of-thought (CoT; Wei et al. (2022)) to reason about what is needed and why, and then derives an abstract plan (e.g., connecting lever to container with boulder). This plan is later translated into the construction tree representation. Iterative editing. Because compositional machine design requires both low-level spatial reasoning and high-level ideation, single agent rarely produces satisfactory machines. We therefore also design an iterative editing workflow that involves three major agents: 1) designer, which produces an initial plan from the environment description, the available machine components, the assembly syntax, and the functional requirements; 2) refiner, self-critic agent that which evaluates draft against requirements and constraints and proposes multiple candidate revisions at each step; 3) environment querier, an agent that runs machine simulation and summarizes the environment feedback, in the way that it always provides global information such as machine orientation throughout the trajectory but selectively reports the feedback on specific blocks (e.g., position and speed) for further machine refinement.

At refiner stages, multiple candidates are generated for running Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS; Coulom (2006)). The best design found in this search process is selected as output. Hierarchical construction. Inspired by typical human design processes as well as recent designs of agentic systems (Xiao et al., 2025; Teng et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025), we introduce meta-designer agent that first analyzes the requirements and constraints, and then constructs highlevel blueprint of the major functional blocks (e.g., the suspension system) and their interconnections. With this blueprint in place, we adopt an autoregressive strategy to build the machine block by block: 1) we begin with the first functional block and dispatch the job to eight parallel builder agents; 2) the valid designs from this stage are evenly distributed to another eight builder agents to construct the second block; and 3) the process iterates in this manner until the entire machine is assembled. Empirically, we find that the meta-designer typically decomposes machine into three to four functional blocks. Figure 6: Our agentic machine design workflow."

Effect of environment feedback. It is unsurprising that with the more environment feedback the agents receive, the better performance of generated machines improve in general  (Table 12)  . Effect of edit history. We find that edit histories are generally helpful in decreasing the number of failure attempts in creating valid machines  (Table 6)  , which underscores the importance of longer context window of base models for efficient exploration. Hierarchical design. We observe the mean performance improves with hierarchical design only when the abstract-level reasoning on blueprints is reliable, as shown by the performance of Gemini 2.5 Pro. In the meantime, consistent with the intuition that hierarchical design is more structured and principled, it generally yields lower variance in obtained scores. Effect of CoT reasoning. As shown in Fig. 18, LLMs often fail to faithfully translate high-level machine design plans in their CoT into semantically and geometrically consistent machine construction trees. To better assess the impact of CoT reasoning on high-level design, we feed the CoT generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro (the best-performing model) to other LLMs, prompting them to directly output construction trees. The resulting machines generally show improved performance  (Fig. 31)  and highlight the critical role of high-level semantic reasoning in machine design. CoT-machine correspondence. Though the CoT often provides reasonably high-level blueprint, agents may still generate machines that deviate from the intended structure  (Fig. 18)  . We hypothesize that this misalignment is key reason many LLMs struggle to build better machines. Machine representation. We experiment with coordinate-only representation derived from the default XML (Appendix D.1) and our construction tree representation. Results show that the coordinate-only representation performs significantly worse  (Table 7)  , implying that explicit structural information is necessary for LLM understanding. 3D information. We observe that  (Table 5)  the performance generally improves when we also feed parsed 3D information into the context of LLMs, which implies that LLMs are less capable of understanding relative spatial relationship (e.g., construction trees)."

Specifically, we collected textual descriptions of machine functionalities from Besiege player communities and prompted Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate corresponding machines.

Similar to observations in many other RLVR settings, the entropy of the output distribution quickly drops even with regularization. Pass@k advantage vs. Pass@1 advantage. Since we eventually care about the best performing designs, especially given the low validity rate, our default setting adopts Pass@k advantage estimator. Indeed, Pass@k finetuning is more likely to discovery promising machine designs  (Fig. 23)  . Evolution of generated machines during finetuning. In Fig. 8, we qualitatively examine how models refine their designs over the course of finetuning. We observe that models typically make detail-level adjustments, such as shifting part positions, while keeping the same high-level design strategy rather than exploring alternative strategies. Although these strategies are often reasonable, the models struggle to find precise configurations that enable smooth coordination among parts. This precision is especially critical for sophisticated mechanisms like catapults to function properly. Figure 8: Designs at RL finetuning stages. Cold-start. Not surprisingly, we find that cold-start alone does not enable models to produce satisfactory designs, and that finetuning on the cold-start model is better than on the base model  (Table 2)  ."

            "content": "Capabilities for compositional machine design. Although tasks such as visual understanding and generation also depend on spatial, physical, and semantic reasoning, compositional machine design introduces unique requirements for LLM capabilities. Without precise spatial placement of machine parts, design may fail to function correctly; gear train, for example, will not transmit rotation if the gears are misaligned. Since the design process is typically hierarchical, successful LLMs must be able to accurately translate high-level blueprints into detailed geometric designs. In addition, machine design spans both concept-level reasoning and detailed specification. This dual demand often leads to large design documents and calls for form of visual reasoning expressed through text, similar to what has been studied in LLMs applied to scalable vector graphics (SVG) and CAD models (Qiu et al., 2025b; Alrashedy et al., 2025). Multimodal reasoning is also important because effective machine design typically relies on integrating textual descriptions with visual or schematic representations. In this work, however, we focus only on pure LLM-based reasoning to isolate and analyze its capabilities for compositional machine design. Challenges in agentic machine design systems. The task of machine design faces similar challenges found in agentic systems in domains such as legal services and other knowledge-intensive fields. key difficulty is the highly varied requirements and domain knowledge of different customers. To address this, LLMs need to acquire task-specific knowledge through in-context learning or finetuning. In addition, the complexity of design tasks often requires multiple agents to coordinate, and such pipelines can suffer error accumulation when the base LLM lacks sufficient capability. Exploration in machine design space. Different from tasks such as theorem proving, the goal of compositional machine design is to discover structures that more effectively achieve desired func-"

Rather than reusing existing solutions, practical design agent should be able to propose novel strategies, structural layouts, and part specifications as machine complexity increases. Meeting this requirement calls for RL finetuning methods that prevent models from collapsing into narrow set of strategies and structures, which recent methods aim to alleviate (Zhu et al., 2025b; Chen et al., 2025c; Cui et al., 2025; Cheng et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025b). This demand is closely related to continual RL (Schwarz et al., 2018), since finetuned LLMs must avoid catastrophic forgetting, maintain its reasoning ability, and consolidate learned strategies, which is particularly important because large-scale machine design datasets are rare and commercially infeasible to collect."

            "content": "3D graphics codes for generative modeling. There is long history in 3D asset generation and engineering design of representing the construction of target instance as program or sequence of operations in domain-specific language (Ritchie et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2022), which we refer to here as 3D graphics codes (Qiu et al., 2025b; Chen et al., 2025a). Unlike geometric representations such as point clouds or meshes, these codes describe objects at higher semantic level, capturing part composition, design constraints, and user operations in modeling software. Similar to programming languages, 3D graphics codes are inherently discrete and are typically generated with autoregressive models trained from scratch (Yuan et al., 2024) or with LLMs finetuned on curated datasets (Kulits et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025b). Much of the existing work centers on CAD scripts for individual parts (Wu et al., 2023; Alrashedy et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025) or Blender macros for single assets (Huang et al., 2024). Whereas recent studies on LEGO assemblies (Pun et al., 2025), Minecraft structures (Fan et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2025a), and procedural scene generation (Sun et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a; Jones et al., 2025; Yuan et al., 2024) introduce richer compositionality, they still fall short of the task of compositional machine design, which requires assemblies that both function under physical laws and exhibit the precise geometry of real objects. LLM agents. LLM agents are language models organized to operate in iterative loops of perception and action (Yao et al., 2023b; Minaee et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024c). They interact with external tools (Schick et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b; Kim et al., 2024; Qin et al., 2024), respond to signals from simulated or real environments (Savva et al., 2019; Shridhar et al., 2021), incorporate selfreflection to refine their outputs (Hu et al., 2024b; Alrashedy et al., 2025; Shinn et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2025), and are commonly organized into multi-agent systems that coordinate roles and exchange information (Li et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025) . These designs move beyond one-shot text generation and establish LLMs as adaptive decision makers capable of long-horizon reasoning. Approaches that introduce search over possible solutions (Yao et al., 2023a; Putta et al., 2024; Koh et al., 2024) or reflection on prior attempts (Besta et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2024; Renze & Guven, 2024; Xiao et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025) have enabled progress on increasingly complex tasks. LLM agents have already been used in design tasks such as code synthesis (Gao et al., 2023; Novikov et al., 2025; Madaan et al., 2023), CAD design (Alrashedy et al., 2025) and game environments (Wang et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2022). Partially inspired by these developments, Makatura et al. (2023) proposed prototypical agent-based design framework that generates mechanical structures from text prompts. Their system treats structure generation as one-shot process and delegates the search for optimal geometric and physical parameters to external optimization tools. In contrast, our work with BesiegeField explores how LLM agents can directly and iteratively bridge compositional structures to functional goals, framing design as process of reasoning and adaptation with both accurate simulation and intuitive physics. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Recent studies indicate that, by running RL finetuning with verifiable rewards from simulators or verifiers, reasoning abilities emerge (Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025; Bai et al., 2022), even when single prompt is used during finetuning (Wang et al., 2025). Yet, many methods exhibit loss of diversity as output entropy collapses during reinforcement learning and thus do not fully enable LLMs to explore novel solutions. Examples of mitigation methods include explicit entropy or KL regularization (Cui et al., 2025; Ouyang et al., 2022), Pass@k training (Tang et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025c), and distribution-matching objectives like generative flow networks (Zhu et al., 2025b; Hu et al., 2024a). BesiegeField provides verifiable rewards and thus enables direct application of RLVR to compositional machine design. Concluding remarks. We introduced compositional machine design, simplified yet challenging task that reflects core aspects of real-world machine design. To evaluate LLM performance on this"

            "content": "We built BesiegeField by creating plug-in modules for the game Besiege that create interfaces to allow flexible composition of parts (once certain rules are obeyed), control policies on multiple powered parts (e.g.. powered cogs), recording of state information of any block (e.g., position, orientation, part integrity, etc.) and settings of termination conditions (e.g., some part passing through line). BesiegeField supports multi-process launching and thus allows for efficient parallel RL training. As the game natively supports multi-player gameplay, BesiegeField can naturally be applied to multi-agent RL settings. As the game Besiege (shown in Fig. 9) is built with the (mostly) opensourced Unity3D game engine2, BesiegeField is highly-customizable: the environment 1) natively supports modification of physical parameters, external forces, terrains and obstacles (e.g., stone buildings) and 2) allows for extension patches (known as mods3) to introduce other mechanisms, such as new block types, fluid simulation and many other components. Figure 9: Besiege editor view. B.1 CONSTRUCTION RULE Each machine is built by attaching new blocks to the existing structure, starting from special root block. For convenience, we describe each construction step as an attacher block (child) connected to an attachee block (parent). As an attacher, each block has exactly one face available for connection; as an attachee, each block has none to several attachable faces. Once face is used, it is considered occupied and cannot be reused. If, after construction, the free end of block happens to coincide with an attachable face of an existing block, the two blocks are automatically connected. few special blocks violate the rule described above, such as spring. These blocks have two ends and thus must have two parent blocks, do not have physical volume can be attached to either vacant or occupied faces of other blocks. Finally, each block can be rescaled and rotated after construction. Since post-construction scaling and rotation introduce unnecessary complexity into our pipeline, we exclude them from our experiments and leave their handling to future work. B.2 SIMULATION Once constructed, the machine will be placed at the designated pose indicated by the position and orientation of the starting block (not necessary near the ground, but there is maximum height 2https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine) 3https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding"

Starting Block: the root of any mechanism; initial orientation is along z+ axis. Small Wooden Block: cubic basic construction block. Wooden Block: shaped like two small wooden blocks attached together. Wooden Rod: slender, fragile construction block. Log: shaped like three small wooden blocks arranged in parallel. Steering Hinge: powered; controls rotation of sub-blocks, swinging left or right along the axis perpendicular to its placement axis. Steering Block: powered; rotates blocks along its placement axis. Powered Wheel: radius 1m; provides ground movement. Unpowered Wheel: identical to the powered wheel but requires external force to rotate. Large Powered Wheel: larger version of the powered wheel (radius 3m). Large Unpowered Wheel: unpowered version of the large powered wheel. Small Wheel: functions like caster wheel (e.g., shopping cart), unpowered, 1.2m long. Roller Wheel: similar to the small wheel, but shorter (0.8m). Universal Joint: freely rotates around its placement axis, unpowered. Hinge: swings up and down along the axis perpendicular to its placement axis, unpowered. Ball Joint: swings freely in all directions, unpowered. Axle Connector: similar to ball joint but allows unrestricted 360 rotation. Suspension: shaped like wooden block, it can buffer forces from all directions. Rotating Block: powered; motor-like block that generates torque and rotates about its local y-axis."

Movement. Referred to as the car task in the main text, the objective is to build machine capable of driving along tracks and traversing various terrains. Throw. Referred to as the catapult task in the main text, the goal is to construct machine that can launch boulders over long distances. To prevent unintended strategies (e.g., carrying the boulder instead of throwing it, or letting it roll along the ground), the building area is enclosed by medium-height wall. Delivery. This task requires building machine that can transport large stone forward across different terrains  (Fig. 14)  . Pick. The objective here is to design machine that can retrieve stone located at the bottom of deep well  (Fig. 13)  . For many of these tasks, we introduce multiple difficulty levels (not used in the experiments reported in this paper) to encourage progressively more sophisticated designs: Movement and Delivery. We consider: (1) randomized terrains with stones and wooden rods (e.g., Fig. 11), (2) curved tracks  (Fig. 16)  , and (3) obstacles such as height-limiting bars. Throw. We design: (1) varied objectives, such as requiring the boulder to pass through an aerial ring  (Fig. 15)  or land precisely within small target zone, (2) environmental factors such as wind, and (3) obstacles, including height restrictions either within the building area or along the boulders trajectory."

For clarity, we refer to one consecutive querierrefiner call as search node (consistent with our MCTS setup). Unlike classical MCTS or best-of-N, here each search node is allowed up to five retries to prevent child statistics from being too sparse. We perform search rounds, each aiming to obtain 5 valid candidate machines (though this may fail; if fewer than 5 are found, the parent nodes machine is used as candidate). Full algorithmic details are provided in Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2, and Algorithm 3. In Fig. 9 we show the improvement of machine performance with respect to the number of search rounds used. In Fig. 17 we compare the efficiency of different search methods in our agentic compositional machine design setting.

            "content": "D.1 MACHINE REPRESENTATION To reduce complexity in compositional machine design, our machine representation assumes all blocks remain at their default scale and are not further rotated after attachment (note: the attachment operation itself may rotate blocks). D.2 GLOBAL POSITION-BASED REPRESENTATION By simplifying the default XML representation that BesiegeField receives, we obtain the global position-based representation. Below is concrete example: [ ] {\"type\": 0, \"Position\": [0,0, 0], \"Rotation\": [0,0,0,1]}, {\"type\": 1, \"Position\": [0,0,0.5], \"Rotation\": [0,0,0,1]}, {\"type\": 2, \"Position\": [0,0,2.5], \"Rotation\": [0,0,0,1]}, {\"type\": 9, \"Position\": [0,0.5,2], \"Rotation\": [-0.707,0,0,0.707], \"end-position\": [0,2,0]} Basically, each block in the machine is independently recorded without mentioning its adjacent blocks. For most of the block types, only the block type and its pose (position + orientation) are recorded. For special blocks that have two parents, the other end has to be specified, for which the corresponding dictionary has an additional entry of end-position. D.3 CONSTRUCTION TREE REPRESENTATION With our parsimonious construction tree representation, the example machine above is represented by the following the following JSON list: [ ] : -1}, {type: 0, id: 0, parent : -1, face_id 0}, : 0, face_id {type: 1, id: 1, parent : 0}, 1, face_id {type: 2, id: 2, parent : : 4, 0, face_id_a: {type: 9, id: 3, parent_a: 6} 1, face_id_b: parent_b: Specifically, the ordered list of dictionaries of the machine construction JSON file represents the construction order of blocks. Each dictionary contains the following information of corresponding block: 1) type: block type; 2) id: the order ID of this block (the same as the order in the list), included so that LLMs do not have to parse it by itself; 3) parent, the ID of its parent block; 4) face_id, the face of the blocks parent to which the block is attached. In cases that the block has two parents (e.g., string that connects both parts), we use parent_a and parent_b to record both parents; similar for face_id. Note: the first block with id 0 is always the unique starting block, of which the local position and rotation are always zero. D.4 REWARD SETTING Here we elaborate on the reward design for RL experiments in Sec. 5.1. Our reward is in the form of = is_validperformance where is_valid is the boolean representing machine validity and performance is the task-specific performance metric. Car. We set is_valid to 1 as long as the policy produces machine that can be parsed from the generated construction tree and can be successfully placed into the environment without any selfcollision; otherwise it is set to 0. performance is set to the distance between the starting position and the end position of the root block."

            "title": "Technical Report",
            "content": "Catapult. For is_valid to be 1 in this task, the machine has to satisfy an additional constraint compared to the car task: the maximum height of the boulder position during simulation must be greater than threshold of 3m. As explained in the main text, performance for catapult is the product of the maximum height and maximum distance (towards some pre-defined direction) during simulation. D.5 ENVIRONMENT FEEDBACK In principle, we are able to obtain all state variables of each single part of simulated machine. Due to the space complexity of the simulation results, not all information can be fed to LLM agents. Here we consider minimal set of environment feedback information that the environment querier always gathers and returns to the refiner. Below are the minimal set of feedback information for each task: Car. 1) machine orientation; 2) machine maximum moving distance (towards designated direction); 3) machine max speed; 4) machine average speed per second; 5) machine position per 0.2 second (atomic time). Catapult. 1) boulder maximum distance (horizontal, towards designated distance); 2) boulder maximum height; 3) boulder position per 0.2 second (atomic time). Beyond these basic pieces of feedback, the querier, after seeing the candidate machine and its simulation results, in our default setting selectively extract subset of environment feedback given its speculation on the issues of the simulated machine. For instance, parts during simulation may collide with each other and break. Such behavior carries important hints on why machines fail, and an LLM agent with sufficient capability in spatial and physics understanding can possibly identify the vulnerable blocks in the design. Below we elaborate on the additional information that the querier may gather: Block index to query; Time interval of interest (states outside this interval will not be considered); Feedback type of interest (one or more from the list) Position; Orientation; Velocity; Length (for spring only)"

As shown in Fig. 18, we observe several recurring categories of errors, including flawed reasoning, structural attachment errors, incorrect part orientations and failures in instruction following. These diverse failure types highlight both the reasoning and execution challenges inherent in compositional machine design. Figure 18: Examples to illustrate failure patterns. In each example, the original machine is shown on the left and the modified machine on the right. Failure patterns are sampled from Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct. E.2 NEED FOR PRECISION In Fig. 19 we present simple example to illustrate how the task of compositional machine design requires high precision in the spatial design of configurations of different parts. Even though the high-level design is feasible, the machine in the top row fails to throw the boulder out due to the incorrect position of the container. E.3 APPEARANCE VS. PERFORMANCE As illustrated in Fig. 20, machines appearance does not necessarily reflect its actual performance. design that seems well-aligned with human intuition can fail dramatically, while one that looks awkward or unintuitive may achieve superior results. For LLMs to design machines that are both effective and visually intuitive to humans, reward functions must account not only for task performance but also for stability and other factors that shape human perception of functionality."

We curated 100 design objectives: 75 captions of machines created by Besiege players from the Internet and 25 authored by us. These 25 prompts are constructed by 1) first writing down simple design objectives that are realizable by BesiegeField and can emerge from some simple rewards, and 2) then introducing environment constraints and machine-specific requirements. Using this prompt dataset, we generate 250 machines per prompt, and after filtering out inappropriate ones (those that fail to parse, cannot be built in the environment, or do not have specific physics-driven functionality, e.g., statue), we obtain 9,984 machines with their corresponding CoT. sample gallery is shown in Fig. 21. We present examples in the curated prompt set: 1. Build machine that can provide an exciting spinning amusement ride experience. 2. Build machine that can mimic the movements of humanoid figure for entertainment or functional demonstrations. 3. Build machine that can glide smoothly over snow or ice. Below we present the text prompts with our simple authoring strategy, which can possibly be scaled with LLMs: -Additional Environment Constraints1. On an uneven, bumpy straight road, build small car that must travel in straight line to the finish. 2. On straight road stands stone wall; build battering ram that must accelerate straight ahead, smash the wall, and finish with minimal damage to the machine. -Modified Demands for Target Machines1. Build tall tower that must keep heavy block (id 36) at 15 height for 5 without collapse. 2. On straight road stands 10 high wall; build siege ladder that must advance, extend its top above the wall, and remain upright throughout. F.2 COLD-START DETAILS In our experiment, we use Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct as the base model and train it on the Gemini synthesized dataset. To save GPU memory, we employ the parameter-efficient quantized OFT (QOFT) technique (Qiu et al., 2025c; 2023; Liu et al., 2024a; Qiu et al., 2025a) for updating the model parameters, with OFT block size 64. We use 8-bit training with the 8-bit AdamW optimizer implmented with bitsandbytes (Dettmers et al., 2022), learning rate of 1e-6 and linear warmup schedule (3% of the total training steps). F.3 RL EXPERIMENT DETAILS We use verl framework to implement our RL experiments. The LLM is finetuned from Qwen2.514B-Instruct (with LoRA of rank 64 on all linear layers) using the Gemini-synthesized dataset described above. We set learning rate to 5e-6 with gradient clipping threshold set to 0.5. The GRPO advantage estimator uses an advantage clipping ratio of 0.2. We add KL penalty (weight 0.001) with respect to the pretrained LLM and do not introduce any entropy regularization. For rollouts, we use temperature of 1.0 and top-p value of 0.95. Maximum input and output lengths are 3440 and 1168 tokens, respectively. We train each model for 400 update steps which take approximately 48 hours."

Leveraging the knowledge on existing machines, meta-designers can identify the key macro-level mechanical components that are easier to design compared to the whole task, as shown in the results for Gemini 2.5 Pro, Kimi K2 and Llama 4 Scout. However, introducing an additional stage can introduce compounding error and, if the LLM agent is not capable of integrating different macro-level mechanical components, they may lead to lower scores, which we hypothesize is the reason for the failure of hierarchical design in models like Qwen3. Moreover, we examine if the meta-designer should provide step-by-step building instruction for the designer  (Fig. 22)  , or simply provide high-level mechanical component descriptions. We find that meta-designer that provides more detailed information is beneficial mostly when the base model is powerful enough (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro). Effect of feedback-free self-critic. In Table 11, we show that the inspector agent which does selfcritic before running any environment simulation tend to improve performance for models like Gemini 2.5 Pro (the most powerful model for the task of compositional machine design in BesiegeField) but can fail drastically for models like o3.

Its orientation is y+ (upwards). This placement and orientation are rational, as it correctly positions it to hold the Boulder [13] like cup at the end of the throwing arm. * **Boulder [13]**: It is placed inside the Container [12] with its center at [1.0, 7.4, -2.0]. As the projectile, its placement is logical and necessary for the machines function. 3. **Balance Check (self-gravity):** a. **Center of Gravity**: The calculated center of gravity for the entire machine is approximately at (0.85, 4.22, -1.46). The block closest to this point is the Log [11]. b. **Sinking/Collapse**: Yes, parts of the machine will collapse. The entire throwing mechanism, including the heavy Boulder [13] (mass 5), rests on tall, slender support tower made of single Wooden Blocks ([6], [7], [8]). This structure is extremely fragile and not braced. The machine is severely top-heavy, and the immense weight concentrated on this single tower will cause it to bend and collapse under gravity alone, even before the Rotating Block [10] is activated. 4. **Comprehensive Analysis:** a. **Force Summary**: The primary force is gravity, which makes the top-heavy machine highly unstable due to the high position of the Boulder [13]. Upon activation, the Rotating Block [10] will generate massive torque on the throwing arm and an equal reaction torque on the flimsy support tower. The combination of static top-heaviness and dynamic reaction forces will lead to immediate structural failure. b. **Logically Unreasonable Blocks**: Block [6] -> Wooden Block [7] -> Wooden Block [8]. **Hierarchical Structure**: Starting Block [0] -> Wooden **Reason for Unreasonableness**: The support tower consisting * * of blocks [6], [7], and [8] is fundamentally flawed. It is single, unbraced column tasked with supporting the entire throwing arm and the heavy Boulder [13]. This design is far too weak to handle the static weight, let alone the powerful dynamic forces and reaction torque from the Rotating Block [10]. The machine is guaranteed to collapse. </Question Answer> <Summary of Design Defects> 1. Problem description, involving blocks: [6, 7, 8], belonging to structure: \"Base and Support Frame\" The support tower for the throwing mechanism, composed of blocks [6], [7], and [8], is critically weak. It is single, unbraced column made of wooden blocks, which is completely inadequate to support the massive weight of the throwing arm and the Boulder [13]. The structure will collapse under its own weight or instantly shatter upon activation of the Rotating Block [10] due to the immense reaction torque. </Summary of Design Defects> J.5 ENVIRONMENT QUERIER system: <System Prompt> environment-querier input: Task Introduction Construct machine that can throw boulders in parabolic trajectory, designed to maximize throw distance and height by utilizing the principle of leverage."

Analysis of the Machine and Failure:** **Machine Structure:** The machine consists of base, vertical * tower on the right side, and rotating arm mounted on top of the tower. The arm has container with boulder on one end and was intended to have counterweight on the other. Power is provided by Rotating Block (ID 10) at the pivot and Ballast (ID 14) acting as counterweight. Two Rubber Bands (ID 15, 16) are connected from the top of the tower ( **Failure Mode:** The simulation feedback consistently reports that ID 8) to the base, seemingly for stabilization. * DoubleWoodenBlock id:8 is damaged at 0.4 seconds. Block 8 is the topmost block of the support tower, directly holding the entire rotating assembly (Rotating Block, arm, boulder, and ballast). * **Overwhelming Force:** The combination of the Rotating Blocks **Root Cause Analysis:** * torque and the heavy Ballast (ID 14, mass 3) dropping creates an immense rotational force. The Boulder (ID 13, mass 5) at the end of long lever arm (ID 11, Log) amplifies this stress. The tower, constructed from simple Wooden Blocks, cannot withstand this force, leading to the failure of block 8. * **Instability:** The feedback shows the entire machine lifting and tilting (machine orientation in long time x-, machine frequently changes in the following orientations). This indicates the base is too small and light to counteract the violent motion of the throwing arm. The Rubber Bands (ID 15, 16) are connected asymmetrically (from the tower to the front and left parts of the base), which likely introduces twisting force, contributing to the instability and structural failure rather than preventing it. **2. Modification Strategy:** The primary goal is to ensure the machines structural integrity so it can actually launch the boulder without self-destructing. * **Step 1: Reduce Destructive Forces.** The most critical issue is the excessive force breaking block 8. The simplest way to address this is to remove the primary source of this force, the Ballast (ID 14). The Rotating Block (ID 10) by itself will still provide sufficient power to launch the boulder, but with much less violent acceleration, which the wooden structure should be able to handle. * and 16) are not stabilizing the structure effectively and are likely contributing to the twisting failure due to their asymmetric placement. **Step 2: Remove Ineffective Components.** The Rubber Bands (ID"

Please gain general understanding of the game based on the following information: I. Game Introduction: 1. Besiege is physics-based construction game developed using Unity. Players need to build various machines to complete different tasks. 2. Besiege only contains basic mechanics and physical laws, such as mass, friction, and collision. 3. Blocks are used to build machines. Each block has its unique functions , advantages, and disadvantages. II. Block Introduction: 1. Blocks are mainly divided into five major categories: Basic Blocks, Mobility Blocks, Mechanical Blocks, Weapon Blocks, and Armor Blocks. - Basic Blocks are the fundamental components of many machines - structural blocks and some basic moving parts. - Mobility Blocks are primarily designed for movement functions - powered and unpowered wheels, steering blocks, and gears. - Mechanical Blocks provide various useful auxiliary functions - joints, suspension devices, winches, grabbers, etc. - Weapon Blocks offer various types of violent output at different ranges - swords and saws for close combat, and cannons and rockets for longrange. - Armor Blocks can protect the machine from damage or provide useful shapes for carrying other blocks - armor plates and wooden panels, as well as half-pipes and brackets. 2. Here is detailed introduction to the properties and functions of each block: Name Category Type ID Function ----------------------------------- Starting Block Basic 0 The Starting Block is the root block of the machine; it is placed at the starting position by default, cannot be moved, cannot be deleted, and only one can exist at time. Small Wooden Block Basic 15 basic structural block, cube-shaped , to which other blocks can be attached from any side, making it particularly suitable for constructing the basic framework of machines."

            "content": "Wooden Block Basic 1 basic mechanical block, twice the length of Small Wooden Block. Wooden Rod Basic 41 basic mechanical block, twice the length of Small Wooden Block, with the same weight as Wooden Block, but very fragile. Log Basic 63 basic mechanical block, more robust, three times the length of Small Wooden Block. Brace Basic 7 non-placeable block used for reinforcement, built by \"attaching\" to other blocks, with no collision volume. It is often used to increase the stability of static structures and is not suitable for any dynamic structures. Steering Hinge Mobility 28 The Steering Hinge can rotate blocks along an axis perpendicular to the placement axis. This block can rotate child blocks to 180-degree direction to the left or right, commonly used for vehicle steering. Steering Block Mobility 13 The Steering Block can rotate blocks along its placement axis, similar to the rotating part of helicopters rotor. Powered Wheel Mobility 2 Similar to car wheel, it can drive itself but cannot turn independently. It is mechanical device used for moving objects on the ground. Unpowered Wheel Mobility 40 wheel that does not rotate without external force, otherwise similar to Powered Wheel. Powered Large Wheel Mobility 46 Similar to Powered Wheel, but with radius and thickness twice that of Powered Wheel. Unpowered Large Wheel Mobility without external force, otherwise similar to Powered Large Wheel. Small Wheel Mobility 50 It works almost the same as caster wheel (like shopping cart wheel), unpowered. Universal Joint Mechanical 19 block that can freely rotate around its placement axis, similar to Steering Block but without power. wheel that does not rotate Hinge Mechanical 5 Similar to Steering Hinge, but without power . Ball Joint Mechanical 44 Can swing 360 degrees along the axis perpendicular to the placement axis, but without power. Axle Connector Mechanical 76 Similar to Ball Joint. Rotating Block Mechanical 22 Powered, it can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise along the axis perpendicular to the placement axis. Suspension Mechanical 16 Shaped like wooden block, it can buffer forces from all directions. Grabber Mechanical 27 It will grab and hold onto any object it comes into contact with. Spring Mechanical 9 special block that attaches to two other blocks and can quickly pull them together. Its pulling force is almost entirely dependent on its length. Boulder Weapon 36 stone that does not directly connect to other blocks even when built on them. It can be used as projectile weapon and is also commonly used as target in transportation tests. Elastic Pad Armor 87 Increases the elasticity of the contact surface, providing an effect of rebounding and increasing kinetic energy. Container Armor 30 Can hold child blocks like bowl, mainly used to carry blocks that cannot be directly connected to the machine. The container has some anti-slip capability, and only one block (the target to be carried) can be placed inside. No other blocks can be added. Roller Wheel Locomotion 86 Similar to the small wheel, but shorter (0.8m). Grip Pad Armour 49 Block with the highest friction. Ballast Flight 35 heavy cubic block used as counterweight. III. Mechanical Design Requirements: 1. When designing the machine, you should adopt \"layered design\" approach. Break down the users requirements into the functions that the machine needs to achieve, and list the functional points."

Block Information Format Each blocks information follows the dict format. Attributes that block does not have will not appear in the keys. 1. Characteristic Tags: a. Non-static: The block can actively generate force or movement. b. Non-stable: The connection between the block and its parent block is non-rigid, allowing for movement or rotation. c. Linear: The block is used to connect two existing points rather than being attached to single point. If there are no tags, it is regular static and stable block. 2. Attachable Faces: The key is in the format of attachable face ID, coordinates (relative coordinates), and orientation (relative orientation). II. Key Special Rules 1. Powered Wheel Rule (applicable to all powered wheels): The direction of power provided by the wheel is not the same as its orientation. - Forward (Z+ direction): The wheel should face sideways (X+ or X-). - Left turn (power pushes towards X-): The wheel should face forward ( Z+). - Right turn (power pushes towards X+): The wheel should face backward (Z-)."
