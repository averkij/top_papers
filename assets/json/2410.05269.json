            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Data serves as crucial element in the alignment of large language models (LLMs), as data quality and coverage profoundly impact the utility and safety of LLMs (Wang et al., 2023a; Ouyang et al., 2022; Köpf et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2023; Conover et al., 2023). Since human annotation is costly and does not scale easily, recent studies have utilized LLMs to produce new datasets (Wang et al., 2023b; Yuan et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023b; Honovich et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023a; Mehrabi et al., 2023), with the main human involvement being the provision of small set of seed data as in-context examples. Although LLM-generated data can readily scale, it often suffers from known quality issues (Chen et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Previous methods typically generate new data via incontext learning (Wang et al., 2023b; Yuan et al., 2024), without considering dataset-level properties (e.g., coverage and diversity). Without additional guidance, the data generator is unaware of the overall dataset statistics, which can lead to the omission of specific aspects and the amplification of its own biases over iterations (Das et al., 2024; Chung et al., 2023; Felkner et al., 2024). Thus, the generated data can fail to align LLMs with diverse goals, such as addressing fine-grained safety issues (Bhardwaj et al., 2024; Inan et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023). Moreover, some issues can manifest as low-quality datapoints, such as ambiguous or redundant questions. Although filtering out and refining low-quality data is possible (Chen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Parkar et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2022b), the postprocessing pipelines lead to notable reduction in preserved data. For instance, Alpagasus (Chen et al., 2023) noted that 83% of Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) data should be discarded due to its detrimental impact on LLM alignment. These observations underscore the significance of proactively generating expected data, direction that remains under-explored in existing literature. In this paper, we propose DATA ADVISOR, which enhances LLM-based data generation by dynamically and proactively incorporating guiding principles of the target dataset (for safety alignment).1 DATA ADVISOR instructs the data generator to create alignment data with predefined principles, involving both quality and directional control of an independent prompt, as well as the overall statistics of the dataset. With set of principles in hand, DATA ADVISOR monitors the status of the generated data, identifies weaknesses in the current dataset, and advises the next iteration of 1While we use safety alignment as the primary testbed, DATA ADVISOR can be applied to dynamic data curation in broader scenarios, such as instruction tuning, preference optimization, and domain adaptation. 4 2 0 2 ] .

Guided by set of constitutional principles, DATA ADVISOR monitors the generated data (top right), identifies weaknesses in the current dataset (top center), and provides advice for the next iteration of data generation (top left). data generation accordingly. At the monitor stage, it summarizes the current dataset iteratively, with the last data summary and the newly generated instance as input. At the advise stage, it identifies the current data weaknesses based on the summary, which is sent to the data generator later to guide the generation of the next instance. DATA ADVISOR can be easily integrated into existing data generation methods, such as Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023b; Yuan et al., 2024), to enhance data quality and coverage. To verify the effectiveness of DATA ADVISOR, we conduct experiments on the safety alignment of LLMs. One of the primary challenges in safety alignment is ensuring comprehensive coverage of diverse safety issues (Bhardwaj et al., 2024; Inan et al., 2023). To address this, DATA ADVISOR prioritizes the coverage of safety issues, guiding the data generator to produce data that targets missing or underrepresented safety concerns in each iteration. We generated 10K safety alignment datapoints using DATA ADVISOR, encompassing wide range of fine-grained safety issues. By integrating the generated data with additional instruction tuning datasets, such as Alpagasus, we create balanced training set. We then train three base LLMs (i.e., Mistral, Llama2, and Falcon) using this mixture of safety alignment and instruction tuning data. The aligned models demonstrate improved safety across diverse issues without compromising overall model utility compared with the predominant data generation methods like Self-Instruct. Our contributions are three fold. First, we propose DATA ADVISOR, an LLM-based data generation method that dynamically and proactively incorporates the guiding principles of the target dataset. Equipped with dataset-level guidelines, DATA ADVISOR achieves improved data quality and coverage, thereby enhancing LLM alignment. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DATA ADVISOR in improving safety alignment without compromising overall model utility. Third, we release the generated safety alignment dataset, which covers wide range of fine-grained safety issues, to support future research."

            "content": "LLMs have demonstrated advanced capabilities in instruction following (Zhang et al., 2023) and incontext learning (Brown et al., 2020). Building upon these capabilities, recent studies have applied LLMs to generate data automatically for further training themselves or other LLMs, reducing the need for extensive human annotation (Wang et al., 2023b; Yuan et al., 2024). As shown in the bottom of Fig. 1, the typical data generation process begins with set of seed data serving as the exemplar pool. This process is performed iteratively. In each iteration, the data generator (i.e., an LLM) samples multiple exemplars from the pool. These exemplars are then filled into prompt template and sent to the data generator to produce new data via in-context learning. The newly generated data is subsequently added back to the exemplar pool, marking the end of one iteration. The final dataset is used to train the target LLM, enhancing its capabilities. Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023b) is one of the prominent LLM-based data generation methods. It uses the target LLM itself as the data generator, generating paired prompts and responses in each iteration. In the context of safety alignment, prompts for training should cover diverse safety issues, while responses require careful safety consideration. Thus, following Yuan et al. (2024), we generate prompts and responses separately to meet their distinct requirements. Specifically, we use an independent safety-aligned LLM to provide safe responses to the generated prompts. As another general setting in this paper, we assume that the target LLM is unknown in order to demonstrate the generalizability of the generated data. Therefore, we use an independent LLM as the data generator and validate the effectiveness of the generated data on different target LLMs. For simplicity, we retain the name Self-Instruct for the baseline throughout the rest of the paper. In the typical data generation process described above, while the LLMs used as data generators play crucial role in the quality of individual prompts and responses, they have limited control over the overall data generation process. The properties of the generated data are primarily determined by the initial seed data and the prompts used for data generation. Without additional guidance, the data generator is unaware of the overall dataset statistics, can overlook important data properties, and may produce unsatisfactory generated data. data generation accordingly. These principles for data generation specify the purpose of the dataset, key properties to focus on, and additional requirements throughout the generation process. These principles are in the same spirit as collecting human supervision based on set of guidelines to govern AI behavior, akin to the concept of Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022b). They can vary depending on the application scenarios. We leave further discussion of data generation principles in different scenarios to applied researchers and legal experts. In the following paragraphs, we use diversity and coverage of safety issues as example principles to introduce the details of the method. Data Summarization. Initially, given the existing data, DATA ADVISOR generates concise report about the data properties, including the distribution of data across various perspectives. This step is formulated as query-focused summarization. The principles (such as topics and domains to cover) for guiding the generation of expected data are converted into meta-summary and provided to DATA ADVISOR as prompt. The detailed prompt template for this step is shown in Appx. A. The advisor then completes the report based on the existing data. However, as the dataset size could continuously expand, it becomes impractical to provide all data to the advisor as holistic prompt every time. Therefore, we adopt an iterative approach to updating the summary. In each iteration, the advisor receives the newly generated data point along with the previous summary as input. At the outset, we query the advisor to summarize the seed data from scratch without any previous summary available. This iterative process allows for more efficient and scalable monitoring of the datasets properties and evolution. The typical prompt template for this step is shown as follows, with detailed version in Appx. A."

In safety alignment, DATA ADVISOR initializes the data summary with the fine-grained safety issues contained in the seed data. For example, the seed data covers self-harm, violence, and illegal activities. Then, when new data point is generated and added to the dataset, DATA ADVISOR updates this summary by adding the safety issue (e.g., privacy violation) of the new data point. Identification. Data Weakness Next, DATA ADVISOR data weaknesses identifies according to the data summary and the predefined principles. Each iteration, the data advisor is prompted to discern specific weakness. We provide the data summary along with data generation principles as prompt to the data advisor. The detailed prompt template for this step is shown in Appx. A. By translating the summary into actionable insights, the DATA ADVISOR enables the data generator to focus on addressing specific weaknesses afterwards, thereby facilitating the iterative improvement of the generated data.

Weakness Idenfication Prompt Template {Guiding Principles} {Data Summary} {New Weaknesses} This step is visualized as the top middle part of Fig. 1. For safety alignment, the data generation principles instruct the data advisor to prioritize the diversity and coverage of safety issues. This ensures that the generated dataset encompasses broad spectrum of safety concerns, thereby enhancing the models ability to address various safetyrelated challenges effectively. Given the data summary from the last step, DATA ADVISOR may identify that cyberbullying is underrepresented in the existing data. Data Generation with Advice. Finally, DATA ADVISOR generates the new data point targeting the identified weakness. This step is formulated as controlled generation. The weakness is converted into prompt, which is then forwarded to the data generator, providing guidance for the generation of the next data point. In this way, standard data generation is combined with control signals, guiding the generator to focus on specific aspects to fulfill specific goals. As result, the newly generated data can enhance the overall quality of the dataset. This iterative process ensures that the dataset remains diverse, relevant, and aligned with the desired objectives.

Data Generation Prompt Template {In-context Examples} {Data Weakness} {New Instance} This step is visualized as the top left part of Fig. 1.

            "title": "4 Experiment",
            "content": "In this section, we first introduce the experimental setup (4.1), with particular focus on the evaluation of safety and utility. This is followed by the presentation of the main results on three representative LLMs (4.2). Finally, we provide detailed analyses of fine-grained model performance, data diversity, data mixture, and qualitative results (4.3). 4.1 Experimental Setup Evaluation Protocol. We evaluate the quality of the LLM-generated data by assessing how well LLMs perform after finetuned on the data. Following previous works (Ge et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), we finetune base LLMs with mixture of safety alignment data and additional instructiontuning data to balance the models safety and utility. Then, we evaluate the models safety by prompting the finetuned LLMs with harmful questions and evaluate the harmful rate of their responses. We also evaluate the models utility on multitask language understanding benchmark. Evaluation Datasets. For safety evaluation, we use two harmful question datasets with detailed harmful categories designed for evaluating finegrained LLM safety. CatQA (Bhardwaj et al., 2024) consists of 550 harmful questions evenly distributed on 11 categories, where each category have five sub-categories. Fig. 3 presents all the categories, such as economic harm and malware viruses. BeaverTails (Ji et al., 2023) has 700 harmful questions covering 14 harm categories, such as adult content and child abuse. Fig. 4 presents all the categories. For utility evaluation, we use MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), multitask language understanding benchmark that is widely used to evaluate the utility of LLMs. Specifically, we use the validation set consisting of 1,530 multiple-choice Figure 2: Safety and utility of models trained with different data with Mistral (left), Llama2 (middle), and Falcon (right) as base models. Models trained with DATA ADVISOR achieves better safety without hurting utility. questions, ranging from elementary mathematics to extensive world knowledge. Evaluation Metrics. Following Zhou et al. (2024), we use LlamaGuard (Inan et al., 2023) as an automatic evaluation metric. LlamaGuard can classify each prompt-response pair into safe or unsafe. We report the ratio of safe responses as safety score and the ratio of unsafe responses as harmful rate on each dataeset. For MMLU, we report the average accuracy as the utility score. Base Models. We conduct experiments on three representative LLMs. Mistral-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2023) is pretrained language model released under the Apache 2.0 license. Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023) is pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of public data. Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023) is trained on 1,500B tokens of RefinedWeb (Penedo et al., 2023) and is released under the Apache 2.0 license. For all the three models, we use the base version of 7 billion parameters without instruction tuning and safety alignment. Baseline. We compare DATA ADVISOR with the widely used LLM-based data generation method, Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2023b). Starting from small set of seed data, it generates new data with in-context learning. After each iteration of data generation, the candidate pool of in-context examples is updated and enlarged. Self-Instruct is originally proposed to generate instructions, inputs, and outputs at the same time. We follow Yuan et al. (2024) to generate 10K prompts independently for safety alignment. Implementation Details. For both Self-Instruct and DATA ADVISOR, we use Mistral-7B-Instructv0.2 as the data generator. We use safety-aligned LLM (i.e., Llama2-Chat-7B) to pair each prompt with safe response. For DATA ADVISOR, we randomly sample three in-context examples for 10 times in each iteration and generate 10 prompts Figure 3: Harmful rate by category on CatQA for Mistral-based models (top), Llama2-based models (middle), and Falcon-based models (bottom). in one batch for efficiency. For Self-Instruct, we randomly sample five in-context examples each time. During training, we combine the generated safety alignment data with 9K instruction tuning data from Alpagasus, resulting in roughly balanced training set for aligning to helpfulness and harmlessness objectives. For all models, we adopt LoRA tuning (Hu et al., 2021) with rank set to 32 and α set to 16. We use batch size of 32 and learning rate of 0.00002. During inference, we use vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) to improve throughput for efficiency. The decoding temperature is set to 0 and the max number of tokens to generate is set to 128. 4.2 Main Results Fig. 2 presents the safety and utility metrics of three models before and after training with LLMFigure 4: Harmful rate by category on BeaverTails for Mistral-based models (top), Llama2-based models (middle), and Falcon-based models (bottom). generated safety alignment data. Both Self-Instruct and DATA ADVISOR improve model safety on CatQA and BeaverTails across different base models. On CatQA, all base models initially achieve safety scores ranging from 26.4 to 47.3, while Self-Instruct and DATA ADVISOR result in average improvements of 41.5 and 51.6, respectively. On BeaverTails, all base models initially achieve safety scores between 50.7 and 57.0, with Self-Instruct and DATA ADVISOR yielding average improvements of 26.7 and 31.3, respectively. DATA ADVISOR consistently outperforms SelfInstruct in terms of both safety and utility across all base models. On average, DATA ADVISOR achieves +10.1 increase in safety scores on CatQA, +4.6 increase on BeaverTails, and +1.6 increase in utility scores on MMLU compared to Self-Instruct. These results indicate the effectiveness of DATA ADVISOR in generating safety alignment data. They also demonstrate that the data generated by DATA ADVISOR is effective across different base LLMs. 4.3 Analysis on all harmful categories. We further analyze the fine-grained results by harmful category. Fig. 3 shows the results by category on CatQA. DATA ADVISOR achieves better or comparable harmful rates across all categories, with the rates for Adult Content, Child Abuse, Hate/Harass/Violence, and Tailored Financial Advice dropping to zero, whereas Self-Instruct may generate harmful responses across all categories. The category where DATA ADVISOR outperforms Self-Instruct the most is Economic Harm, with performance gap of 24%. This is followed by Adult Content, Child Abuse, and Illegal Activity, each with performance gap of 20%. Fig. 4 shows the results on BeaverTails. Similarly, DATA ADVISOR achieves lower harmful rates across all categories compared to Self-Instruct. The largest performance gap appears in the categories of organized crime and terrorism, where DATA ADVISOR reduces harmful rates by an additional 28%. Following this, DATA ADVISOR outperforms Self-Instruct in aiding and abetting, incitement, and violence by 22%. We provide detailed analyses from four perspectives: results on fine-grained safety issues, data diversity, the effect of data mixture, and qualitative results of data generated by DATA ADVISOR. DATA ADVISOR improves model performance DATA ADVISOR can improve data diversity. To evaluate data diversity, we measure the ratio of distinct n-grams (Li et al., 2016) in prompts from both LLM-generated safety alignment data and human-annotated evaluation data. As shown in Fig. 5, the evaluation data, which is carefully cuFigure 5: Ratio of distinct n-grams for all prompts in LLM-generated safety alignment data and humanannotated evaluation data. The x-axis represents different values of n. rated by humans and includes diverse categories of safety issues, exhibits higher ratios of distinct n-grams. This finding indicates correlation between the ratio of distinct n-grams and the quality and diversity of safety alignment data. For LLMgenerated data, DATA ADVISOR achieves much higher ratios of distinct n-grams across different compared to Self-Instruct. The gap between the two methods grows larger, reaching up to 50% as increases. Notably, the distinct 8-gram ratio of DATA ADVISOR surpasses that of the humancurated CatQA, reaching 91.8%. In contrast, SelfInstruct never exceeds 42%. Mixture of safety alignment and instruction tuning data is necessary. Fig. 6 shows the performance of Mistral-based models trained with different alignment data. The results suggest that both the safety alignment data generated by DATA ADVISOR and the instruction tuning data from Alpagasus are essential for balanced performance. Without training data targeting safety, model performance on CatQA and BeaverTails drops by 51.5% and 23.0%, respectively. Conversely, without training data targeting utility, although model safety can exceed 99%, utility drops by 16.9%, which is worse than the base model before training. Combining both types of data balances the safety and utility of the aligned model, resulting in model that is both safer and more helpful. Notably, the models utility after training with the mixture of data is better than when trained with Alpagasus data alone. Correctness of Intermediate Outputs. We further analyze the quality of summarization and weakness identification in each iteration. The summaries and weaknesses are presented in structured format. We extract the updated part in each iteration and Figure 6: Ablation on training data. Both safety alignment data and utility alignment data are essential. check their quality. For summaries, we assess if the newly added weaknesses are not included or if partial content from the last summary is missing. Overall, 84% of the summaries are updated accurately. For weaknesses, we assess if they introduce new safety issues not identified in prior iterations by comparing key words. Overall, 75% of the weaknesses introduce new safety issues. Notably, this ratio does not change significantly as the iterations increase. In the first 500 iterations, the summary accuracy is 85% and the weakness accuracy is 77%. In the last 500 iterations, the summary accuracy is 83% and the weakness accuracy is 71%. We argue that the data advisor is noise-tolerant. Even if no weakness is identified in an iteration, the data advisor can still benefit from the more diverse exemplar pool accumulated in prior iterations and generate more diverse data than Self-Instruct. As we use highly structured summary and weakness format which only requires minimal updates each iteration, future work can improve the stability of summarization with rule checks and correct the errors based on the feedback of the checker. Qualitative Results. We present examples of prompts with safety concerns generated by DATA ADVISOR in Tab. 1. These prompts are distributed throughout the generation iterations, covering diverse categories of safety issues. We observe that DATA ADVISOR can identify underrepresented or missing safety issues in the existing data and suggest new directions for the next iteration of data generation. The capabilities of identifying weaknesses and advising new directions do not degrade with iterations. Even around iteration 1,000, DATA ADVISOR continues to propose new safety issues (e.g., Moral Dilemma Inducing), thereby increasing data diversity. Some of the generated safety issues are rarely explored in previous datasets, such as challenges to personal beliefs, threats to linguistic diversity, and moral dilemmas.

            "content": "In this section, we briefly review two relevant research directions. 5.1 LLM-based Data Curation The landscape of data curation with LLMs has seen significant advancements recently. In terms of instruction tuning data generation, Wang et al. (2023b) introduce Self-Instruct, where LLMs generate instruction-following data. Yuan et al. (2024) follow the Self-Instruct method to iteratively generate data and updating the LLM. Other works, such as Taori et al. (2023), explore using strong LLM like GPT-4 to generate complex instructions. Instruction Backtranslation (Li et al., 2023) augments and curates training data by backtranslating between instructions and responses. Prior work has also explored generating preference data with LLMs (Lee et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). In addition to data generation, another line of work investigates data cleaning with LLMs. Chen et al. (2023) use advanced LLMs to assess the quality of generated data. Bai et al. (2022b) prompt LLMs to refine the generated data. These works collectively contribute to the enhancement of data curation capabilities in LLMs. However, the proactive generation of datasets with targeted properties remains underexplored, which is the focus of our paper. 5.2 Safety Alignment The increasing prominence of LLMs has underscored the critical importance of enhancing their safety and reliability (Touvron et al., 2023; Inan et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address safety concerns, notably during the phases of supervised fine-tuning, instruction tuning, and preference alignment (Bai et al., 2022a; Ge et al., 2023). Among these techniques, commonly employed approach involves LLMs with safety alignment data, which aims to ensure that the models adhere to ethical guidelines and avoid generating harmful content (Ouyang et al., 2022). Despite these efforts, recent studies have highlighted persistent issues of misalignment, where LLMs may unintentionally produce unsafe or biased outputs, thereby compromising their reliability and trustworthiness (Bhardwaj et al., 2024; Ji et al., 2023). This underscores the need for safety alignment data of higher quality with better coverage and diversity to address real-world issues, ensuring that LLMs can effectively align with human values and societal norms."

Further analyses show that DATA ADVISOR exhibits better data diversity than Self-Instruct, and its ability to identify dataset weaknesses does not degrade with iterations of data generation. Future work can extend DATA ADVISOR to other scenarios, such as mitigating backdoor in instruction tuning data (Xu et al., 2024), preventing data bias in preference optimization (Wang et al., 2024b), and integrating constraints for task adaptation (Wang et al., 2024a)."

            "content": "While we have conducted comprehensive experiments on safety alignment to demonstrate the effectiveness of DATA ADVISOR, there are still several limitations. First, applying DATA ADVISOR to generate other types of data, such as instruction tuning data, remains unexplored. Future work could investigate the potential of DATA ADVISOR in these areas to further validate its versatility and efficacy. Second, the scale of our experiments is limited to 7B models and dataset size of 10K. Larger-scale experiments involving bigger models and more extensive datasets could provide additional insights into the robustness and scalability of DATA ADVISOR. Third, there are multiple choices for some components in DATA ADVISOR, but we have only experimented with subset of these options. Exploring wider range of configurations and parameters could uncover more optimal settings and enhance the overall performance of DATA ADVISOR.

            "content": "We recognize that LLMs, if not properly trained, can inadvertently produce responses that are biased, offensive, or otherwise harmful. Our experiments focus on mitigating unethical responses from LLMs. To achieve this goal, our method generates prompts that cover wide range of realworld scenarios that may have ethical concerns. While one could respond with harmful information, our dataset contains only harmless responses. The dataset is intended to be used to enhance the harmlessness of LLMs."
