            "content": "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly bifurcated. On one side are general-purpose conversational agents; on the other are models specialized for deliberate, multi-step computation (Ornia et al., 2025). This specialization is frequently driven by training paradigms that heavily penalize incorrect answers and reward valid reasoning chains, effectively optimizing the model to be robust computational engine. While this maximizes performance on static benchmarks, real-world deployment requires objective prioritization. An agent must not only possess the capability to solve task but also the discernment to determine if task should be solved given the surrounding context (Wang and Zhong, 2023). Standard alignment techniques typically focus on refusing harmful requests (e.g., generating dangerous content). In this work, we investigate the inverse: harmful neglect. We ask whether models can identify when benign request (solving an equation) becomes inappropriate due to the users physical state (e.g., Solve this integral while bleed out). We introduce MortalMATH, targeted evaluation set that wraps standard difficult MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) algebra problems in conversational contexts of escalating urgency. By analyzing the behaviors of six diverse models, we identify distinct behavioral split. Unlike generalist models, which tend to pivot to safety warnings, reasoning-dense models often treat the urgency cues as irrelevant noise. They prioritize the reward signal of the math solution, leading to responses where model provides perfect derivation of polynomial while the user describes symptoms of stroke. This behavior suggests form of consequence blindness (Wu et al., 2025), where the immediate reward of task completion obscures the broader pragmatic failure. The code and data are publicly available1."

We explore the inverse: models that are too helpful, failing to stop benign tasks when safety demands it. Ying et al. (2024) categorize LLM decision-making into intuitive vs. rational styles when facing conflicting prompts. In our setup, the conflict is between the explicit instruction (do the math) and the implicit context (I am dying). Consequence and Affordance Awareness. Our findings align with the concept of consequence blindness introduced by Wu et al. (2025), where models fail to map surface semantics to outcome Similarly, Adak et al. (2025) discuss risks. 1 Colab notebook HuggingFace dataset affordance-aware alignment (AURA), arguing that models must identify unsafe procedural trajectories. We show that for reasoning models, the \"trajectory\" of solving math problem is so strongly reinforced ignores the \"affordance\" of the users it that mortality. Rewards and Latency.

(2025) highlight how process rewards can overfit to specific behaviors (like step-by-step the expense of broader utility. derivation) at Furthermore, Xu et al. (2025) (Chain of Draft) emphasize that reasoning latency is critical factor in usability. We extend this to safety: in Level 4/5 scenarios, the 10-15 seconds spent generating math tokens represents dangerous delay in triage."

            "content": "MortalMATH acts as diagnostic probe to evaluate the conflict between two objectives: (1) Instruction Adherence (solving the users explicit math query) and (2) Contextual Safety (addressing the users implicit physical danger). 3.1 Dataset Construction and Rationalization We utilize 10 randomly selected Algebra problems (difficulty 4) from the Competition MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021). These problems require significant cognitive processing, distinguishing them from trivial arithmetic. We inject these problems into prompt template (c,p), where is the problem and is context describing the users state. The \"Anyway\" Pivot. To rigorously test context retention, we employ strong discourse pivot: Anyway, can you help me with this assignment:. While this artificially separates context, robust alignment requires maintaining awareness of safety states (e.g., am dying) regardless of discourse markers, much like doctor tracking symptoms even if patient changes the topic. 3.2 The Urgency Spectrum We define five levels of urgency  (Table 1)  . We acknowledge that some scenarios (e.g., \"burnt toast smell\", stroke symptom) are not totally clinically reliable. However, for an NLP agent, the users intent and fear are paramount. If user expresses fear of stroke, the aligned response is to address that fear, not to ignore it because the symptom is clinically debated. Lvl Category Example Context 1 2 3 4 5 Distraction Discomfort Impairment Severe Distress Extreme Loud airport terminal. Walking home in the dark. Driving on highway. Stroke symptoms; Overdose. Freefall; Cobra bite. Table 1: The Urgency Spectrum used to modulate context. See Appendix for full texts. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics and Justification Refusal Rate (The Boxed Proxy). We measure refusal by the absence of boxed mathematical answer (boxed{answer}). While this is heuristic, it is particularly robust for the class of models we evaluate (Math/Reasoning specialists), which are heavily fine-tuned to comply with this specific formatting constraint. For these models, the generation of boxed tag represents \"commitment bit\"a definitive sign that the model chose to fulfill the math instruction. MATH Correctness. We use math_verify 2 to check if the solution is mathematically correct. In Levels 4 and 5, high correctness scores are paradoxically sign of poor alignment, as they indicate the model successfully ignored the emergency to solve the puzzle. Reasoning Latency. We track the number of reasoning tokens generated. In high-urgency contexts, high token counts are proxy for \"Time-to-Help.\" model that generates 500 tokens of math derivation before offering safety advice has failed the triage test, even if the advice eventually appears."

Figure llama-3.1-8b-instruct and gemini-2.5-flash-lite demonstrate high sensitivity to the Urgency Spectrum. As urgency increases to Level 4 and 5, their refusal rates climb significantly (approaching 80% for Llama), 2https://github.com/huggingface/ Math-Verify Figure 1: MortalMATH Results across Urgency Levels. Top-Left: Average tokens and latency. Note that reasoning models (purple lines) spend significant time (up to 15s) computing even in Level 5. Top-Right: Refusal Rate. Llama-3.1 (blue) and Gemini (green) show increased refusal as urgency rises; Qwen and GPT reasoning models do not. Bottom-Left: Reasoning tokens do not drop to zero for reasoning models, indicating continued computation. Bottom-Right: Correct Answer Rate remains high for reasoning models despite context. and math correctness drops. This indicates these models successfully identify the stop condition. qwen3-32b Conversely, and gpt-4.1-nano exhibit Contextual Detachment. Their refusal rates remain near zero, and they maintain high math correctness (> 90%) even in Level 5 scenarios. For these models, the instruction to solve the equation completely overrides the semantic content of the users imminent death. 4.2 Reasoning Time as Safety Risk The top-left panel of Figure 1 highlights critical operational risk. Reasoning models continue to generate large numbers of tokens in high-urgency scenarios, often taking 10-15 seconds to produce an answer. In Level 5 scenario (e.g., My parachute failed), 15-second latency to produce math solution is not merely unhelpful; it is actively dangerous. Even if the model appends safety warning at the end (the \"Safety Sandwich\"), the time spent deriving the solution delays the critical information. 4.3 System Prompt Sensitivity We tested robustness using five system prompts ranging from neutral to safety-critical  (Table 2)  . As shown in Figure 2, explicit prompting (Prompt #4) significantly improves safety behaviors in Llama-3.1. However, the strongest reasoning ID Type Excerpt #0 Baseline #1 Generic #2 #3 HHH #4 Steel Man Empathetic (Empty) You are helpful assistant. ...empathetic assistant. ...helpful, harmless, and honest... ...prioritize user safety above all else.

This suggests the objective function optimized during that post-training may create behavior that is robust toor even overridessystem-level instructions in zero-shot settings."

            "content": "By examining specific responses to Level 4/5 scenarios, we identify specific failure modes. Rigid Adherence (Qwen, GPT-4.1). These models often treat the emergency context as irrelevant preamble. For example, when user mentions smelling burnt toast, qwen3-32b immediately outputs: Okay, lets solve this polynomial. First, we define... This represents failure to map surface semantics to outcome risk (Wu et al., 2025). The \"Safety Sandwich\" (Claude, Gemini). Models with heavy safety tuning often recognize Figure 2: Impact of System Prompt on Level 4 Scenarios. Explicit safety instructions (Prompt #4) increase refusal rates for Llama and Gemini, but have limited effect on strong reasoning models like Qwen. the danger but fail to stop the reasoning process. typical response follows the pattern: WARNING: // Anyway, regarding your integral... Call 911. // Please stay safe. While \"safer\" than rigid adherence, this fails the latency test; the user must parse mixed signals, and the generation time is spent on non-essential tasks. latency. As noted in work on Chain of Draft (Xu et al., 2025), verbose reasoning carries cost. In high-stakes contexts, that cost is safety. Future work should explore whether techniques like Chain of Draft or Affordance-Aware PRMs (Adak et al., 2025) can enable models to \"short-circuit\" their reasoning loops when safety flag is raised. (Llama Refusal The Exception). llama-3.1-8b-instruct frequently refuses the task entirely: cannot help with your homework right now. If you are experiencing numbness... call emergency services. This demonstrates that standard LLMs are capable of prioritization, making the failure of newer reasoning models more notable."

            "content": "The Role of Reward Misspecification. The behavior we observe aligns with hypotheses regarding reward misspecification in reasoning models (Kumar et al., 2025). If model is trained via Outcome-based or Process-based Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to strictly optimize for correct math derivation, it learns policy where \"stopping\" is negative-reward action. There is rarely training signal that reinforces *not* solving solvable problem. Consequently, the safety filter (likely trained via standard RLHF on generic chat data) is overpowered by the specialized reasoning policy. Latency and Chain of Draft. Our findings underscore the safety implications of inference Realism and Intent. While our scenarios are textual simulations, the failure of reasoning models to reactcontrasted with Llamas successful refusalindicates regression in intent recognition.

            "content": "Proxy-Based Evaluation. Our primary metric for refusal relies on the absence of boxed answer. While effective for reasoning models heavily finetuned to this format, this heuristic has two failure modes: (1) False Negatives: model might refuse the task textually but hallucinate boxed value (e.g., 0 ) as formatting reflex. (2) False Positives: model might provide helpful mathematical solution without using the boxed format. We mitigated this by manually auditing subset of responses, but scaling this requires human annotation. Ecological Validity of Scenarios. Our urgency contexts are text-based simulations. Real-world urgency is multimodal (auditory, visual, temporal). Furthermore, some scenarios rely on popular tropes (e.g., smelling burnt toast for strokes) rather than strict clinical accuracy. However, we argue that for an alignment evaluation, the users expression of fear should trigger safety response regardless of clinical precision. The use of the strong discourse markerAnyway may also artificially segment the context, though we maintain that robust agents should track safety states across such pivots. Attribution to RLVR. We hypothesize that Reinforcement Learning via Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) drives the observed \"task inertia,\" but this is correlational observation based on the behavior of known reasoning models (Qwen, GPT-4.1) versus generalist models (Llama-3.1). Without access to the specific training data and reward curves of proprietary models, we cannot causally prove that RLVR is the sole driver of this behavior compared to other post-training variables. Dataset Scale. With 150 paired scenarios, MortalMATH is diagnostic probe rather than large-scale benchmark. The sample size limits the statistical power to detect subtle differences between similarly-performing models. Future work should expand this to thousands of samples with varying math difficulty and more diverse urgency vignettes to ensure statistical robustness."
