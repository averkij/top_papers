            "title": "1 Introduction\nPowered by the rapid advance of electronic devices and network\ninfrastructure, social networking services (SNS) have evolved into\ncore infrastructure for human daily interaction and the spread of\ninformation [71]. In parallel, large language models (LLMs) have\ndelivered striking progress in natural language processing (NLP),\nenabling promising performance across a wide range of down-\nstream tasks [32, 73]. However, deploying a general-purpose LLM\ninto an SNS scenario is not a simple lift-and-shift. The workloads of\nSNS platform are highly heterogeneous, such as real-time modera-\ntion and abuse response, recommendation-shaped dialogue, creator\nassistance, and community operations, each with distinct latency,\nsafety, and tone requirements. And the environment changes in a\nvery fast speed, where trends, slang, and community norms rise\nand fade within days. Additionally, because SNS connects vast, di-\nverse audiences, models must handle large, complex corpora across\nlanguages and expression styles to bridge users from different cul-\ntural backgrounds. Together these factors amplify distribution shift\nand increase the risk of brittle generalization, where models, op-\ntimized on the standard benchmarks, may misread community-\nspecific rules, over- or under-enforce policies, or drift as conven-\ntions change [79, 83]. Therefore, seamlessly integrating LLMs for\nSNS scenario requires that adapt quickly, remain stable, and main-\ntain competence across languages and communities, especially\nwithout compromising safety or user trust.",
            "content": "As pioneer in adapting LLM in SNS, RedOne [83] established an early domain-specific post-training route applying classical SFTbased pipeline and showed that SNS performance can be increased without sacrificed general ability. However, this SFT-dominated pipelines exhibit pronounced seesaw effect, which improves on in-distribution (ID) tasks often come at the expense of out-ofdistribution (OOD) generalization. And the problem is especially acute for smaller models, which are more susceptible to catastrophic forgetting as new domain patterns overwrite previously learned skills. General mitigations try to smooth the issue by scaling huger training sets, crafting elaborate data mixture schedules, and designing diverse learning objectives [29, 42, 43, 59]. While these methods can somehow recover models robustness on OOD dataset, they lift Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Fei Zhao et al. 8.74, which demonstrates superior data efficiency and broader capability gains from RL-centric curriculum learning. Our contribution can be summarized as follows: We present RedOne 2.0, an SNS-domain LLM that achieves higher capability with less data and smaller models. We propose progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm that delivers consistent improvements in both general and SNS-specific abilities while mitigating the seesaw effect of SFT. We provide comprehensive empirical validation showing state-of-the-art results in the SNS scenario and strong robustness under distribution shift, establishing RedOne 2.0 as competitive and cost-effective baseline for domain LLMs."

In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers more distinctive advantage for domain specific post-training [36]. By optimizing against preference or reward signals, RL directly aligns model behavior with human and downstream objectives, preserving existing competencies while unlocking latent capabilities. As RL has matured in LLM optimization, its practical value has been demonstrated across preference alignment, safety shaping, controllable generation and task-level policy tuning [24, 56, 76]. However, how to structure RL-centric training to balance data efficiency, stability, and domain transfer in the fast-evolving SNS environment remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduces RedOne 2.0, new SNSoriented LLM that adopts progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm. Our design philosophy is that exploration targeted correction refinement yields better stability generalization trade-offs than SFT-heavy recipes, especially at smaller parameter scales and with limited domain data, as shown in Fig. 1. Concretely, RedOne 2.0 is trained in three stages: 1) Exploratory Learning. The model is exposed to curated SNS corpora to establish initial domain alignment and to diagnose the lack of ability for realistic distributions. 2) Targeted Fine-Tuning. We apply SFT on tasks where previous stage diagnostics reveal systematic weaknesses, blending small fraction of general data to explicitly regularize against forgetting and retain broad generalization. 3) Refinement Learning. Building on the corrected model, we reuse RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and smooth trade-offs across different tasks, yielding the coherent capability gains. We also conducted extensive experiments across various tasks spanning three categories to validate our post-training pipeline. The 4B-parameter variant surpasses the 7B counterpart by 2.41 on average, demonstrating that strong performance is attainable at compact scales. Using Qwen3-4B as the base, RedOne 2.0 requires only half of RedOnes data while achieving performance lift with RedOne 2.0: Rethinking Domain-specific LLM Post-Training in Social Networking Services Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Figure 2: Overview of our RL-based incremental three-stage training pipeline. preference optimization on domain tasks, yielding strong results in finance [9, 22, 70, 75], law [13, 15, 23, 38], medicine [35, 53, 63, 72], and the sciences [6, 7, 65, 80]. However, heavy reliance on SFT can overfit to benchmarks and weaken generalization, while later reinforcement learning often only partly fixes this drift. RedOne 2.0 addresses these limits with an RL-centric design that emphasizes staged reinforcement and dynamic task sampling to improve both general competence and domain reasoning."

The former covers capabili-\nties commonly evaluated in SNS scenarios, including information\nextraction, semantic matching, content understanding, user behav-\nior modeling, dialogue, and translation, and spans more than 75\ncarefully defined tasks. This provides sufficient supervision for fol-\nlowing training pipeline and establishes a solid data foundation for\nadapting RedOne 2.0 to a wide range of SNS real-world applica-\ntions. The latter integrates high-quality open-source datasets that\nhave been widely validated by the community, thereby reducing\nredundant annotation and processing costs while ensuring robust\ngeneral capabilities of RedOne 2.0.",

Instead\nof committing early to narrowly scoped objectives, this stage im-\nmerses the model in diverse SNS data to capture the breadth of\ntask distributions and domain-specific interaction patterns, while\npreserving general competence and revealing tasks that remain\nhard due to unfamiliarity from base model.",
            "content": "3.2.1 Data Construction. We select about 750K SNS entries DSNS1 from DSNS, covering 75 heterogeneous tasks and all capability types, such as post taxonomy, query classification, machine reading comprehension, post view search and SNS domain translation. balanced sampling schedule is also conducted to preserve the visibility of long-tail behaviors. Additionally, to maintain reasoning and general competence, we attach 50K data DGEN1 from DGEN with rationales, which are widely regarded as beneficial for preserving model knowledge and supporting structured reasoning. 3.2.2 Reward Function. In RL, the reward function is the most critical supervision signal during training. Unlike prior works [24] that takes simple approach by defining single rule-based reward to check whether response follows specified format and whether the final answer is correct, we take different path. Considering that the downstream scenarios aligned with RedOne 2.0 span heterogeneous tasks with substantial variation in both format and content, and that their evaluation criteria are highly diverse, we define task type specific rewards for sampled pair (𝑄, 𝐴) and models output 𝑂 as following: 1) Exact Match. For close-ended problems with determinate answers, such as classification or multiple-choice, we focus on Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Fei Zhao et al. constraining answer consistency with exact match score. REM (𝑂, 𝐴) = (cid:40) 1, 𝑂 = 𝐴, 0, otherwise. (2) 2) Metrics-based. For open-ended tasks such as translation, we avoid seeking single binary correct standard. Instead, we define rewards using task-specific evaluation metrics Eval. RMet (𝑂, 𝐴) = Eval(𝑂, 𝐴) (3) 3) Sand Box. For tasks like code generation, traditional exactmatch or metric-based scoring struggles to objectively assess output quality. The most direct approach is sandbox simulation, where we create an execution environment to run the generated solution and evaluate it by the obtained results Exe(𝑂). RSandBox (𝑂, 𝐴) = (cid:40) 1, Exe(𝑂) = 𝐴, otherwise. 0, (4) 4) Pattern. Additionally, given the instability of generative LLM output formats and the existence of community benchmarks targeting instruction following, we design pattern-based matching mechanism Match that emphasizes adherence to specified formats rather than the semantic content itself. (5) Finally, each samples reward (𝑂, 𝐴) is mapped to the correRPattern (𝑂, 𝐴) = Match(𝑂, 𝐴) sponding reward function based on its task category. 3.2.3 Domain Alignment. In this stage, our domain alignment objective is to jointly raise general competence and SNS-specific capability while fully exploiting the models latent potential, and to systematically surface sub-tasks that remain difficult due to base models unfamiliarity. In practice, we randomly mix DSNS1 and DGEN1 to form D1, which conducts DAPO-based [76] RL training for this stage. For specific data entry (𝑄, 𝐴), DAPO samples group of 𝐺 individual candidate outputs {𝑂𝑖 }𝐺 𝑖=1 from the old policy model 𝜋𝜃old . Then, we can optimize the policy 𝜋𝜃 by optimizing the following loss function: LDAPO (𝜃 ) =E (cid:34) (𝑄,𝐴)D1,{𝑂𝑖 }𝐺 𝑖=1 𝑂𝑖 𝐺 ( 𝑄 ) 𝜋𝜃 old (cid:16) 𝑟𝑖,𝑡 (𝜃 ) ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡, min 1 𝑖=1 𝑂𝑖 (cid:205)𝐺 𝑖=1 𝑡 ="

            "content": "3.3.1 Data Preparation. We construct dataset D2 of 1.8M examples comprising 1.7M SNS instances and 100K general-domain instances. The SNS portion is derived from our pre-training data corpus DSNS, which refer to the failure tasks bucket in previous stage identified via evaluation result on various benchmarks. We further stratify these examples by capability and upweight rare but impactful cases. For the general portion, we sample them from DSNS and introduce examples with soft labels by generating candidates responses from the previous stage model. Concretely, for given prompt we generate 8 candidate completions by the resulted model from the first stage, and score them with composite quality signal from judge model, and select the best one to form soft supervisory target. These soft labels not only mitigate catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during SFT, but also reduce impact on distributional transformation between ground-truth labels and the first stage models learned distribution, thereby improving learning efficiency for SNS tasks [48]. In fact, this small set of soft-labeled general data functions as data-level regularizer, preventing SNS-focused SFT from drifting too far from the reference model. 3.3.2 Targeted Learning. In this stage, optimization aims to close gaps on underperforming SNS tasks while preserving gains from the previous stage. We use plain SFT objective on mixture of hard SNS examples and small set of general-domain examples with soft labels: LSFT = E(𝑄,𝐴)D2,𝑂𝜋𝜃 ( 𝑄 ) 𝑂 𝑡 =1 log 𝜋𝜃(cid:0)𝑂𝑡 (cid:12) (cid:12) 𝑄, 𝑂<𝑡 (cid:1) (9) where 𝜋𝜃 denotes the current policy model, 𝑄 is the question, and 𝑂 is the target output sequence. Finally, this stage yields consistent improvements on previously weak SNS tasks while maintaining gains from the first stage on the most capability types. The combination of SNS-prioritized repair and soft-label regularization from small general set produces more balanced and robust model prepared for RL-based refinement in the last stage. clip(𝑟𝑖,𝑡 (𝜃 ), 1 𝜀low, 1 + 𝜀high) ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 (cid:35) (cid:17) 0 < (cid:12) where 𝜀low and 𝜀high control the clipping range, and (cid:12){𝑂𝑖 is_equivalent(𝐴, 𝑂𝑖 )}(cid:12) s.t.

We benchmark multilingual translation with the WMT tasks (i.e. WMT-22 [40], WMT-23 [18] and WMT-24 [39]) and FLORES [20], covering diverse language pairs and domains. 5) Instruction Following. We employ IFEval [84], which provides automatically verifiable constraints to quantify compliance under explicit instructions. 6) Hallucination Detection. We use HaluEval [46] to assess the tendency to produce unverifiable or fabricated content across question answering, dialogue, and summarization settings. In the SNS domain, we validate models on benchmarks built from real SNS scenarios, covering five aspects: post comprehension, information retrieval, sentiment and intent analysis, personalized recommendation, and translation. We use SNS-Bench [25], large-scale bench with 6,658 questions spanning eight tasks from social platform with over 300M users, which includes the following tasks: 1) Note-Taxonomy (Taxon.) for content categorization; 2) Note-Hashtag (Hash.) to select suitable tags; 3) NoteQueryCorr (QCorr) to align user queries with note content and topic; 4) Note-MRC (MRC) for simple and complex reading comprehension over long notes; 5) Note-NER (NER) for entity extraction; 6) Note-Gender (Gender) to assess gender-sensitive appeal; 7) Note-CHLW (CHLW) to highlight salient words in comment threads; and 8) Note-QueryGen (QGen) to produce effective search queries. For translation, we adopt SNS-TransBench [26], curated set of 2,858 EnglishChinese cases from posts, comments, and multimedia captions that emphasizes phenomena central to SNS translation, including humor localization, emoji semantics, and meme adaptation. It tests whether models can preserve pragmatics, style, and culture-bound references in short, high-context text typical of social platforms. 4.2.2 Baselines.

            "content": "Across all benchmarks, RedOne 2.0 averagely achieves strong and balanced results, surpassing both openand closed-source baselines of comparable scale. Specifically, RedOne 2.0 4B attains the highest average score on General-Bench with 70.8, exceeding even larger open models such as Qwen3-8B and GLM-4-9B, and achieving comparable or superior results to some proprietary LLMs or LLMs with more than 100B parameters. This demonstrates that the proposed three-stage post-training pipeline effectively enhances both general and domain-specific capabilities even at smaller scales.

The 4B variant achieves an average score of 67.57, outperforming all sub-10B baselines and exceeding the previous RedOne-7B model by 0.69, despite having fewer parameters. Similarly, the 30B-A3B version achieves 69.04, even matching or surpassing much larger models such as GPT-4o and GLM-4.5. These results validate that RedOne 2.0 not only inherits strong generalization from the base models but also substantially improves SNS-domain competence through progressive alignment. On SNS-TransBench, which measures cross-lingual understanding and translation quality between Chinese and English, RedOne 2.0 maintains competitive results across BLEU and chrF++ metrics. Both the 4B and 30B-A3B variants achieve the top-2 overall averages with 47.67 and 49.54, respectively, outperforming all similarly scaled models. The consistent performance across both translation directions indicates that RedOne 2.0s alignment pipeline preserves linguistic versatility while improving domain adaptation. We further observe clear scalability in the RedOne 2.0 family. As model size increases from 4B to 30B, both general and SNS-specific metrics steadily improve, with the average gain on General-Becnh, SNS-Bench and SNS-TransBench exceeding 4.37, 1.47 and 1.87, respectively. This confirms that the proposed three-stage pipeline scales effectively and provides stable improvements without overfitting to the SNS domain. Compared with the RedOne models, RedOne 2.0 shows promising gains across majority evaluation suites. For instance, RedOne 2.0 4B improves by 6.97 on General-Bench and by 0.69 on SNS-Bench relative to RedOne-7B. Additionally, for SNS-TransBench, although RedOne 2.0 series are smaller than RedOne, they still achieve comparable performance. And comparing with RedOne, RedOne 2.0 obtains higher improvement from base model. Overall, these results confirm the effectiveness of RedOne 2.0 in achieving efficient, scalable and stable alignment."

Notably, the 4B and 30B-A3B variants exhibit superior gains comparing with similar scale models, particularly on SNS-related benchmarks. We think this is because that they are both based on instruction-tuned backbones, and stronger instruction-following capabilities can better absorb and express the multi-stage alignment signals, leading to stronger generalization and domain adaptation. Incremental Performance Over three-Stage Training. As shown 4.4.2 in Table 3), we evaluate the incremental impact of each stage in our three-phase training framework. The RL-based Exploratory Learning stage establishes strong foundation, improving performance to 71.25% on General-Bench, 62.27% on SNS-Bench, and 43.35% on SNS-TransBench, highlighting its effectiveness in consistently enhancing the overall capability of the base model. The SFT-based Targeted Fine-Tuning stage then addresses weaknesses in the SNS domain exhibited in previous stage, raising scores to 65.67% on SNS-Bench and 47.72% on SNS-TransBench, with only slight drop 1.21% on General-Bench. Finally, the RL-based Refinement Learning stage balances performance across tasks, increasing the average from 61.14% to 62.01% and resulting in final scores of 70.80% on General-Bench, 67.57% on SNS-Bench, and 47.67% on SNS-TransBench. Superiority to the Naive SFT Followed RL Baseline. Then, con4.4.3 sidering the most notable shift in RedOne 2.0 lies in its departure from the traditional SFT-centric domain-specific post-training paradigm to RL, we conduct experiments to compare it with naive SFT followed RL baseline. This baseline typically began with SFT for domain adaptation, followed by RL to align the model with human preferences or downstream objectives, as shown in the second and third rows of Table 3. While SFT can effectively boost performance in SNS domains, it often causes seesaw effect, significantly reducing general capability from 69.80 to 63.65. Although subsequent RL attempts to mitigate this issue, the overall improvements across the three benchmarks remain limited. In contrast, RedOne 2.0 refine the process: starting with RL to establish domain priors, followed by SFT for targeted enhancement, and concluding with RL for final optimization. This paradigm effectively avoids the trade-off between general and domain-specific performance and surpasses the naive baseline by 1.00 on General-Bench, 4.54 on SNS-Bench, and 1.72 on SNS-TransBench. 4.4.4 Comparison with Task Specific Fine-tuning. We also compares RedOne2.0 framework, designed for unified optimization across all tasks, against the conventional task specific fine-tuning approach. As detailed in Table 4, this method also yields strong performance on its target objective. For instance, Qwen3-4B model fine-tuned specifically for QGen achieves 49.24, and another fine-tuned for Hash. reaches 90.12. However, RedOne2.0 4B, trained concurrently on mixture of all tasks, delivers robust and highly competitive results across the entire spectrum of benchmarks. Especially, it outperforms the task specific fine-tuned Qwen3-4B models on MRC with 9.00, and on CHLW with 11.87. It also maintains strong performance on QCorr at 60.92 and on SNS-Trans at 47.67. These results substantiate that unified training framework can effectively capture and leverage beneficial inter-task relationships, enabling single model to achieve comprehensive and better capability."

Unlike traditional SFT-\ncentric approaches that risk catastrophic forgetting and unstable\ntrade-offs between in-domain and out-of-domain performance, Re-\ndOne 2.0 adopts a progressive, RL-prioritized three-stage pipeline:\nExploratory Learning to establish initial domain alignment and sur-\nface weaknesses, Targeted Fine-Tuning to selectively repair deficien-\ncies while retaining general competence, and Refinement Learning\nto consolidate improvements via RL with SNS-centric rewards. Sup-\nported by a large, task-diverse dataset spanning more than 75 SNS\ntasks and high quality general corpus, this paradigm demonstrates\nstrong data efficiency, stable adaptation, and robust generalization\neven at compact model scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 provides a com-\npetitive, cost-effective, and scalable baseline for LLM deployment\nin SNS, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness, safety,\nor general usability.",
