            "title": "1 Introduction\nThe advance of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the\nemergence of tool-augmented agents, which integrate natural lan-\nguage reasoning with executable actions via external APIs [18, 21].\nBy grounding user intent in programmatic interactions with real-\nworld services, such agents substantially broaden the range of tasks\nthey can support, from simple information retrieval to complex\ndecision-making workflows, such as web navigation [15, 22], com-\nputer interaction [9, 14], and route planning [4, 33].",
            "content": "Among these agents, route-planning agents constitute particularly challenging application domain, operating under diverse and dynamic real-world constraints that shape everyday human mobility [3, 5, 24]. Real-world mobility requests extend far beyond Conference acronym XX, Song & Zhang et al. Figure 1: Overview of MobilityBench, systematic benchmark for evaluating route-planning agents. simple point-to-point navigation [30], often involving multiple, interacting constraints, such as user preferences (e.g., avoiding highways or minimizing transfers), ordered waypoints, modalitydependent conditions, and time-sensitive requirements. Addressing such demands requires agents to accurately interpret nuanced user instructions, invoke appropriate travel-related APIs, and generate executable itineraries with reliable cost estimatesincluding travel time, distance, and transfer countscapabilities that remain difficult to evaluate systematically in realistic mobility settings. Recent benchmarks for evaluating the planning capabilities of LLMs and agents, such as TravelBench [5] and TravelPlanner [24], primarily focus on high-level itinerary generation and abstract constraint reasoning. As result, they fall short of capturing the complexity of route planning for everyday human mobility, which requires fine-grained reasoning over large-scale, map-based environments and dynamically changing conditions. Meanwhile, systematically evaluating route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios still faces several fundamental challenges: (1) scalable scenario coverage, as evaluation must span route-planning problems of varying difficulty and combinations of constraints, ranging from simple point-to-point queries to complex multi-constraint requests; (2) non-determinism of live mapping APIs, whose responses vary over time due to traffic dynamics, service availability, and backend updates [13, 26], thereby undermining reproducibility and fair comparison; (3) comprehensive and reliable evaluation, as effective assessment requires integrating multiple objective criteria beyond LLM-based subjective judging [34] to verify APIcall validity, constraint satisfaction, and factual grounding; and (4) extensible and reproducible evaluation toolkit, as rapid advances in LLM backbones and agent frameworks demand lightweight, modular toolkit that supports easy deployment, scalable data expansion, and consistent evaluation across settings. To address these challenges, we introduce MobilityBench, scalable benchmark for evaluating route-planning agents in realworld mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from largescale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap, one of the largest map and navigation service providers in China, and is designed to reflect the diversity and complexity of everyday mobility needs while removing all personally identifiable information. It covers broad spectrum of real-world route-planning intents, including point-to-point routing, customized multi-waypoint itineraries, and multimodal route planning that integrates driving, walking, cycling, and public transit. In addition, MobilityBench supports preference-aware navigation, such as avoiding highways or minimizing transfers, as well as mobility-related information access, including bus station details, bus line information, and road congestion status. The benchmark spans queries from over 350 cities worldwide and is designed to be easily extensible, enabling continuous expansion to new regions, scenarios, and intent types. Given the inherent non-determinism and reproducibility challenges of live mapping services, MobilityBench is built around deterministic API-replay sandbox that enables reproducible, endto-end evaluation of route-planning agents. During dataset construction, responses fromrouting and points-of-interest APIs are captured and cached through standardized interface, effectively freezing traffic conditions and service states at the time of collection. During evaluation, all API calls issued by an agent are intercepted and resolved against the cached response store, ensuring that identical inputs consistently yield identical, verifiable outputs. By eliminating uncontrolled environmental variance introduced by live services, this sandbox-based design ensures that measured performance faithfully reflects an agents reasoning and tool-use capabilities rather than fluctuations in external systems. MobilityBench: Benchmark for Evaluating Route-Planning Agents in Real-World Mobility Scenarios Conference acronym XX, We further propose multi-dimensional evaluation protocol that centers on outcome validity while providing complementary assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. This protocol integrates multiple objective criteria to verify executable correctness, constraint satisfaction, and grounded API usage, enabling fine-grained and reliable assessment beyond surfacelevel plausibility. To facilitate reproducible research and rapid iteration, we publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench, supporting easy deployment, extensibility to new agent frameworks, and consistent comparison across models and settings."

            "content": "Following this approach, we leverage Qwen-4B to perform intent classification over the curated queries, identifying diverse real-world mobility scenarios that define the task taxonomy of our benchmark. Specifically, we initialize the process with two coarse-grained intent roots: information access (e.g., POI, traffic, and weather lookup) and route planning (e.g., navigation to destination). To identify long-tail and previously unobserved intents, we adopt an open-set labeling protocol, whereby queries that cannot be aligned with existing labels prompt the model to propose new candidate intents along with concise definitions. These candidate labels are subsequently iteratively consolidated, merged, and refined through multiple rounds of expert adjudication, ensuring semantic clarity, mutual exclusivity, and comprehensive coverage of the intent space. The resulting taxonomy comprises 11 task scenarios, which are further organized into four high-level Task families: Basic Information Retrieval, which encompasses fundamental information-seeking tasks, including POI Query, Geolocation Query, Nearby Query, Weather Query, and Traffic Info Query. Route-Dependent Information Retrieval, which targets information needs that require computing route as an intermediate step, including Route Property Query (e.g., distance or path characteristics) and Arrival/Departure Time Query. Basic Route Planning, which consists of two standard navigation tasks: Point-to-Point Planning, routing from single origin to single destination, and Multi-stop Planning, routing across multiple intermediate destinations. Preference-Constrained Route Planning, which covers route planning tasks involving explicit user-specified preferences or constraints beyond basic navigation. This family includes OptionConstrained Route Planning, which applies tool-native, standardized routing options such as minimizing tolls, preferring highways, optimizing for the fastest route, fewer transfers, or less walking; and Route-Constrained Planning, which enforces explicit path-level constraints specified by users, such as required waypoints or excluded roads.

Each capability is further quantified using set of fine-grained indicators, enabling precise diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and failure modes that are invisible to end-to-end metrics. Instruction Understanding. Since accurate interpretation of 3.2.1 user requirements is prerequisite for route planning, we first evaluate the agents instruction understanding capability. Drawing on standard paradigms in natural language understanding [1, 11], this capability is assessed through two indicators, detailed as follows: Intent Detection (ID). We quantify the agents ability to understand the instructional intent embedded in user query. Specifically, the agent is explicitly instructed to output set of intent labels corresponding to the task scenario categories defined in Section 3.1.2. We measure intent detection by comparing the agents predicted intent label ˆ𝑦ID (𝑥) with the ground-truth intent label 𝑦ID (𝑥) for each query 𝑥. prediction is considered correct if the similarity between the two labels exceeds predefined threshold 𝛼threshold. The overall intent detection score is computed as: ID = 1 𝑥 I(sim( ˆ𝑦ID (𝑥), 𝑦ID (𝑥)) 𝛼threshold) . (1) Information Extraction (IE). This indicator evaluates an agents ability to extract explicit and implicit constraints from user queries, including spatial attributes (e.g., origins and destinations), temporal parameters (e.g., departure windows and duration constraints), and preference-related signals (e.g., traffic avoidance or modality priorities). For query 𝑥, let ˆ𝑦IE (𝑥) and 𝑦IE (𝑥) denote the predicted and ground-truth constraint sets, respectively. An extraction is considered correct only if the two sets exactly match.

Among open-source models, Qwen3235B-A22B, MoE architecture activating only 22B parameters per forward pass, achieved DR of 85.95% and an FPR of 66.69% under the ReAct framework. Similarly, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp demonstrated strong competitiveness, attaining an FPR of 68.88% while maintaining substantially lower inference costs due to its efficient architecture. This provides high-performance and cost-effective option for enterprise-level private deployments. Framework Comparison: ReAct vs. Plan-and-Execute. systematic comparison of the two execution architectures reveals fundamental trade-off between task success rate and computational efficiency. The final pass rate of the ReAct is generally better than that of Plan-and-Execute. This is mainly due to its closed-loop \"think-act-observe\" mechanism, which allows the agent to dynamically adjust its strategy based on real-time results returned by tools, while Plan-and-Executes static pre-planning shows significant lack of robustness when facing dynamic feedback in mobile scenarios. However, ReActs superior robustness comes at nontrivial computational cost. Due to the continuous accumulation of observation history within the inference context, the average number of input tokens (IT) consumed by ReAct is significantly higher than that of Plan-and-Execute. Across all models, ReActs average IT is approximately 35.38% higher than Plan-and-Executes. This increase translates directly into higher API costs and longer wall-clock inference times. Conference acronym XX, Song & Zhang et al. Figure 3: Performance across four high-level task families. Scenario Study. To further reveal the capabilities of the model 4.2.2 in different task scenarios, we created multi-dimensional indicator radar charts for four core categories in Figure 3, evaluating representative open-source and closed-source models under both ReAct and Plan-and-Execute frameworks. The scene from left to right represents significant increase in the depth of task logic and the complexity of constraints, and Preference-constrained Planning is the category where the model is the most likely to be error as we expected. In this type of tasks, Plan-and Execute framework performs best because it establishes clear strategy in advance, which makes handling structured tasks with logical order more predictable and efficient, thereby suppressing illusions and trajectory deviations."

Appendix A.1 MobilityBench Task Scenarios To facilitate thorough understanding of the benchmarks coverage and design rationale, we present detailed taxonomy of task scenarios in Table S1, including fine-grained subtypes and their definitions, and provide additional representative examples for each category, which are designed to reflect the diversity of natural language expressions that users may employ when issuing mobility-related instructions. A.2 Sandbox Tools core design principle of MobilityBench is to evaluate agents within realistic yet reproducible tool-use environment. To this end, we provide comprehensive tool specification table as shown in Table S2. It documents each tool used in the benchmark sandbox, including the tool name, input arguments and output fields. The sandbox tools are sourced from the AMap Open Platform.
