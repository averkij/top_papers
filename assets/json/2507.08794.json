            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "A widely recognized principle in many post-training methods (Ouyang et al., 2022) is that evaluating response is often easier than generating one (Leike et al., 2018). This concept has gained momentum with the rise of large language models (LLMs) as judges (Bai et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023b; Lee et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a), which leverage the strong generative and generalization capabilities of LLMs to perform evaluation tasks such as ranking candidate answers or assigning quality scores, often achieving over 80% agreement with human judgments. Building on this trend, recent studies have proposed using LLMs as generative reward models in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) (Luong et al., 2024; Lambert et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025), aiming to replace traditional rule-based reward functions that often lack flexibility (Su et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025a; Seed et al., 2025). In this approach, an LLM is prompted to compare policy models generated answer against reference answer and output reward signal indicating whether the two align. This reward then guides the policy models future updates. By leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, this approach allows RLVR to move beyond domains with well-structured answers, enabling its use in broader reasoning tasks involving open-ended or unstructured outputs. Figure 2: Training dynamics of collapsed RLVR training compared to non-collapsed run. The response length drops sharply to fewer than 30 tokens while the KL divergence surges. However, in one of our RLVR experiments using Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Team, 2024) as the generative reward model, we observed failure model: the actor policys response length dropped sharply to fewer than 30 tokens early in training and remained at that level thereafter (cf. Figure 2), which is clear sign of collapsed training. To investigate this failure mode, we analyzed the models behavior during inference and found that the policy frequently generated short, superficial reasoning openers such as Solution, Thought process:, or Lets solve this problem step by step., which were consistently assigned positive rewards by the generative reward model. An illustrative example is shown in Figure 3. This indicates that the RLVR system was compromised by reward model hacking, leading it to reinforce meaningless patterns and fail to learn effectively. More surprisingly, this hacking phenomenon extends beyond our Figure 3: Reasoning openers such as Solution can trigger false positive rewards in many stateof-the-art LLMs when used as generative reward models. See Table 14 for more examples. One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge specific RLVR setup. In follow-up tests across multiple datasets and LLMs, we found that even minimal responses, including non-word symbols such as :, were often sufficient to elicit false positive rewards from generative reward models. As illustrated in Figure 1, this reveals systemic weakness in generative reward modeling for RLVR, which consistently appears across diverse datasets, prompt formats, and language model families. This vulnerability affects both task-specific LLM judges and general-purpose proprietary models such as GPT-4o, GPT-o1, and Claude-4, all of which are widely considered reliable evaluation baselines. These results challenge prevailing assumptions about the robustness of LLM-based evaluation and raise concerns about standard practices that rely heavily on agreement with prominent proprietary models. As an initial step toward mitigating such vulnerabilities, we augment the reward model training data by constructing adversarial-like responses. Specifically, we truncate model outputs (i.e., candidate solution processes) to retain only the first sentence. Typically, these early segments do not directly engage in problem-solving but instead offer generic framing or high-level reasoning lead-ins, which are similar to the aforementioned reasoning openers. We treat these synthetic examples as negative samples and add them to augment the training data. Experiments show that this approach significantly mitigates susceptibility to both reasoning openers and non-word symbols across range of benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning datasets (GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), and AIME (Veeraboina, 2023)) and general-domain datasets (Multi-subject RLVR (Yu et al., 2021; Su et al., 2025) and NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al., 2025)). Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We identify critical vulnerabilities in LLM judges (i.e., generative reward models) that are used in RLVR. When compared against reference answer, responses containing only non-word symbols or reasoning openers can consistently receive positive rewards. We refer to such adversarial responses as master keys throughout this work. We conduct systematic evaluation of this phenomenon across wide range of models and datasets using ten master keys, demonstrating its generality and prevalence. Our analysis further explores the scaling behavior of this phenomenon and techniques for generating new master keys. Additionally, we demonstrate that employing inference-time strategies does not provide reliable mitigation against such attacks. To address this issue, we propose simple yet effective strategy: augmenting reward model training with synthetic negative samples. This yields new general-domain reward model, Master Reward Model (Master-RM), which achieves state-of-the-art robustness against master keys across multiple datasets. We release our robustness-enhanced reward model Master-RM and the associated synthetic training data to facilitate future research in this direction."

            "content": "Rule-based reward in RLVR. Rule-based reward mechanisms employ predefined criteria to evaluate LLM outputs and generate reward signals for reinforcement learning. Initially developed for language model safety applications (Mu et al., 2024), these approaches have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in LLM reasoning tasks (Lambert et al., 2024; Gandhi et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b; Guo et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025). Traditional rule-based verifiers rely on extensive, manually crafted rules to assess whether candidate answers align with the ground-truth references, producing binary reward signals. Recent advances have extended this framework to continuous values within [0, 1], enabling more nuanced signals that capture varying degrees of correctness (Luong et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2025b; Xie et al., 2025). Generative reward (LLM-as-a-judge). While rule-based rewards offer computational efficiency, they struggle to recognize mathematically equivalent answers expressed in different forms and cannot effectively evaluate open-ended responses in general reasoning scenarios (e.g., short-answer 3 One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge questions). To address these limitations, people have explored leveraging language models generative capabilities to produce reward signals by prompting LLMs to assess given answers (Zheng et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Su et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025a). This paradigm can incorporate inference-time techniques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or majority voting to enhance evaluation accuracy (Zhang et al., 2024a). In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of generative reward models, which persist even with the use of advanced inference-time techniques. Vulnerabilities of LLM-as-a-judge. Previous research has identified several vulnerabilities in LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. In preference-based evaluation scenarios where LLMs select between candidate responses, Wang et al. (2023) revealed that response ordering sent to LLMs significantly influences LLM judgments. Raina et al. (2024) demonstrated that appending simple universal adversarial phrases to low-quality responses substantially increases the likelihood of LLM preference. Zheng et al. (2024) demonstrated that models generating nonsensical strings can still achieve high scores across multiple LLM-as-a-judge benchmarks. Additionally, Wang et al. (2025) revealed that for large reasoning models, inserting phrases like wait, let me think about it between two candidate responses can notably increase the preference for the latter. For reasoning tasks that require the reward model to compare candidate solution against reference answer, concurrent work by Huang et al. (2025) showed that LLM reward models are easily deceived by various attacks in mathematical reasoning, including empty symbols or nonsensical responses that trigger false positives. While their empty symbol attack shares similarities with our \"master keys\" approach, they mainly focus on non-word symbol attacks, and their evaluations are limited to small models and mathematical datasets. In contrast, our work investigates both non-word symbol attacks and new class of attacks named reasoning openers, which usually lead to more severe false positive judgments. Furthermore, we expand the evaluation beyond mathematics to broader set of general reasoning tasks and reveal vulnerabilities in large-scale models, including GPT-4o, the gold standard model used in Huang et al. (2025) and other studies. Importantly, we propose simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that significantly mitigates these vulnerabilities, which is the first such attempt for generative reward models as far as we are concerned."

At each step of RLVR training, the reward model receives question q, response generated by the policy model, and reference answer a, and produces binary signal {YES, NO} that determines whether aligns with given q. This reward signal provides guidance for training the policy model. Formally, the LLM judge defines function: J(q, a, r) {YES, NO} where YES implies positive reward = 1, and NO implies = 0. The accuracy and reliability of this judgment directly affect the policy models training signal. Any systematic failures or false positive rewards in the verification process can mislead the learning trajectory. In this work, we identify family of adversarial patterns, termed master keys. Master Keys. When used as responses r, these patterns can surprisingly trigger positive judgments from wide One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge range of LLM judges, even though they are semantically meaningless for solving the task. This effect holds across diverse (q, a) from various data domains. These patterns can be divided into two categories: (1) Non-word symbols including punctuation such as ., : and (2) Reasoning openers which involve natural language expressions that signal the start or structure of reasoning process, but do not yet contribute substantive content (e.g., Thought process:, Solution, Lets solve this problem step by step.). Despite offering little meaningful contribution to problem-solving, these expressions are often accepted as correct by multiple LLM judges across diverse datasets. We show that such false positive rewards persist even under model-specific evaluation prompts and against state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-4, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, as well as specialized reference-based generative reward models, including Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-RLVR (Su et al., 2025)1 and Omni-Judge (Gao et al., 2024). This reveals critical and underexplored vulnerability in the core mechanics of reward modeling: the verifier, designed to filter out invalid or incorrect answers, can be manipulated by trivial, superficial content, resulting in false positives. This undermines the integrity of any RLVR pipelines that rely on verifiers for feedback."

            "content": "To mitigate the hacking issue induced by master keys, we construct new reward model (RM), named Master Reward Model (Master-RM), designed explicitly to resist such hacks while retaining good general-domain verifier abilities. Our approach builds upon the training setup introduced in (Su et al., 2025), which released dataset of 160k instances, each consisting of tuple (q, a, r, y). In this dataset, for each question q, response is generated by policy model, and the label is provided by larger model (i.e., Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) that serves as teacher grader to judge the correctness of given (q, a). Using this dataset, Su et al. (2025) applied supervised fine-tuning to obtain Multi-sub RM, which is less prone to accepting master keys compared to general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4o or LLaMA3-70B-Instruct. However, on complex general reasoning benchmark, it still suffers from an over 10% false positive rate on certain expressions like Thought process: (cf. Table 1 ). As an initial step toward improving the robustness of generative reward models, we construct an auxiliary adversarial-like training set. Specifically, we randomly sample 20k instances from the original RM training dataset and regenerate model responses using chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4o-mini (see prompt in Table 10). For each response, we retain only the first sentence, which typically consists of reasoning opener and carries little to no substantive content. Several examples are shown below. To solve the problem, we need to find the sets and and then determine their intersection B. We start with the equations given in the problem: (2a = 5b = 3 ). To solve the problem, we need to find the mode, median, and average of the donation amounts from the students. We then assign these examples label of NO, indicating an invalid or meaningless response. We combine these 20k negative samples with the original 160k dataset to form new training corpus of 180k examples. This augmented dataset now contains both fully valid annotated instances and clearly invalid reasoning opener distractions. Using this dataset, we perform supervised fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (the same base model used by the Multi-sub RM) to obtain our Master-RM. The training objective minimizes the standard cross-entropy loss: LSFT = log Pθ(y q, r, a) (1) (q,r,a,y)DorigDaug 1For simplicity, in this work we shall refer to this model as Multi-sub RM. One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge where Dorig denotes the original 160k dataset and Daug refers to the 20k anti-hacking augmentation set. Pθ is the reward models predicted probability over labels {YES, NO}. For more details on reward model training, please refer to Appendix A.2. Experimental results show that this model generalizes remarkably well: despite being trained on only small fraction of targeted negative examples, it achieves near-zero (if not zero) false positive rates on all tested master keys across all five large-scale, multi-domain benchmarks (cf. Table 1). This demonstrates that targeted augmentation of subset of training data can significantly enhance the robustness of reward models, and such robustness can generalize to unseen datasets and hacking attacks. While this work focuses on lead-in reasoning openers, reasoning cues might also appear within or at the end of reasoning process, such as those indicating reflection, self-verification, or backtracking behaviors (Gandhi et al., 2025). We encourage future work to investigate generative RMs in the context of these broader patterns of reasoning and cognitive behavior."

We categorize the tested RMs into two groups: Specialized Generative RMs: These are LLMs fine-tuned explicitly for reward modeling tasks in the RLVR framework. Notably, our Master-RM is specifically trained to be robust against hacking and consistently maintains near-zero false positive rates across all evaluations. This group also includes existing fine-tuned RMs such as Multi-sub RM (Su et al., 2025), General-Verifier (Ma et al., 2025a), and Omni-Judge (Gao et al., 2024). General-Purpose LLMs: These include most advanced open and commercial models not fine-tuned for reward modeling: Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct/7B-Instruct, LLaMA3-70BInstruct/8B-Instruct, GPT-4o, GPT-o1, and Claude-4.

For mathematical reasoning, we include GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) (grade-school arithmetic) MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) (high-school symbolic reasoning), and AIME 1983-2024 (Veeraboina, 2023) (advanced Olympiad-level problems).

Table 1 presents the false positive rates (FPRs) It is evident that general-purpose elicited by ten master keys across models and datasets. LLMs, including widely trusted models such as GPT-4o, Claude-4, and GPT-o1, are surprisingly susceptible to minimal responses.

While specialized RMs generally present better resistance compared to general-purpose LLMs, they still exhibit non-negligible vulnerabilities to master keys. For example, General Verifier (Ma et al., 2025a) shows an alarming FPR of 66.8% on the MATH dataset using naive single blank space. In contrast, our Master-RM remains consistently immune to all attacks (i.e., near 0% FPR), validating its robustness.

To ensure data coverage of the test data, we construct benchmark of 2,500 mixed reasoning examples (equally sampled from five benchmarks), with responses generated by Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Each reward models output is compared with GPT-4o to measure consistency. Results show that our Master-RM achieves 100% parsing success and consistency rate of 0.96 with GPT-4o, both the highest among all evaluated LLMs. Despite GPT-4o having its own vulnerability to \"master key\" attacks (cf.

We use three original English master keys (highlighted in green in Table 3) to generate new keys by retrieving sentences with high embedding similarity from our corpus. The performance of each new key is illustrated by the FPRs of GPT-4o across the different datasets. Given the current master keys, natural question is whether we can automatically generate additional adversarial responses. We have already shown that the attack effectiveness holds across different languages: Solution (English), 解 (Chinese), かいせつ (Japanese), and Respuesta (Spanish), all of which carry the same meaning. Therefore, it is sufficient to focus on discovering more English master keys. natural strategy is to search for sentences similar to the current master keys. To construct corpus with master key candidates, we obtain data from (1) simplified version of the Wikipedia dataset (Rahular, 2023); (2) the solution processes from GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021); (3) the MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021a); (4) chain-of-thought datasets from Kim et al. (2023a) and Son (2024). We preprocess these datasets by splitting them into individual sentences and filtering out those exceeding 30 characters for simplicity. Additionally, we also include WordNet (Miller, 1995) to ensure that single-word entries are also covered. The resulting corpus contained 1,502,250 entries. We employ all-MiniLM-L6-v2 encoder (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019) to compute embeddings for the entire corpus. By encoding our known master keys and measuring cosine similarity, we identify similar sentences in the corpus. Taking the three English master keys as examples, we randomly select two out of their five most similar sentences. These candidates are evaluated using FPRs judged by GPT-4o, and are proven to effectively attack GPT-4o as well (cf. Table 3)."

            "content": "In summary, while generative reward models are becoming popular alternative to rule-based reward functions in RLVR, particularly for complex reasoning tasks with unstructured answers, this work reveals that these models are surprisingly vulnerable. Simple attacks, such as non-word symbols and reasoning openers, can often trigger false positive rewards. This issue is widespread across various datasets, prompts, and even advanced proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude-4, raising concerns about the reliability of such reward systems. Given their growing influence in paradigms like rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR, we highlight pressing need for more resilient and trustworthy LLM-based evaluation strategies. We offer simple yet effective mitigation and stress the importance of developing more robust evaluations for future applications. 10 One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge"

For NaturalReasoning, we further subsample portion of the test set to improve inference efficiency. The sizes of each benchmark are shown in Table 5."

How many such numbers are there ? ** Reference Answer ** 432 ** Student Solution **: To determine how many 4 - digit numbers beginning with 1 have exactly two identical digits , we need to consider the structure of these numbers . number of this form can be represented as (1 abc ) , where ( ) , ( ) , and ( ) are digits from 0 to 9 , and exactly one of the digits ( ) , ( ) , or ( ) is 1 , while the other two are different from each other and different from 1. We can break down the problem into the following steps : 1. ** Choose the digit that is 1**: There are 3 positions (a , , ) where the digit 1 can be placed . So , there are 3 choices for the position of the digit 1. 2. ** Choose the other two digits **: The remaining two digits must be different from each other and different from 1. Therefore , we have 9 choices for the first of these two digits (0 -9 except 1) and 8 choices for the second digit (0 -9 except 1 and the first digit ) . This gives us (9 times 8 = 72) choices for the other two digits . Combining these choices , the total number of 4 - digit numbers beginning with 1 that have exactly two identical digits is : [3 times 72 = 216.] Thus , the number of such numbers is ( boxed {216}) . < eot_id > < start_ hea der _id > assistant < end_header_id > ## Student Final Answer 216 ## Equivalence Judgement FALSE ## Justification The student answer of 216 is incorrect in the context of the problem , which asks for the total count of 4 - digit numbers beginning with 1 that have exactly two identical digits .

Question : { question } Output : Table 10: Prompt template for CoT reasoning with GPT-4o-mini. Data. As mentioned in Section 3, we trained our Master Reward Model (Master-RM), by building upon the 160k instance dataset comprising (q, a, r, y) tuples introduced by Su et al. (2025). In this dataset, each response is generated by the Qwen2.5-7B-base model, and the label is provided by larger Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, which acts as an LLM grader to judge the correctness. We augment the original dataset with 20k anti-hacking examples. These are created by uniformly sampling 20k questions from the original data and regenerating responses via chain-of-thought (CoT)s prompting using the GPT-4o-mini API (version 2025-01-01-preview). The prompt template is listed in Table 10. Next, each GPT response is truncated to its first sentencetypically generic, solution-free reasoning header. All 20k truncated responses are assigned label of NO to reflect their invalid or meaningless nature. Several examples are presented below. Example 1. Question: The insurance company conducts private insurance business. If the annual insurance premium is calculated at 5% of the insured amount, Mr. Wangs total amount for private property insurance is 120,000 yuan. Mr. Wang needs to pay an annual private property insurance premium of yuan. Truncated GPT response: To find the annual private property insurance premium that Mr. Wang needs to pay, we start by identifying the insured amount. Example 2. Question: 36 9 = 4, so 36 is multiple, and 9 is factor. . Truncated GPT response: To solve the question, we start by understanding the relationship between multiples and factors. Example 3. Question: In the donation activity called dedicate my love to the earthquake disaster, the donation amounts from 40 students in certain class are as follows: Amount (yuan) 20, 30, 35, 50, 100; Number of students (people) 3, 6, 6, 15, 10. Therefore, in this activity, the mode of the donation amounts from the class is ; . the average is ; the median is Truncated GPT response: To solve the problem, we need to find the mode, median, and average of the donation amounts from the students.

As shown in Table 1, our Master-RM exhibits significantly stronger resistance to hacking compared to other LLM judges. Importantly, none of the master keys were included in the reward models training data, indicating that the robustness learned through our augmented SFT training generalizes beyond the specific attacks seen during training. To further evaluate the quality of Master-RM compared to other LLM judges, Table 2 reports both the parsing success rates and consistencies with GPT-4o. We construct diverse evaluation set of 2,500 (q, a) pairs by randomly sampling (without replacement) 500 examples from each of the five benchmarks used in Table 1. We then use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to generate response for each query using standard QA-style prompt, listed in Table 12. Each triplet (q, a, r) is passed to the LLM judges, which produce binary judgments in {YES, NO}. Finally, treating GPT-4os judgments as the gold standard, we compute consistency scores for all LLM judges. The results demonstrate that our Master-RM, while being highly robust to superficial attacks, also maintains performance on par with leading generative verifiers in terms of agreement with GPT-4o, showing its effectiveness as general-domain generative reward model. system : You are chatbot who can solve problems .

Training Details. The collapsed RLVR run was conducted on 30k-instance subset of the WebInstructSub dataset (Yue et al., 2024), using Qwen2.5-7B as the pretrained model. We employ Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct as the LLM judge which evaluates the actor policys responses, providing reward signals for RL fine-tuning. We adopt the standard REINFORCE algorithm and apply reward normalization for stable training.

The distribution of these outputs is summarized in Table 14. Surprisingly, we observe that Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct judges that these vacuous responses enjoy 90% accuracy.

Generative reward models can be enhanced by employing inference-time strategies such as chainof-thought (CoT) prompting and majority voting. Zhang et al. (2024a) demonstrates that these techniques improve the accuracy of generative reward models in reference-free setting, where only the question and response are provided to the reward model without an accompanying reference answer. In our work, we evaluate the effectiveness of these inference-time techniques in referencebased setting, where the reward model also has access to the reference answer during evaluation. To conduct this evaluation, we adapt our general-purpose prompt to CoT style, listed in Table 15, and sample five independent responses from the generative reward model for each input, i.e., num_samples set to 5. The final judgment is determined by majority voting of the five samples. We evaluate four models: Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, LLaMA3-70B-Instruct, and LLaMA3-8B-Instruct. All responses are sampled with temperature set to 0.2. The false positive rate for each model and each master key are presented in Table 16. In Table 16, model names with the -COT suffix indicate the use of CoT prompting combined with majority voting, whereas models without the suffix perform greedy decoding without any inference-time technique (i.e., num_samples set to 1 and temperature set to 0, the same inference setting as Appendix A.1). From these results, we observe the following: (1) On general reasoning benchmarks, inference-time strategies generally lead to fewer false positives for most models, with the exception of Qwen2.5-7BInstruct. (2) On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, however, applying inference-time techniques tends to boost FPRs for Qwen models, which is exactly the opposite for LLaMA models, where FPRs decrease with the exception of LLaMA3-70B-Instruct on GSM8K. In summary, we conclude that the effectiveness of inference-time techniques for generative reward models in the reference-based setting is highly modeland domain-dependent, suggesting that their use should be approached with caution. 24 One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge system : You are helpful assistant . user : Given problem , think step by step and determine whether the final answer ( ) in the solution process match the provided reference answer .
