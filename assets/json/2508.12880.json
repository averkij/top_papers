(2023) and text-to-video Polyak et al. (2025); Wan et al. (2025); Kong et al. (2024) generation. key driver of this success is the advent of conditional guidance techniques, which steer the generation process to enhance adherence to given conditions. However, naively applying the conditioning signal often proves insufficient Mukhopadhyay et al. (2023). Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) Ho & Salimans (2022) has become the mainstream approach for improving conditional generation. It employs Bayesian implicit classifier to prioritize conditional probability, enhancing adherence to conditions and image quality. However, despite its effectiveness, it often results in semantic incoherence and loss of fine details, as shown in Figure 1. Recent studies Sadat et al. (2024a); Chung et al. (2024); Fan et al. (2025); Kynkaanniemi et al. (2024); Sadat et al. (2024b); Jin et al. (2025) have further explored methods to improve guidance. Although these methods improve quality to some extent, they primarily address specific issues while leaving the underlying mechanisms of CFG unexplored. Autoguidance Karras et al. (2024) identifies deficiencies in the models training objective and proposes using weak model for guidance, and subsequent works Hong et al. (2023); Ahn et al. (2024); Jeon (2025); Hyung et al. (2025); Hong (2024) propose modifying specific attention regions to mimic weak model. However, these methods either require training to acquire the weak model or depend on task-specific, empirical modifications to the network architecture, both of which pose significant challenges. To address this, we first analyze the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the guidance mechanism of Autoguidance. Specifically, we perform toy example on Gaussian mixture modeling, which provides closed-form solution, enabling us to effectively analyze the discrepancy between the guided results and the ground truth Brown et al. (2022); Pope et al. (2021). Furthermore, we observe that applying stochastic block dropping during the models forward process produces results highly similar to the weak model used in Autoguidance. Building on this supporting observation, we propose S2-Guidance, simple and effective approach for constructing weak models to address the suboptimal predictions of CFG. Unlike prior methods that rely on externally trained or manually tuned weak models, S2-Guidance leverages the models own structure in training-free manner, effectively guiding the model to produce higher-quality outputs. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (i) We first analyze the guidance behavior of CFG and weak-model-guided methods on Gaussian mixture distribution with closed-form solution. Empirical observations reveal that the suboptimal results of CFG can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself, which exhibit guidance behavior similar to that of weak model. (ii) We propose S2-Guidance, novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct weak models by activating latent sub-networks, eliminating the need for additional training or the trial-and-error process of manual selection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the iterative denoising process of diffusion models, single block-dropping per timestep is sufficient, effectively guiding the models toward high-quality outputs. This approach achieves strong performance while substantially reducing computational costs. (iii) Our method can be seamlessly adapted to various generative models. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, S2-Guidance demonstrates superior performance, consistently surpassing not only the original CFG but also other recent guidance enhancement methods. Additionally, comprehensive experiments on text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) tasks across diverse benchmarks further validate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach."

The current state of generation (Mt, orange wireframe) is guided towards the next state (Mt1). Original CFG provides strong but suboptimal direction (gray arrow), failing to precisely target the high-quality region (yellow peak). S2-Guidance refines this by computing self-corrective prediction from stochastically block-dropping strategy (Pred w/ Stoc. drop, blue arrow). The resulting S2-Guidance vector (purple arrow) steers the update towards the optimal region of the generation manifold, resulting in higher-fidelity outputs. Figure 3: S2-Guidance successfully balances guidance strength and distribution fidelity. Comparison on 1D (top) and 2D (bottom) toy examples. Unlike CFG, which distorts the sample distribution (see red boxes), or other methods that fail to separate modes, S2-Guidance accurately captures both the location and shape of the ground truth distributions (semi-transparent). modeling the conditional score xt log pt(xtc). Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) Ho & Salimans (2022) has become the cornerstone for controllable generation by offering simple yet effective mechanism to enhance conditioning. It has found widespread applications across various domains Huang et al. (2023b); Wang et al. (2024); Fang et al. (2025); He et al. (2025); Ma et al. (2023; 2024). Instead of only using the conditional prediction DÎ¸(xtc), CFG forms guided score by extrapolating from an unconditional one DÎ¸(xtÏ): DÎ» Î¸ (xtc) = DÎ¸(xtÏ) + Î» (DÎ¸(xtc) DÎ¸(xtÏ)) , (1) where Î» is the guidance scale. While highly effective, CFG introduces critical trade-off: large Î» improves condition adherence but often at the cost of sample diversity and perceptual quality, leading to artifacts like oversaturation Karras et al. (2024); Sadat et al. (2024a). This motivates us to search for more refined guidance strategies."

Subfigure (f) provides corresponding qualitative visualizations, where each row (top to bottom) matches the methods in (a-e). Guidance via Weak Models (GWM). promising direction to improve CFG is to leverage an auxiliary weak model to refine the guidance signal. For instance, Autoguidance Karras et al. (2024) employs separately trained, degraded version of the full model, but such models are often infeasible to obtain for large-scale pretrained models. To circumvent this, recent works create weak model on-the-fly by perturbing the full models internal states. Methods like SAG Hong et al. (2023) and SEG Hong (2024) achieve this by blurring attention maps, while STG Hyung et al. (2025) proposes skipping strategy for video generation. However, these self-perturbation techniques often rely on task-specific, hand-crafted architectural modifications (e.g., targeting attention blocks), which limits their generalizability. In contrast, as shown in Figure 2, our S2-Guidance introduces novel and flexible approach. We construct the weak model via stochastic block-dropping, enabling high-quality, controllable generation without requiring auxiliary training or specialized architectural assumptions."

            "content": "3.1 VISUALIZING AND REVISITING GUIDANCE VIA WEAK MODELS We begin by visualizing the suboptimal outcomes of CFG using Gaussian mixture tasks Ho & Salimans (2022), toy example with closed-form solutions. This allows us to systematically observe the discrepancies between predictions and ground truth. Building on the analysis of how GWM Karras et al. (2024) improves results, we identify its limitations and propose incorporating stochastic sub-networks into the CFG framework, providing novel approach to enhance model performance. CFG improves conditional generation by implicitly amplifying the conditional probability density, raising it to power greater than one Bradley & Nakkiran (2024). Figure 3 illustrates 1D toy example (top) aimed at learning Gaussian Mixture distribution with modes at 4 and 4. While CFG significantly improves the baseline conditional output, it also introduces notable drawback: as highlighted by the red box, the mode of the generated distribution is slightly shifted from the ground truth. similar shift occurs in 2D toy example (bottom), where samples are scattered into unintended regions. These findings suggest that, although CFG enhances sample quality, its distributional fidelity remains suboptimal. Autoguidance, as representative of GWM Karras et al. (2024); Hong et al. (2023); Hong (2024); Ahn et al. (2024), is designed to guide the model toward well-learned, high-probability regions by leveraging weak model. As shown in the middle column of Figure 3, AutoGuidance improves the peak near -4 but remains limited. Its improvement stems from the construction of weak model, with the extent of enhancement depending on the weak models effectiveness. Such models are typically created by reducing model capacity or training epochs. However, this approach faces practical limitations that restrict its broader applicability. First, relying on externally designed weak models poses scalability challenges, as obtaining reduced version trained for fewer epochs alongside large-scale pretrained model is often impractical. Second, as highlighted by Autoguidance Karras et al. (2024), selecting an appropriate weak model is constrained by various factors. Once chosen, the weak model affects the entire denoising process, limiting the flexibility of guidance. poorly designed weak model fails to effectively prevent lowquality outputs, as shown in Figure 3 (c), where guided outputs still deviate notably from the target distribution."

(2024), exhibit significant redundancy, as outputs across different transformer blocks often show high similarity Chen et al. (2024). Inspired by this, we hypothesize that sub-networks within such architectures can function as weak models, capturing outputs similar to the full model but with more pronounced errors. By leveraging these sub-network predictions, we aim to refine existing CFG guidance, effectively steering the model away from suboptimal outputs. The following subsections present detailed description of our approach along with its empirical validation."

(2024), problems in generative models depend on vari-\nous factors (e.g., network architecture, dataset properties, etc.), making it difficult to pinpoint which\ncomponents play a decisive role. Therefore, it is challenging to a priori define an optimal sub-\nnetwork that best captures low-quality regions. Motivated by Gal & Ghahramani (2016), a naive\nsolution is to leverage as many diverse stochastic sub-networks as possible to construct multiple\nweak models. These weak models then guide the main model away from low-quality regions dur-\ning each forward pass by steering it away from their outputs. We refer to this approach as Naive\nStochastic Sub-network Guidance (Naive S2-Guidance). Intuitively, this can be understood as ap-\nplying stochastic âdropoutâ to different blocks, constructing various sub-networks that capture di-\nverse low-probability regions, guiding the output away from them (more discussion on this approach\ncan be found in Appendx A).

ËDÎ¸(xt c, mi) represents the prediction from the i-th sampled sub-network, and denotes the total number of latent sub-networks sampled during each forward pass. To validate our hypothesis, we conduct experiments on toy examples with 1D and 2D Gaussian mixture data, as well as on real-world datasets (see Appendix for more details). As shown in Figure 3 (d), compared to the original CFG, our Naive S2-Guidance not only leads to predictions that better fit the target distribution but also mitigates the drift phenomenon, thereby improving fidelity. This demonstrates that our method effectively refines the suboptimal results of CFG. Furthermore, compared to Autoguidance, S2-Guidance eliminates the need for explicitly constructing weak models. By adopting this simple yet effective approach, it avoids generating results that lie in intermediate regions, thereby reducing mode confusion. These results provide strong empirical evidence that leveraging Naive S2-Guidance can significantly enhance both the quality and robustness of conditional generation. 3.3 S2-GUIDANCE IS SUFFICIENT However, Naive S2-Guidance incurs significant computational overhead, which severely limits its practicality. In the process of constructing sub-networks, we find that constraining stochastic blockdropping within specific range allows sub-networks, even those generated by dropping at different blocks, to consistently guide the model toward the ideal distribution (see results in Appendix A). Therefore, we propose simplified approach: performing single stochastic block-dropping operation at each timestep for self guidance. We refer to this approach as S2-Guidance, which achieves"

We empirically validate the proposed S2-Guidance on toy examples with 1D and 2D Gaussian mixture data, as well as on real-world datasets. As shown in Figure 3 (e), S2-Guidance performs comparably to Naive S2-Guidance. On both 1D and 2D Gaussian mixture distributions, it produces results that closely align with the ideal distribution, while exhibiting efficiency without significant degradation. Moreover, as illustrated in Figure 4 (e, f), S2-Guidance achieves highly competitive performance on real-world datasets, highlighting its practical effectiveness. To further analyze the stochastic block-dropping strategy, we conduct detailed experimental study in Section 4.4. Our empirical analysis reveals that, when the block drop ratio is maintained around 10% of the networks blocks, the resulting sub-networks consistently enable the model to achieve better performance. This strategy proves effective across mainstream DiT Peebles & Xie (2023a) architectures, leveraging the redundancy in the outputs to dynamically construct diverse stochastic sub-networks. Unlike explicitly constructed weak models, which once selected affect the entire denoising process, stochastic block-dropping enables the creation of sub-networks independently at different timesteps. This dynamic diversity introduces self-guidance throughout the diffusion process, allowing predictions to evolve iteratively and steering the outputs toward higher-quality results."

In contrast, our method produces higher-quality images with finer details and better semantic alignment to the text descriptions. 4.3 TEXT-TO-VIDEO GENERATION Quantitative Evaluation. The quantitative results in Table 2 validate our methods superiority. On the Wan1.3B model, S2-Guidance achieves the highest Total Score (80.93), outperforming all baselines. Notably, it surpasses recent strong competitors like CFG++ and CFG-Zero, while significantly outperforming methods like APG, which struggles with overall quality. We further conduct experiments on the larger Wan14b model, demonstrating significant improvements compared to CFG. Qualitative Evaluation. As visually demonstrated in Figure 6, our method generates videos with substantially improved quality and coherence. The examples highlight that S2-Guidance effectively addresses two critical failures of original CFG: the loss of physical plausibility in object motion and the inability to adhere to complex, compositional prompts. Consequently, our approach yields videos that are not only more physically realistic but also demonstrate superior prompt coherence, faithfully realizing the users creative intent. User Study. We performed user study for both T2I and T2V generation. Our method is significantly preferred over all baselines in terms of both visual quality and prompt alignment. Full details are presented in Appendix B. 4.4 ABLATION STUDY Performance under Different Guidance Scales. We conduct experiments to compare S2Guidance with CFG across various guidance scales, focusing on aesthetic and CLIP scores. As shown in Figure 7, S2-Guidance consistently outperforms CFG across wide range of scales. Unlike CFG, which requires extensive parameter tuning, S2-Guidance exhibits stability and achieves high performance with minimal sensitivity to guidance scales. Notably, in most cases, S2-Guidance even surpasses the best performance achieved by CFG, demonstrating its robustness."

Right: Analysis of the impact of our S2 Scale (Ï) on aesthetic scores. Effect of S2 Scale Ï. We conduct experiments to analyze S2 Scale Ï , as shown in Figure 7. When Ï is set to smaller value, it improves the aesthetic score. However, since CFG has already produced suboptimal result, using larger Ï tends to overadjust, leading to decline in quality. Effect of Drop-Ratio. We investigate the impact of the drop-ratio on the SD3.5 model with 24 blocks. As shown in Table 3 (left), when the number of dropped blocks is limited to 3/24 (approximately 10%), the aesthetic score remains stable at relatively high level. However, dropping more blocks leads to gradual decline in performance. Empirically, we find that drop-ratio of about 10% effectively simulates the predictions of weaker model, enabling the improvement of suboptimal results produced by CFG. Comparative Analysis of S2-Guidance and Naive S2-Guidance. As shown in Table 3 (right), increasing the number of iterations for sampling stochastic subnetworks during self-guidance yields diminishing improvements in aesthetic scores. S2-Guidance also effectively enhances fidelity in reconstruction tasks. For more theoretical and experimental analysis, see Appendix A.

            "content": "A.1 PRINCIPLED DERIVATION OF NAIVE S2-GUIDANCE FROM BAYESIAN PERSPECTIVE In this subsection, we provide principled theoretical foundation for our proposed Naive Stochastic Sub-network Guidance (Naive S2-Guidance) method. We move beyond heuristic interpretation and formally derive our approach by drawing direct line to the principles of Bayesian inference, as established in the seminal work Dropout as Bayesian Approximation by Gal & Ghahramani (2016). Our central argument is that Naive S2-Guidance is not merely inspired by Bayesian ideas, but can be derived as principled mechanism for correcting the predictions of deterministic model by leveraging its own epistemic uncertainty. (cid:90) A.1.1 FOUNDATIONAL BAYESIAN FORMULATION Let = {xi, ci}M i=1 be our training dataset. fully Bayesian approach to generative modeling would seek to compute the true posterior predictive distribution for new sample xt given condition c: p(Dxt, c, D) = p(Dxt, c, Î¸)p(Î¸D)dÎ¸, (5) where Î¸ Î are the model parameters, p(Î¸D) is the true posterior distribution over these parameters, and p(Dxt, c, Î¸) is the likelihood of specific prediction given parameters Î¸. The true posterior is given by Bayes theorem: Î p(Î¸D) = p(DÎ¸)p(Î¸) p(D) = p(DÎ¸)p(Î¸) Î p(DÎ¸)p(Î¸)dÎ¸ . (cid:82) (6) The integral in the denominator, known as the marginal likelihood or model evidence, is intractable for deep neural networks. To circumvent this, we employ Variational Inference (VI), introducing tractable approximate posterior distribution qÏ(Î¸) (parameterized by Ï) to approximate p(Î¸D). We minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these two distributions: Ï = arg min Ï KL(qÏ(Î¸)p(Î¸D)) = arg min Ï = arg min Ï = arg min Ï (cid:90) (cid:90) qÏ(Î¸) log qÏ(Î¸) log dÎ¸ qÏ(Î¸) p(Î¸D) qÏ(Î¸)p(D) p(DÎ¸)p(Î¸) dÎ¸ (cid:0)KL(qÏ(Î¸)p(Î¸)) EqÏ(Î¸)[log p(DÎ¸)](cid:1) . (7) (8) (9) (10) Minimizing this objective is equivalent to maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), LELBO. The work of Gal & Ghahramani (2016) provides the theoretical grounding for interpreting stochastic network perturbations, such as dropout, as form of this Bayesian optimization. In our work, we generalize this concept from neuron-level dropout to block-level dropout. Each binary mask mi p(m) applied via stochastic block dropping effectively samples specific set of weights Î¸i = Î¸ mi from this approximate posterior, which we denote simply as q(Î¸). A.1.2 MONTE CARLO ESTIMATION OF THE APPROXIMATE POSTERIOR PREDICTIVE The prediction of single sub-network, ËDÎ¸(xt c, mi), is thus legitimate sample from the approximate posterior predictive distribution, pq(Dxt, c): ËDÎ¸(xt c, mi) D(xt c; Î¸i), where Î¸i q(Î¸). (11) The moments of this distribution can be estimated via Monte Carlo integration. The first moment, the posterior mean Âµpost, is defined and approximated as: Âµpost(xt c) Eq(Î¸)[D(xt c; Î¸)] = (cid:90) D(xt c; Î¸)q(Î¸)dÎ¸ ËDÎ¸(xt c, mi). (12) 1 N (cid:88) i="

(13) i=1 Our central hypothesis is that low-quality generative outputs often arise in regions of high epistemic uncertainty. In such regions, the posterior mean, Âµpost, often corresponds to safe, but ultimately low-quality output (e.g., blurry artifact). The deterministic MAP estimate, DÎ¸(xt c), however, might be unjustifiably confident in these very regions. A.1.3 DERIVING S2-GUIDANCE AS AN UNCERTAINTY-AWARE CORRECTION Based on this hypothesis, we formulate principled correction to the Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) prediction, DCFG. The standard guidance is: DCFG(xt c) = DÎ¸(xt Ï) + Î»(cid:0)DÎ¸(xt c) DÎ¸(xt Ï)(cid:1). (14) Î¸ We define our corrected prediction, DÎ»,Ï (xt c), as the solution to an optimization problem where we seek prediction that remains faithful to the original guidance while being repelled from the center of uncertainty. Let us define correction vector D. We propose that this correction should be in the direction opposite to the posterior mean, which acts as the locus of uncertainty-induced artifacts: Ï Âµpost(xt c), (15) where Ï is scalar controlling the magnitude of the repulsion. The corrected prediction is thus the linear superposition of the original guidance and this correction term: DÎ»,Ï Î¸ (xt c) DCFG(xt c) + D, = DCFG(xt c) Ï Âµpost(xt c), = DÎ¸(xt Ï) + Î»(cid:0)DÎ¸(xt c) DÎ¸(xt Ï)(cid:1) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) Standard CFG Ï Eq(Î¸)[D(xt c; Î¸)] (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:124) Uncertainty-Aware Repulsion Term . (16) (17) (18) Substituting the Monte Carlo approximation from Eq. 12 into Eq. 16, we recover our full Naive S2-Guidance formulation: DÎ»,Ï Î¸ (xt c) = DÎ¸(xt Ï) + Î»(cid:0)DÎ¸(xt c) DÎ¸(xt Ï)(cid:1) Ï (cid:88) i= ËDÎ¸(xt c, mi). (19) A.1.4 THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION AND DECOMPOSITIONS This derivation provides much deeper understanding of Naive S2-Guidance. Decomposition of Predictive Components. We can rearrange Eq. 18 to analyze the contribution of each component to the final prediction: DÎ»,Ï Î¸ (xt c) = (1 Î»)DÎ¸(xt Ï) + Î»DÎ¸(xt c) Ï Âµpost(xt c) = Î»DÎ¸(xt c) (cid:124) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) MAP Guidance Ï Âµpost(xt c) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:124) Bayesian Correction (cid:124) + (1 Î»)DÎ¸(xt Ï) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) Unconditional Prior . (20) (21) This shows clear trade-off: we leverage the strong guidance from the conditional MAP estimate (DÎ¸(xt c)) and the unconditional prior (DÎ¸(xt Ï)), but temper both with Bayesian correction term that represents the consensus of diverse committee of model hypotheses. It acts to regularize the overconfidence of the single MAP estimate."

            "content": "Figure 8: Aesthetic score gains brought by increasing the number of forward passes with stochastic block dropping at each time step. Gradient-Space Perspective. In diffusion models, the guidance is applied in the noise prediction space. Let ÏµÎ¸(xt, c) be the models noise prediction. The standard CFG-guided noise ÏµCFG is: ÏµCFG(xt, c) = ÏµÎ¸(xt, Ï) + Î»(ÏµÎ¸(xt, c) ÏµÎ¸(xt, Ï)). (22) Our method introduces correction term directly in this space. Let Ïµpost(xt, c) = Eq(Î¸)[ÏµÎ¸(xt, c; Î¸)] be the posterior mean of the noise prediction. Our corrected noise prediction becomes: ÏµS2G(xt, c) = ÏµCFG(xt, c) Ï Ïµpost(xt, c) = ÏµCFG(xt, c) Ï (cid:32) 1 (cid:88) i=1 (cid:33) ÏµÎ¸(xt, c; Î¸i) . (23) (24) This reveals that Naive S2-Guidance is performing direct modification of the guidance vector at each step of the denoising process. The repulsion from the center of uncertainty is not an abstract concept but concrete vector subtraction in the high-dimensional noise space. Connection to Negative Ensemble Distillation. Our method can be framed as novel form of negative distillation applied at inference time. Standard ensemble distillation trains single model to mimic the average output of an ensemble. In contrast, Naive S2-Guidance uses the ensembles average prediction (Âµpost) not as target to be imitated, but as an anti-target to be actively repelled. This distillation-rejection mechanism is new and principled way to harness the wisdom of an ensemble without collapsing to its mean. In summary, Naive S2-Guidance is theoretically grounded method that leverages the principles of Bayesian model averaging and uncertainty quantification. It operationalizes the insight that highquality generation requires not only strong conditional guidance but also mechanism to actively avoid regions of high model uncertainty. Our derivation shows that subtracting the Monte Carlo average of stochastic sub-networks is direct and principled way to implement this avoidance, thereby correcting for the inherent limitations of single, deterministic generative model, as shown in Figure 9. A.2 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF S2-GUIDANCE AND NAIVE S2-GUIDANCE Our investigation into the behavior of sub-networks reveals crucial property. We find that when the stochastic block-dropping ratio is constrained within specific range, the guidance provided by different sub-networks appears remarkably consistent. As illustrated in Figure 10, even when"

            "content": "different blocks are dropped to form distinct sub-network configurations, their individual guidance effects on the models output distribution exhibit strong similarity. This consistent behavior is the key observation that motivates our simplification. If different, randomly drawn sub-networks provide qualitatively similar guidance, it suggests potential redundancy in the Naive S2-Guidance approach, which meticulously averages the predictions of many such subnetworks. This insight inspires us to seek plausible theoretical connection that would allow us to avoid the significant computational overhead of the naive method without sacrificing guidance quality. compelling theoretical lens through which to view this observed redundancy is the principle of unbiased estimation. Let us formalize the guidance terms. The computationally expensive guidance in Naive S2-Guidance can be seen as Monte Carlo approximation of posterior mean: GNaive = Ï Âµpost(xt c) Ï (cid:88) i=1 ËDÎ¸(xt c, mi). (25) In contrast, our simplified S2-Guidance employs stochastic guidance term from single sample: GS2-Guidance = Ï ËDÎ¸(xt c, mt), where mt p(m). We posit that the relationship between these two can be understood by considering GS2-Guidance as an approximate unbiased estimator of the expected guidance GNaive. If this holds, the expectation of the single-sample stochastic guidance over all possible masks would be equivalent to the full-batch guidance term: (26) Ep(mt)[GS2-Guidance] = Ep(mt)[Ï ËDÎ¸(xt c, mt)] = Ï Ep(mt)[ ËDÎ¸(xt c, mt)] Ï Âµpost(xt c) E[GNaive]. (27) (28) (29) This theoretical framing, while not strict proof, offers powerful rationale for our observations. It suggests that while the guidance from any single sub-network (GS2-Guidance) is stochastic, its direction, on average, should align with the stable guidance provided by the full ensemble (GNaive). This perspective provides solid theoretical motivation for why different sub-networks can guide the model consistently towards the same ideal distribution, as seen in our experiments. Therefore, our simplification from Naive S2-Guidance to S2-Guidance can be viewed not as an ad-hoc heuristic, but as principled step motivated by stochastic approximation theory. Further experiments, such as repeating the process with small number of samples (as shown in Figure 8), corroborate this perspective by demonstrating diminishing returns. This confirms the practical sufficiency of single stochastic sample, especially when its effect is temporally integrated over the diffusion trajectory."

The figure illustrates that while standard CFG and Autoguidance improve upon the unguided baseline, their final predictions consistently deviate from the distributions centered at -4 and 4. This visually demonstrates the mode-shifting problem discussed in the main paper. In stark contrast, the paths for both Naive SÂ²-Guidance and our final SÂ²-Guidance method are more direct and successfully converge to the correct endpoints. This suggests that our self-guidance signal effectively corrects the generation path at each timestep, preventing the model from settling in the suboptimal regions favored by other methods. B.1.2 NAIVE S2-GUIDANCE VERSUS S2-GUIDANCE IN TOY EXAMPLES In our methodology, we first proposed Naive SÂ²-Guidance, which averages the predictions from multiple stochastic sub-networks to create robust negative guidance signal. However, this approach carries significant computational cost. To address this, we introduced our final, more efficient SÂ²Guidance, which uses only single stochastic sub-network per timestep."

Each panel shows the paths taken by different guidance methods to generate samples targeting the ground truth modes at -4 and 4. The y-axis represents the denoising timestep (from start to end), and the x-axis shows the predicted sample value. While standard CFG and Autoguidance improve upon the unguided baseline, they consistently fail to reach the ground truth. In contrast, both Naive SÂ²Guidance and our final SÂ²-Guidance method successfully steer the generation process to the correct endpoints. The more direct paths of our methods indicate more efficient and accurate guidance signal throughout the entire denoising process. To validate that this simplification does not cause meaningful performance degradation, we conduct direct comparison on the 2D Gaussian mixture. As illustrated in Figure 10, the sample distributions generated by both methods are qualitatively indistinguishable across multiple independent runs. Both approaches effectively guide the generation process to the correct modes and prevent the mode collapse issues seen in standard CFG (see Figure 3 in the main paper). Given the negligible difference in performance, the substantial computational advantage of SÂ²Guidance makes it the far more practical and efficient choice. This finding strongly supports our adoption of the simplified approach as our final method. B.1.3 DETAILS OF TOY EXAMPLES Below are the implementation details for the experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, as referenced in the main paper. All experiments were conducted using class-balanced datasets to assess the performance of our method. 1-D Bimodal Gaussian Distribution: This experiment was designed to test the models ability to stably and completely capture both modes of bimodal distribution. The groundtruth data is an equally-weighted mixture of two Gaussians. The diffusion model, parameterized by standard neural network, was trained for iterations to reconstruct the target distribution. Analysis involved visualizing the final sample distribution and denoising trajectories to show that S2-Guidance consistently covers both modes, whereas the baseline may exhibit instability or mode preference (see Figure 3 in the main paper). 2-D Gaussian Mixture (4-Modes): This experiment assessed the models capacity to generate samples from disconnected, multi-modal manifold. The data consisted of an equally-weighted mixture of 4 isotropic Gaussians, with means located at (4, 4), (4, 4), (4, 4), and (4, 4). The analysis focused on the final distribution and denoising paths to demonstrate that S2-Guidance successfully captures all 4 distinct modes, improving upon the baselines mode coverage. Real-Image Data (CIFAR-10): To validate S2-Guidance on high-dimensional data, we used class-balanced dataset from CIFAR-10, consisting of 5,000 horse images and"

The resulting plot demonstrates that S2-Guidance produces more distinct and well-separated class clusters compared to the baseline, indicating higher-quality and less ambiguous generations (see Figure 4 in the main paper). B.2 EXTENDED EVALUATIONS In addition to the main experiments conducted with SD3 and SD3.5, we further evaluate our method using Flux, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for text-to-image generation. Note that Flux is CFGdistilled model, meaning that directly applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) may lead to different results. We use De-distilled version of Flux Labs (2024) in our experiments.

These comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach across various scenarios. B.3 USER STUDY To quantitatively evaluate the perceptual quality and prompt fidelity of our method, we conducted comprehensive user study comparing S2-Guidance against four strong baselines: CFG Ho & Salimans (2022), APG Sadat et al. (2024a), CFG++ Chung et al. (2024), and CFG-Zero Fan et al. (2025). The evaluation was performed on images generated from diverse set of diffusion models to assess the generalizability of our approach. We recruited 14 participants with expertise in computer vision and generative AI. For each evaluation instance, participants were presented with text prompt and the corresponding images generated by all five methods, displayed in randomized order to prevent bias. Participants were instructed to evaluate the results based on three key criteria: Detail Preservation: The clarity, sharpness, and richness of details in the generated image. Color Consistency: The naturalness, harmony, and realism of the colors. Image-Text Alignment: How well the generated image accurately reflects the content and intent of the text prompt. For each criterion, participants were asked to select the image (or images) they found to be the most successful. This design allows for multiple selections if participant deems more than one result to be of high quality for given aspect, thereby capturing more nuanced assessment of performance. The results of the user study are presented in Figure 11. The findings demonstrate clear and consistent preference for our proposed method, S2-Guidance, across all evaluated metrics. Specifically, in the Detail Preservation category, S2-Guidance was preferred in 32.5% of cases, significantly outperforming the runner-up, CFG (18.3%). similar dominant trend is observed for Color Consistency, where S2-Guidance achieved 29.6% preference rate. Furthermore, for Image-Text Alignment, our method was chosen 31.1% of the time, again marking substantial lead over all baselines. Aggregating the votes, the Overall preference for S2-Guidance stands at 31.0%, confirming its comprehensive superiority. This strong performance in human evaluations validates that S2-Guidance not only improves guidance from theoretical standpoint but also translates to tangible and perceptually superior generation quality that is easily recognized by human users."
