            "content": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) [5, 8, 20, 25, 50, 55] demonstrate significant promise in advancing multimodal perception, understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Recently, some specialized embodied VLMs have emerged in domains such as autonomous driving and embodied AI, highlighting their interactions with the physical world [21, 27, 35, 49, 50]. Specifically, specialized VLMs for embodied AI, such as RoboBrain [27, 49] and VeBrain [35], emphasize individual capabilities like task planning and spatial understanding, delivering critical information for robots during physical interactions. Similarly, specialized VLMs in autonomous driving, such as RoboTron-Drive [24] and DriveLMM-o1 [26], focus on enhancing specific aspects of driving performance, including environmental perception, status prediction, and driving planning, providing necessary information support for autonomous driving systems. While these specialized embodied VLMs have made significant progress, they are constrained by their narrowly defined application scenarios. The focus of embodied AI on indoor tasks and autonomous driving on outdoor roads creates significant domain gap, which hinders the cross-domain generalization of capabilities. We summarize the challenges faced by specialized embodied VLMs as follows: (1) Lack of Unified Embodied VLMs. Existing VLMs focus on single domain and lack unified VLM that bridges autonomous driving and embodied AI. This fragmentation hinders the generalization of spatial understanding and reasoning across diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios, ultimately limiting the models capability to interact effectively with the physical world in dynamic environments. (2) Absence of Comprehensive Cross-Embodiment Capability Evaluation. Existing VLMs only assess partial capabilities in either autonomous driving or embodied AI, lacking comprehensive cross-embodiment capability evaluation to assess the overall performance of specialized embodied VLMs. To address these challenges, we present MiMo-Embodied, unified VLM that merges the tasks of autonomous driving and embodied AI into single model. To our knowledge, MiMo-Embodied is the first open-source VLM to integrate these critical areas, significantly enhancing understanding and reasoning in dynamic physical environments. To evaluate MiMo-Embodied, we conduct series of comprehensive cross-embodiment capability benchmarks to assess the overall performance of specialized embodied VLMs. As shown in Figure 2, our MiMoEmbodied model focuses on key capabilities in both autonomous driving and embodied AI. For autonomous driving, we evaluate three core capabilities: (1) Environmental Perception: understanding traffic scenes through semantic and geometric analysis to scene comprehension, region-level interpretation and potential hazards detection; (2) Status Prediction: forecasting the behaviors of agents and multi-agent interactions to facilitate proactive decision-making; and (3) Driving Planning: generating safe driving maneuvers with explainable justifications based on traffic logic, ensuring compliance with road rules while optimizing safety and efficiency. For embodied AI, we evaluate three core capabilities: (1) Affordance Prediction: inferring actionable interaction possibilities from visual scenes to enable effective interactions; (2) Task Planning: translating abstract instructions into executable action sequences for accomplishing specific goals; and (3) Spatial Understanding: reasoning about spatial relationships, including directions, distances, and layouts, to facilitate navigation and interaction within the environment. Finally, MiMo-Embodied not only advances the state of specialized embodied VLMs but also sets new standard for integrating diverse competencies, paving the way for more intelligent and adaptable systems in complex real-world applications. To equip MiMo-Embodied with the capability to handle both embodied AI and autonomous driving tasks, we constructed diverse dataset of spanning general visual-language understanding, embodied tasks, and autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset provides the multimodal foundation for MiMo-Embodieds core capabilities in perception, prediction, and planning for both autonomous driving and embodied AI. Based on the constructed dataset, we develop progressive four-stage training strategy, which is critical to achieving state-of-the-art performance. The training stages comprises: Stage 1: General and Embodied Knowledge Learning establish core affordance understanding, high-level task planning, and spatial reasoning abilities based on general visual knowledge. Stage 2: Autonomous Driving Knowledge Learning integrates cross-domain understanding through mixed supervision from both autonomous driving and embodied data. Stage 3: Chain-of-Thought Fine-tuning enhances complex reasoning by incorporating generated rationales. Stage 4: Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning further refines task-specific performance via GRPO [19] optimization. Extensive evaluations demonstrate MiMo-Embodieds strength on 17 benchmarks in embodied AI, and leading performance across 12 benchmarks in autonomous driving, which outperforms current open-source and closed-source general VLMs, as well as specialized models. 3 Figure 2 Overview of MiMo-Embodied Capabilities. MiMo-Embodied supports both Autonomous Driving and Embodied AI tasks, featuring 12 benchmarks in Autonomous Driving that cover Environmental Perception, Status Prediction and Driving Planning, along with 17 benchmarks in Embodied AI tasks focusing on Affordance Prediction, Task Planning, and Spatial Understanding. This report offers comprehensive overview of the development of MiMo-Embodied, including its model architecture, pretraining dataset, training strategy, benchmark evaluation results, and application cases. The remaining sections of this report are organized as follows: Section 2 details the model architecture, establishing the foundation for our unified framework. Section 3 outlines the data curation and construction process across three categories: general multimodal understanding, embodied AI, and autonomous driving. Section 4 elaborates on the four-stage training strategy, which is crucial to achieving our state-of-the-art performance. Section 5 presents comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results, validating the superior performance of our model across various domains."

To effectively process high-resolution inputs, we adopt the vision encoder from MiMo-VL [59]. Similarly, the LLM backbone and the projector are initialized using their respective pre-trained weights from MiMo-VL [59], inheriting its established vision-language alignment and powerful reasoning capabilities. The projector is implemented using multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which maps visual tokens to the LLMs input space. The overall architecture of MiMo-Embodied is shown in Figure 3."

            "content": "To establish comprehensive understanding of affordance, we collect data from the following sources: PixMoPoints [13], RoboAfford [48], and RoboRefIt [34]. PixMo-Points PixMo-Points [13] provides large-scale collection of diverse web images specifically designed to enhance the models ability to perform fine-grained localization through natural language queries. It supports two core capabilities: (1) Object Counting by Pointing, where the model enumerates instances by sequentially pointing to each occurrence, and (2) Visual Explanation via Pointing, where the model grounds its answers by referring to relevant regions in the image. By training on PixMo-Points, the model learns to associate linguistic expressions with precise spatial locations, improving both referential clarity and interactive capabilities. RoboAfford RoboAfford [48] is unified affordance-centric dataset systematically structured to address both object-level and scene-level interaction reasoning. It covers the following five task categories: (1) Visual Captioning: generating contextual descriptions of scenes and objects; (2) Visual Grounding: establishing correspondences between language descriptions and object locations using bounding boxes; (3) Pointing: identifying objects based on category and attribute descriptions; (4) Object Affordance Grounding and 6 Pointing: localizing functional parts of objects such as handles or graspable areas using both bounding boxes and points; and (5) Spatial Affordance Localization: identifying suitable placement regions in free space or on supporting surfaces to facilitate object manipulation. This multi-task setup enables the model to reason about not only what actions an object affords, but also where those actions can be executed. RoboRefIt Beyond object pointing and functional grounding, referential understanding in spatially complex settings is essential for embodied interaction. To this end, we incorporate RoboRefIt [34], dataset featuring referring expressions collected from 187 cluttered indoor scenes. RoboRefIt emphasizes challenging visual grounding scenarios with multiple instances of the same object category, requiring the model to resolve referential ambiguity through attributes and spatial relations. Its annotations include both 2D bounding boxes and segmentation masks, supporting tasks such as referring expression comprehension (REC) and segmentation (RES). By integrating RoboRefIt, the model strengthens its ability to interpret language directives in context-rich, multi-object environments."

            "content": "To advance the capabilities of multimodal models in embodied reasoning and long-horizon task planning, we construct comprehensive task planning dataset by processing and integrating three key sources: CosmosReason1 [3], EgoPlan-IT [10], and RoboVQA [45]. Cosmos-Reason1 The Cosmos-Reason1 [3] component forms the foundation of planning dataset, providing large-scale collection focused on grounding language in physical reality. We specifically leverage its data derived from BridgeData V2 [52], RoboVQA [45], AgiBot [6], and HoloAssist [57], which together cover wide spectrum of embodiments, including robot arms, humanoid robots, and human activities. The data is structured into two complementary annotation types: (1) Understanding Annotations: These provide dense, structured captions for video clips, detailing objects, their attributes, states, and the actions being performed. This serves as the foundational visual context. (2) Reasoning Annotations: This subset includes complex questions accompanied by long-chain reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1 [19], which require multi-step physical and embodied reasoning beyond simple caption understanding. We filter out short videos and use longer videos for training. This dataset equips our model with robust understanding of intuitive physics and cross-embodiment reasoning, enabling the model to perform task completion verification, action affordance judgment, and next-action prediction for variety of agents. EgoPlan-IT To equip the model with human-like planning from first-person perspective, we incorporate high-quality subset of EgoPlan-IT [10]. This dataset is built upon large-scale egocentric video datasets (Epic-Kitchens [11], Ego4D [18]), mirroring how humans perceive and interact with the world. Each sample is structured as multiple-choice question that encapsulates real-world planning problem. The input includes current observation image with task goal described in open-form language, and video clip showing the historical progress of the task. The model is required to predict the correct next action plan from set of candidate options, which include the ground-truth action and several carefully selected negative answers derived from the same task goal. RoboVQA To enhance long-horizon reasoning, we integrate data from RoboVQA [45] including ten types of QA pairs that are automatically generated from long-horizon activity sequences. This component is vital for training models on broad range of visual question-answering tasks that are fundamental to robotics."

These datasets provide rich supervision for understanding object relationships in 3D space, interpreting scene layouts, and responding to complex spatial queries, thereby forming foundational pillar for tasks requiring spatial awareness. The data are collected from the following datasets: SQA3D and Self-curated Data We utilize SQA3D [36] and curated 3D dataset for 3D Question Answering (3D-QA), task requiring holistic 3D scene understanding from textual questions. To advance this paradigm, we introduce 3D bounding box localization. Our data combines questions with calibrated images and 7 camera parameters, supporting diverse challenges from object attributes to inter-object spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we generate large-scale 3D grounding data from existing datasets, where each sample includes an RGB image with spatial query, requiring the model to regress 3D boxes in camera coordinate system. This diverse collection, spanning various scenes and object scales, provides crucial supervision for monocular 3D understanding and domain generalization. VLM-3R We utilize spatial reasoning and navigation QA pairs from the VLM-3R [16] dataset, which extends the VSI-Bench [61] framework with large-scale automated generation of spatio-temporal questionanswer pairs. The data encompass seven core spatial reasoning tasks and embodied route planning, each sample combining egocentric video inputs with questions about 3D object relations and navigational actions. RefSpatial To enhance spatial reasoning capabilities for robotic referring tasks, we select samples from RefSpatial [69] dataset. This collection focuses on spatial understanding tasks including object localization, spatial relation comprehension, and free-space identification for placement. The dataset features multi-modal RGB-D inputs paired with textual instructions requiring precise 2D coordinate predictions. Each sample contains multi-turn conversations that progressively address spatial constraints, supporting both single-step perception and multi-step reasoning. The data format integrates visual grounding with structured responses, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial relationships essential for real-world robotic interaction. EmbSpatial To enhance spatial reasoning capabilities in embodied scenarios, we employ data from EmbSpatialSFT [15], which comprise spatial relationship identification and object localization tasks.

To fulfill this objective, the relevant data not only encompass both panoramic overviews and local specifics but also demonstrate multi-level capabilities, including information comprehension and target localization. General Scene Understanding As core component, its primary function is to holistically describe the overall context of the driving scenario and identify key environmental and traffic elements within it. This task aims to build macro-level environmental cognition, distinguishing scenario types and identifying large-scale traffic components. Specifically, CODA-LM [9] includes general perception subtask that focuses on understanding key road entities in driving scenarios, covering the appearance and location of these entities, as well as the reasons why they influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. scenery dataset proposed in prior research [38] incorporates annotations across roughly 15 different categories. These categories cover driver actions, justifications, attention, observations of vehicles, observations of pedestrians, road elements, and environmental details. Building on nuScenes, DriveLM [46] generates identify questions related to objects and traffic elements. Similarly, related research [53] generates QA pairs that cover comprehensive range of perception and understanding tasks for driving scenarios, encompassing core dimensions to fully address the understanding of scenario descriptions and key attention elements: it includes scene description, identifying close objects, identifying threatening traffic elements, object countings, recognition of object color and relative position, and OCR-type tasks. nuScenes-QA [41] generates scene graphs using existing 3D detection annotations and manually designs question templates to support the generation of general perception data. MME-RealWorld [68] emphasizes key tasks including object identification, object counting, and driver attention understanding, while IDKB [33] specializes in encoding knowledge related to traffic laws and regulations, providing regulatory foundation for interpreting scenario elements and their implications for driving behavior. MAPLM [7] focuses on road-centric analysis tasks, covering road scene understanding, point 8 cloud quality analysis, road intersection recognition, lane counting, and road and lane description. Collectively, these datasets contribute to multi-faceted understanding of driving scenarios. Regional Object Understanding As object-level perception task, its core objective is to enable fine-grained QA interactions for specific target objects within driving scenarios, focusing on detailed recognition, attribute analysis, and behavioral impact interpretation of localized objects. This involves not only detailed recognition of these objects but also in-depth attribute analysis and interpretation of their behavioral impacts. Specifically, CODA-LM [9] is designed to understand corner-case objects in scenarios where specific bounding boxes are provided. Beyond simply describing the objects within these predefined bounding boxes, it delves into elaborating on the specific mechanisms through which these often rare or high-risk objects influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. DriveLM [46] concentrates on two key aspects of localized traffic elements: it supports both traffic elements visual description, which captures static attributes such as shape, color, and texture, and traffic elements motion State, which analyzes dynamic characteristics like speed, direction, and acceleration. DriveAction [22] enriches regional object understanding with 14 vision and language tasks. These tasks cover wide range of aspects, including road structure details, traffic sign attributes, and both dynamic and static traffic elements. MME-RealWorld [68] focus on critical dynamic and attribute tasks. These include pedestrians and vehicles motion attribute identification and traffic signal attribute identification. nuScenes-QA [41]enhances object-centric QA by supporting three core tasks: object recognition, which confirms object categories; object status, which assesses states such as stopped; and objects comparison, for example, judging which vehicle is closer to the ego car. Complementing these, IDKB [33] provides knowledge support specific to the autonomous driving domain by encoding detailed information about road signs, traffic signals, and lane markings. This knowledge base serves as foundation for interpreting the semantic meaning of regional objects and how these objects regulate driving decisions. Collectively, these datasets form comprehensive framework for Regional Object Understanding, enabling precise, targeted analysis of localized objects in driving scenarios that also takes context into account. Regional Object Localization object-level positioning task, its core objective is to achieve accurate target detection for critical objects that influence driving decisions in driving scenarios, rather than detecting all objects without distinction. It focuses on locking the spatial positions of critical objects and outputting positioning information applicable to subsequent decision-making, thereby providing fundamental support for key links of autonomous driving systems. This task not only requires accurately identifying the categories of critical objects from complex driving environment but also demands clarifying their specific positions. Specifically, related work [37] is representative dataset in this task field. Its core function is to identify critical objects in driving scenarios and output corresponding 2D coordinates. Unlike conventional datasets that seek comprehensiveness in object detection, it focuses on objects that directly impact driving decisions, such as sudden obstacles, important traffic signs, and pedestrians crossing the road."

By analyzing historical motion data, current states, and contextual information of traffic elements, this task enables autonomous driving systems to proactively anticipate potential action trendssuch as whether preceding vehicle will turn, pedestrian will cross the road, or an adjacent vehicle will change lanesthereby laying critical foundation for safe path planning, collision avoidance, and adaptive speed adjustment. This task not only requires capturing short-term motion patterns of traffic elements but also demands integrating environmental context to improve the accuracy and robustness of behavior predictions, effectively reducing the uncertainty of autonomous driving systems in complex interaction scenarios. Specifically, DriveLM [46] serves as dataset for advancing intent prediction, with dual focus on two critical aspects of traffic element behavior analysis. First, it supports traffic elements motion prediction, which models the future motion of traffic elements based on multi-frame sequential data. Second, it emphasizes object interaction between traffic elements, capturing the interdependencies between different traffic participants. Complementing DriveLM, MME-Realworld [68] focuses on enhancing the practicality of intent prediction in real-world driving environments, with dedicated emphasis on traffic elements intention prediction. These datasets form complementary framework for intent prediction in autonomous driving."

For this task, two key requirements must be met: the predicted meta actions need to align with real-world traffic rules, and multiple objectives such as safety priority and driving efficiency must be balanced. Specifically, DriveLM [46] focus on two critical dimensions of ego vehicle meta action prediction. First, it supports the classification of safe or unsafe action by labeling whether the ego vehicles potential meta actions conform to safety standards. Second, it emphasizes the definition of goal action, which associates meta actions with specific driving goals. MME-Realworld [68] focuses on enhancing the adaptability of action decision in real-world scenarios, with dedicated emphasis on ego intention prediction. This dataset is built on large number of real driving cases that cover urban, suburban and highway scenarios. In addition, IDKB [33] provides critical knowledge support for action decision by integrating information on vehicle control and driving techniques. These datasets collectively form complementary framework for action decision in autonomous driving, covering safety validation, goal alignment, real-scenario adaptation, and control knowledge integration. Driving Reasoning Different from action decision, driving reasoning is to predict the ego vehicles driving decisions while explicitly outputting the corresponding reasoning process. This task aims to build interpretable decision-making cognition, not only determining the optimal driving actions for the ego vehicle but also clarifying the logical basis behind decisions such as how environmental factors, traffic rules, and safety priorities jointly guide the generation of specific decisionsthereby enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of autonomous driving systems. Specifically, multiple datasets focus on the integration of decision suggestion and reasoning explanation for Driving Reasoning. CODA-LM [9] supports the task of formulating driving advice, which requires models to first accurately perceive both the general context and regional details of the current driving environment, then provide the ego vehicle with optimal driving suggestions while implicitly embedding the reasoning logic in the advice. Nuinstruct [14] complements this by focusing on high-level decision-making and safety reasoning. novel dataset [38] is built from recorded driving sessions featuring notable events that trigger changes in the cars behaviorincluding decelerations, accelerations, lane changes, narrow gap passes, and turns. Each event is paired with two key pieces of information: descriptions of the cars current action and the corresponding justification for that action. Related work [31] extends this to video-based scenarios: given driving video clip, it requires models to output the ego vehicles specific action and the corresponding reasoning. DriveLM [46] provides comprehensive support for driving reasoning through its planning and reasoning task. IDKB [33] strengthens the reasoning foundation by specializing in encoding knowledge related to driver responsibility and defensive driving. Collectively, these datasets form multi-faceted framework for driving reasoning in autonomous driving, and this framework covers decision-advice reasoning, event-justification matching, and knowledge-guided logical analysis."

The results in Table 2 and Table 3 show that MiMo-Embodied delivers competitive results, showing particular strength in affordance prediction and spatial understanding compared to both general-purpose multimodal models and specialized embodied models. Affordance Prediction Capability We evaluate the models ability to infer actionable interaction possibilities from visual scenes using five specialized benchmarks, each targeting distinct aspect of affordance understanding. Roborefit [34] assesses object reference capabilities in robotic manipulation scenarios, specifically testing the identification of target with multiple visually similar objects that can only be distinguished through relational reasoning. Where2Place [62] evaluates the models ability to localize semantically appropriate and physically feasible free space for object placement based on the spatial relationships described in instructions. The pointing subset of VABench [63] (VABench-Point) evaluates models precision in grounding natural language commands to specific coordinate locations for robotic manipulation, requiring predicted points to fall within human-annotated regions of target objects or free space. Part-Afford [39] examines fine-grained object part-level affordance recognition across diverse object categories. RoboAfford-Eval [48] provides comprehensive benchmark covering both object and spatial affordance types in robotic manipulation contexts. As shown in Table 2, MiMo-Embodied achieves SOTA performance across all affordance prediction benchmarks.

EgoPlan2 [42] assesses long-horizon planning from video, requiring model to generate the correct action based on current observed image to reach goal. RoboVQA [45] specifically tests causal reasoning and future state prediction, where model must answer questions about the outcome of robotic actions, thereby probing its understanding of action consequences. Cosmos-Reason1 [3] presents multifaceted challenge in compositional reasoning and planning, evaluating the ability to generate complex, multi-step action plans for robotic manipulation tasks requiring both logical and physical understanding.

This proficiency in analyzing multi-step action sequences underscores MiMo-Embodieds effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning, establishing it as capable foundation for autonomous agents operating in complex, dynamic environments. Spatial Understanding Capability Spatial understanding capability measures the models proficiency in parsing spatial relationships, direction, distance, size, count, configuration, and etc, which is essential for navigation, object localization, and scene comprehension. We evaluate this capacity across nine benchmarks organized into three categories: spatial relationship reasoning (EmbSpatial [15], RoboSpatial [47], SAT [44], VSI-Bench [61], CRPE-relation [54]), spatial language grounding (RefSpatial-Bench [69], ERQA [50], the VQA subset of MetaVQA [56]), and comprehensive spatial intelligence (CV-Bench [51]).

Specifically, we evaluate the models performance on 12 benchmarks across 4 data types in terms of its ability to understand complex traffic scenes, predict the behaviors of dynamic road agents, and generate safe and efficient driving suggestions. As shown in Table 4 and Table 5, MiMo-Embodied delivers exceptional performance, outperforming general large multimodal models and specialized autonomous driving models. Perception Capability Perception capability aims to evaluate the models ability to understand its surrounding environment and serves as the foundation for downstream planning tasks. This capability requires the model to accurately extract both semantic and geometric information from sensor inputs, thereby constructing comprehensive and structured representation of the driving scene. Different application scenarios impose varying requirements on the granularity of perception: panoramic perception emphasizes holistic scene understanding, including integrated analysis of foreground traffic participants, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists (e.g., language-guided scene understanding as evaluated in LingoQA [38]), as well as high-level modeling of road topology, lane layouts, and traffic semantics (e.g., map-level understanding assessed by MAPLM [7]). In contrast, local perception focuses on fine-grained identification and reasoning about specific regions or objects, such as detailed analysis of rare or high-risk scenarios in CODA-LM [9], accurate grounding and recognition of objects referred to by natural language descriptions in MME-RealWorld [68], and precise coordinate-level localization of critical objects within complex dynamic scenes as required by DRAMA [37].

These results provide compelling evidence that MiMo-Embodied possesses multi-level, high-fidelity environmental perception capabilities, enabling it to effectively adapt to diverse real-world perception demands across varying granularities. Prediction Capability Prediction capability assesses the models capacity to reason about the future evolution of dynamic driving scenes and is fundamental to enabling safe, efficient, and proactive autonomous driving. It requires the model to go beyond momentary perception by integrating current and historical observations to accurately infer the latent intentions. This future-oriented understanding directly informs critical downstream functions such as trajectory planning, collision avoidance, and interactive driving behaviors. The prediction task encompasses multiple facets. At the individual level, it involves forecasting behavioral intent. Examples include whether vehicle will change lanes or pedestrian intends to cross, and this is typically evaluated in benchmarks such as MME-RealWorld [68]. At the interaction level, it requires modeling dynamic relationships among agents, including behaviors like yielding, cooperative maneuvers, and implicit social conventions in multi-agent scenarios. These interaction-centric capabilities are explicitly assessed in tasks like DriveLM [46] under the framework of object interaction between traffic elements. Experimental results show that the model achieves strong performance on both the single image benchmark MME-RealWorld and the multi-view images benchmark DriveLM, accurately capturing individual behavioral intentions and effectively modeling complex interactions among multiple agents.

Effective planning requires not only selecting appropriate low-level control commands including acceleration, braking, or turning but also reasoning about high-level driving strategies in alignment with traffic rules, social conventions, and dynamic scene context. The first action decision focuses on generating precise, goal-directed driving maneuvers in reaction to the evolving traffic environment. Benchmarks such as DriveLM [46], MME-RealWorld [68] and IDKB [33] evaluate this aspect by assessing the models ability to select appropriate driving actions in response to the current scene state. The second capability is driving reasoning, which provides explicit, interpretable justifications for those actions by grounding decisions in scene semantics and driving logic. This is assessed in benchmarks including LingoQA [38], CODA-LM [9], OmniDrive [53], NuInstruct [14] and BDD-X [31], which require the model not only to choose the correct action but also to explain why it is appropriate, for instance, yielding to an oncoming vehicle that is expected to proceed first, or stopping due to red traffic light ahead. The empirical results, summarized in Table 4 and Table 5, clearly demonstrate that MiMo-Embodied achieves outstanding performance across all planning-oriented benchmarks. This consistent superiority underscores the models strong capacity to not only generate accurate, context-appropriate driving decisions but also produce coherent and interpretable reasoning that aligns with real-world traffic logic and driving norms."

Our analysis first examines MiMo-Embodieds capacity for planning and reasoning from long-horizon instructions to generate precise target positions for execution, and then compares these predictions against baseline models to highlight MiMo-Embodieds superior performance in spatial reasoning and affordance understanding. Embodied Navigation We evaluate MiMo-Embodieds capabilities in downstream embodied navigation tasks using the long-horizon navigation task proposed in avA3 [67]. Given high-level human instruction (e.g., want to sleep or Water the plants in the study room), the model first needs to infer the spatial region to be explored and the target object to be located. Then, the model marks points on top-down map, indicating the area the robot needs to navigate to. Subsequently, it identifies and marks the target object in first-person perspective image, guiding the robot to successfully navigate to the target. We designed four distinct scenarios to evaluate our MiMo-Embodieds spatial reasoning and object localization capabilities. As shown in Figure 5, the visualization results demonstrate that MiMo-Embodied performs well in four household navigation tasks: locating the bed in the bedroom, finding the vacuum cleaner in the dining room, identifying plants in the study room, and locating the toilet in the bathroom. Each task requires the model to decompose the high-level instruction into spatial navigation (region identification on the map) and object localization (precise localization from an egocentric perspective), thus showcasing the models spatial understanding capabilities. To intuitively demonstrates the performance, we present comparative visualization of aforementioned navigation tasks across four multimodal models: GPT-4o [25], Qwen2.5-VL [5], RoboBrain-2.0 [49], and our proposed MiMo-Embodied. The visual comparisons in Figure 6 highlight MiMo-Embodieds enhanced 17 Figure 6 Visualization of different models for target object localization in embodied navigation tasks. The target positions are indicated by cyan points. object localization abilities and consistent performance under diverse household scenes. In single object localization tasks, both GPT-4o [25] and RoboBrain2.0 [49] tend to produce multiple scattered or clustered points that may deviates from the object center, indicating limitations in spatial precision. Our MiMoEmbodied model consistently achieves precise center localization, placing points directly at the core of target objects with remarkable accuracy. For plants localization, where the instruction implicitly requires recognizing multiple instances, MiMo-Embodied demonstrates the ability to comprehend the plural nature of the query, successfully identifying and accurately positioning both plant pots in the scene. In contrast, other models show some deficiencies in handling such compositional reasoning, either missing one instance or providing ambiguous localizations. These results highlight MiMo-Embodieds superior understanding of spatial relationships and linguistic nuances, particularly in complex scenarios requiring both precise object localization and comprehension of implicit semantic cues. The demonstrated capabilities provide solid foundation for downstream embodied navigation tasks where accurate target identification and spatial reasoning are crucial for successful task completion. Embodied Manipulation We evaluate MiMo-Embodieds manipulation capability through series of hierarchical pick-and-place tasks involving planning, affordance prediction, and spatial reasoning, as shown in Figure 7. The model is required to interpret high-level instructions and decompose them into sequence of precise 18 Figure 7 Results of deploying MiMo-Embodied to downstream embodied manipulation tasks. The target positions are indicated by cyan points. actions, including spatial reasoning for target localization and object affordance understanding for successful grasping and placement. The first task corresponds to the first two rows in Figure 7 assess the models ability in affordance prediction, such as distinguishing the lid of the pot and the handle of pink spoon for grasping and spatial locations for placement. The second task demonstrates the models advanced counting and spatial reasoning. Given the instruction Grasp the third orange from the left in the first row, place it between the oranges in the bottom row, the model must identify the correct orange using ordinal counting and then determine the target placement by interpreting the spatial relationship between. Another task involves placing the left bread in the specified plate, requiring estimation of height to identify the correct placement location given multiple plates. These results collectively highlight MiMo-Embodieds ability to integrate object affordance with sophisticated spatial and relational reasoning for embodied manipulation. We visualize the affordance predictions of GPT-4o [25], Qwen2.5-VL [5], RoboBrain-2.0 [49], and our proposed MiMo-Embodied in Figure 8. The evaluation focuses on three functionally-grounded tasks: identifying the graspable handle of pink spoon, locating an intermediate placement position between the oranges in the bottom row, and selecting the leftmost bread for pickup. These tasks assess the models capacity to interpret affordances and translate linguistic cues into spatially-grounded interaction points. The results reveal substantial differences in functional reasoning accuracy: both GPT-4o [25] and RoboBrain-2.0 [49] frequently generate points misaligned with functionally relevant regions, particularly struggling to identify graspable components and relational positions for object arrangement. While Qwen2.5-VL [5] demonstrates outstanding performance in object affordance, it shows limitations in handling spatial affordance in the second task. Notably, MiMo-Embodied consistently identifies functionally appropriate regions across all tasks. These findings underscore MiMo-Embodieds strong affordance and spatial reasoning capabilities, establishing reliable foundation for embodied manipulation tasks. 19 Figure 8 Visualization of different models for affordance prediction in embodied manipulation tasks.

            "title": "5.2.2 MiMo-Embodied for Autonomous Driving",
            "content": "To validate the efficacy of our training strategy, we evaluate our model on trajectory planning, core capability for autonomous driving systems. Our assessment is designed to be both fair and comprehensive, utilizing dual-pronged approach: we first establish performance on the challenging public NAVSIM benchmark [12] for standardized comparison, and then test the models capabilities on large-scale, proprietary dataset rich with diverse, real-world driving scenarios. Trajectory Planning on Public Benchmark NAVSIM [12] is public autonomous driving planning dataset widely used to evaluate the performance of planners. Given one single front-view image, the ego vehicles current state, and navigation command (e.g., go straight, turn left or turn right), the model is required to analyze the environment, perform reasoning, and finally generate 4-second future trajectory. To assess the trajectory planning capability of MiMo-Embodied, we provide quantitative comparisons in Table 6, where MiMo-Embodied is evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark [12] against InternVL3-8B [70] and its derivative ReCogDrive [32] planner of comparable scale. To ensure fair comparison with counterparts, we adopt the denoising policy from ReCogDrive [32] during the imitation IL stage, where noisy trajectories are 20 Figure 9 Qualitative results of trajectory planning by MiMo-Embodied on the NAVSIM benchmark. alternately fused with VLM hidden states, ego states, and historical trajectories. During the RL stage, we employ DiffGRPO [32] to further enhance the models performance. Here, NC, DAC, TTC, Conf, EP denote No At-Fault Collision, Drivable Area Compliance, Time-to-Collision, Comfort and Ego Process, respectively. The PDMS (Predictive Driver Model Score) metric is the weighted combination of above sub-scores, with detailed computation procedures available in [12]. All models take single front-view image as input and are trained for the same number of epochs. MiMo-Embodied consistently outperforms the competing models. Notably, unlike InternVL3 [70] that discretizes single-frame image into patches, MiMo-Embodied employs 3D convolutions to significantly reduce the number of LLM tokens while preserving detailed spatial context. Furthermore, we showcase set of representative driving scenarios. As illustrated in Figure 9, the qualitative results demonstrate that MiMo-Embodied can handle diverse autonomous driving situations and accomplish challenging tasks, including intersection turning, U-turning on curved roads, car-following and lane-change overtaking. In each case, the model is expected to perceive the road context, integrate the ego status and navigation intent, and produce coherent decision. Trajectory Planning on Proprietary Data To validate the efficacy of our training strategy in practical autonomous driving contexts, we evaluate the models trajectory planning performance on proprietary, large-scale dataset. This dataset, gathered from diverse geographic locations under wide spectrum of traffic conditions, features comprehensive set of driving scenarios. Beyond standard maneuvers such as straight-line driving and turns, it is enriched with challenging, safety-critical situations that involving detouring around vulnerable road users (VRUs), overtaking or bypassing slow and parked vehicles, and other complex interactions. The demonstration trajectories are sourced from expert human drivers, selected for their exemplary safety records and ability to perform smooth, comfortable maneuvers. These drivers exhibit strict adherence to traffic regulations and proficient defensive driving skills, ensuring the dataset provides high-quality, near-optimal driving exemplars for imitation learning. The entire evaluation set is meticulously annotated with precise trajectories and scenario labels. 21 Figure 10 Relative performance improvement of MiMo-Embodied 7B over baseline method Qwen2.5-VL 7B [5] of trajectory planning on the proprietary dataset. Improvement is quantified as the percentage reduction in error metric, with higher bars indicating greater error reduction and better performance. In our experimental setup, we predict ego vehicles 3-second trajectory based on five consecutive front-view camera frames sampled at 2 Hz, with predictions represented in the ego-vehicles coordinate. To ensure fair and rigorous comparison, our proposed MiMo-Embodied and the Qwen2.5-VL [5] baseline are evaluated under identical settings, including the input representation, full fine-tuning training strategy and the optimization procedure. We assess performance in an open-loop evaluation protocol, using the L2 distance [23] over the 3-second prediction horizon as the primary metric. As illustrated in Figure 10, which depicts the relative performance over the baseline, MiMo-Embodied consistently outperforms the baseline across all evaluated categories. Notably, the performance gains are most pronounced in complex, interactive maneuvers such as turns, nudges around obstacles, and lane changes. These scenarios are inherently challenging as they require anticipating the behavior of other road users and precise vehicle control. This substantial improvement, particularly in high-complexity scenarios, provides strong evidence that our embodied training paradigm equips the model with superior capacity for reasoning in complex driving situations. It also translates to better generalization across unseen road conditions with universal driving logic. Consequently, the model generates trajectories that are more accurate and more aligned with expert human driving behavior."

            "title": "5.3 Ablation Study",
            "content": "To verify the effectiveness of our proposed multi-stage training strategy, we conducted systematic ablation experiments, with the results presented in Table 7. The experimental results show that the model trained using only embodied data (MiMo-VL w/ Embodied) achieves strong performance in both domains, whereas the model trained solely on autonomous driving data (MiMo-VL w/ AD) excels in its own domain but suffers from significant performance drop on embodied tasks. This indicates that simple single-task training is insufficient for cross-domain generalization. Under the experimental condition of ensuring approximately the same number of loss tokens, directly training embodied and autonomous driving tasks together (MiMoVL w/ Embodied+AD) achieves improvements on embodied tasks, but the performance of autonomous driving declines slightly. In contrast, our proposed MiMo-Embodied employs multi-stage training strategy, effectively mitigating cross-domain task interference through progressive course learning. It achieves an 22 Model Embodied AD Multi-Stage Affordance Spatial Plan Embodied Avg.

The report provides comprehensive overview of the design, data construction, training methodologies, and practical applications of MiMo-Embodied, aiming to inspire future research in the field. Building on the capabilities of our MiMo-Embodied model, we will explore Embodied AI Vision-Language Action (VLA) Models to enhance interaction in complex environments, enabling more intuitive task execution through natural language understanding. Additionally, we aim to develop Autonomous Driving VLA Models that allow these systems to interpret real-time traffic conditions and respond effectively to dynamic driving scenarios. Furthermore, we will investigate the integration of multi-modal learning, such as utilizing 3D point clouds, to improve long-term planning and decision-making capabilities, as well as advance human-robot interaction. These areas are crucial for enhancing overall performance and driving innovation in both embodied AI and autonomous driving technologies."

            "content": "A.1 General Visual Understanding To verify that MiMo-Embodieds specialized training does not come at the cost of general proficiency, we evaluate it across range of general visual understanding benchmarks including MMMU-Pro (Standard and Vision) [64], Mantis [28], AI2D [30], V* [58], VLMs are Blind [43], PixmoCount [13], and CountBench [40]. The evaluation metrics for all benchmarks are based on accuracy. We compare MiMo-Embodied with its base model, MiMo-VL [59], as well as top-tier proprietary and open-source models including Qwen2.5-VL [5], InternVL3 [70], GPT-4o [25], and Claude 3.7 Sonnet [1]).

Results for Qwen2.5-VL [5], InternVL3 [70], GPT-4o [25], and Claude 3.7 Sonnet [1] are sourced from the MiMo-VL [59] technical report for consistent comparison. The best results among the listed models are bolded and the second-best is underlined. The comprehensive results in Table 8 reveal that after multi-stage embodied and autonomous driving finetuning, MiMo-Embodieds general capabilities remain intact. MiMo-Embodied preserves the proficiency of its base model MiMo-VL [59] while achieving notable improvements across some benchmarks. On complex reasoning tasks, MiMo-Embodied achieves 9.71 and 9.88 points absolute gain on MMMU-Prostandard and MMMU-Provision benchmarks [64], respectively. For visual question answering, MiMo-Embodied delivers competitive results with 81.10% on Mantis [28] and 84.20% on AI2D [30]. It also achieves the best performance on V* [58] benchmark. On general counting benchmarks, MiMo-Embodied excels MiMo-VL [59] with an improvement of 4.15 points on PixmoCount [13] and 2.03 points on CountBench [40]. The improvements on general visual understanding benchmarks indicate that the specialized training for MiMo-Embodied in embodied AI and autonomous driving yields benefits not only for target domains but also for fundamental visual comprehension. For instance, the gains in complex reasoning and counting likely stem from enhanced fine-grained object recognition and structural understanding, while spatial benchmarks benefit from improved dynamic relationship modeling and 3D spatial reasoning. This confirms that MiMo-Embodieds specialized training not only preserves but amplifies its general vision-language proficiency. 29 A.2 Embodied Visualization Examples A.2.1 Spatial Understanding Figure 11 Embodied spatial understanding example 1. 30 Figure 12 Embodied spatial understanding example 2. 31 Figure 13 Embodied spatial understanding example 3. 32 Figure 14 Embodied spatial understanding example 4. 33 Figure 15 Embodied spatial understanding example 5. 34 Figure 16 Embodied spatial understanding example 6.
