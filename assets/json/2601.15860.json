            "content": "tables [3], limiting the effectiveness of dense retrieval methods. In practice, serialized tables frequently exceed encoder token limits, making querytable semantic matching more challenging. To address the semantic gap and long table scenarios, recent studies have attempted to address these issues through semantic augmentation. QGpT [7] adopts two-stage design: First, it selects the first 𝑘 rows of the table to form partial table, which serves as an approximation of the entire table under the token length restriction. Then, it uses an LLM to generate synthetic queries for the partial table, extending the structured content into natural language for easier semantic matching with queries. However, QGpT has two main limitations: (1) Heuristic instance selection: it uses simple top-𝑘 strategy that lacks representativeness for the entire table; (2) Coarse representation fusion: it concatenates the partial table and synthetic queries into single sequence, making it difficult to control their relative contributions to the final table representation. To address these issues, we propose STAR (Semantic TAble Representation), lightweight framework for table retrieval that improves table representations without modifying the underlying retriever architecture. STAR captures table semantics by selecting representative instances and augmenting tables with synthetic queries, which are then integrated through fusion mechanism. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Concretely, our contributions are: We introduce STAR, lightweight framework for table retrieval that improves semantic table representations without modifying the retriever architecture. We propose clustering-based approach to select representative table content, improving semantic coverage beyond heuristic row sampling. We present fusion strategy that integrates tables with synthetic queries for improved querytable alignment. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR consistently outperforms baseline methods.

STAR improves representation via two stages: (1) replacing top-𝑘 sampling with Header-aware Clustering for diverse instance selection and query generation, and (2) replacing simple concatenation with Weighted Fusion to explicitly model the importance of structured data and synthetic queries. Different colors denote different semantic row clusters."

            "content": "STAR significantly outperforms QGpT. The STAR framework outperforms QGpT under all fusion strategies. For example, with DWF, STARs average R@1 improves by 6.39 percentage points, and R@5 also increases by 6.06 percentage points. This shows that the semantic clustering and weighted fusion strategies proposed in STAR are effective at capturing the semantics of tables and improving retrieval performance. Different weights in FWF reflect dataset characteristics. Analyzing the performance of different weights (𝜆) in FWF, we observe that different datasets have varying preferences for query weight. The Mimo (ch) and Mimo (en) datasets perform best when 𝜆 is between 0.4 and 0.5. This is likely because the Mimo tables originate from real-world Excel files, which have higher structural complexity. In this case, synthetic queries serve as more effective semantic bridge between user queries and complex tables. In contrast, the OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ datasets achieve the best FWF performance at lower values of 𝜆 (e.g., 0.3 or 0.4). These datasets contain simpler table structures, where the tables inherent semantics are already clear. Thus, giving higher weight to the table itself leads to better retrieval performance. DWF demonstrates strong adaptability and potential. DWF demonstrates strong adaptability and runs robustly across different datasets. DWF performs best on OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2EWTQ, while also achieving competitive results on the both Mimo datasets. This indicates that DWF can effectively balance the semantic sources of different tables through dynamic weighting without requiring manual tuning. In the future, this could be replaced with more powerful learnable module for end-to-end adaptive weighting. Table 1: Performance comparison on five datasets with different fusion strategies.

Based on these variants, the experimental results reveal the following observations: Importance of the SCQG stage. Among all components, SCQG contributes the most to overall performance. Removing SCQG leads to substantial drop in average R@1 from 51.86% to 47.07% (4.79), indicating that semantic clustering plays critical role in selecting representative instances and enabling diverse, cluster-aware query generation. Effect of Weighted Fusion. Compared to SCQG, weighted fusion provides complementary but smaller gain. When replacing weighted fusion with simple concatenation (w/o WF), the average R@1 decreases by 2.78 points, suggesting that explicitly modeling the relative importance of structured tables and synthetic queries is beneficial for fine-grained semantic alignment. Role of Header-aware Clustering. Incorporating header semantics yields consistent improvement.Removing header information from clustering results in 1.29-point drop in R@1, indicating that header-aware embeddings help stabilize clustering quality by providing global schema context, even when instance semantics dominate.
