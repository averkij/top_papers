            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Ocular and systemic diseases affecting the eye represent an important health concern. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become the standard imaging technique to assess and diagnose several retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) [12]. With the emergence of OCT and other advanced 2 R. Fecso et al. imaging modalities, medical artificial intelligence (AI) offers great potential to accelerate the diagnostic process [31]. However, traditional AI methods, mostly based on deep learning (DL), rely on large amounts of labeled data, which requires costly manual annotation. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained popularity because it allows models to learn meaningful features from unlabeled data [7]. The combination of SSL techniques and large datasets and DL architectures has enabled the development of foundation models (FMs) [2], generalizable models that can be efficiently adapted to several applications. common SSL approach is masked modeling (MM), which randomly masks part of the input and tasks the model with reconstructing the missing data, thus learning meaningful data representations. The most common MM method for images is Masked Autoencoding (MAE) [10], based on Vision Transformer (ViT) [6]. RETFound [31] applied MAE to develop separate FMs for retinal OCT and fundus images, demonstrating strong performance on diagnostic tasks. UrFound [29] trained an FM using joint MAE and masked language modeling (MLM). Uni4Eye++ [3] trained model on multimodal data using multi-step MAE approach. Despite the promising results, some studies [8,1] have shown that MAE-based methods produce suboptimal representations for perceptual, highly semantic tasks. In contrast, VisionFM [20] used self-distillation approach to develop separate FMs for 8 ophthalmic modalities, resulting in improved performance over RETFound. Self-distillation learning consists of feeding two different image views to two encoders, and mapping one to the other using predictor. Regardless of the approach, existing FMs for OCT are still limited by the relatively small size of the pretraining dataset compared to FMs for computer vision [18,31,20], which leads to data bias, lower generalizability and, in some cases, the need for supervised tuning to specific populations or applications. Another popular SSL approach is contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) [21], which consists of training vision-language model (VLM) by aligning visual and textual representations from different encoders using an imagetext contrastive (ITC) loss. CLIP has gained popularity in the medical field due to the common availability of paired image and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data [24,30]. FLAIR [24] performed CLIP on 37 classification datasets of color fundus images by converting class labels into descriptions. However, this approach is not readily adaptable to unstructured data (e.g., EHRs) as it requires non-trivial decisions about how to create class labels and their descriptions. Moreover, CLIP alone is suboptimal for medical data because there exists high semantic overlap (e.g., patients with the same diseases or biomarkers) [23]. This causes unpaired examples to be pushed apart in the embedding space regardless of their semantic similarity, resulting in false negatives [15]. Also, CLIP-based approaches usually struggle to distinguish subtle pathological patterns in medical images, as they rely only on global features [11]. To mitigate these issues, other works [14,28,4] have proposed to combine CLIP-like ITC losses with MM and imagetext matching (ITM) objectives. ALBEF [14] trains 3-encoder network (image, text, and multimodal) using ITC,"

Cross-attention layers are activated only during the forward passes for ITM, MLM, and GM. An example of an OCT image and report is shown. ITM and MLM losses and momentum model. In the medical domain, PTUnifier [4] used similar setting but with single model by unifying text and image inputs via prompts. CoCa [28] achieved SOTA zero-shot classification performance of natural images by jointly training VLM on contrastive and captioning tasks. Despite strong downstream performance, the use of these advanced approaches to develop or improve retinal FMs has not yet been explored. Contribution. In this work, we present RetFiner  (Fig. 1)  , an efficient visionlanguage refinement scheme for retinal foundation models. Our approach consists of training VLM composed of vision encoder based on an arbitrary retinal FM and separate language model using set of diverse training objectives focused on exploiting the EHRs as supervisory signals for improving visual representations. To validate our approach, we refined the retinal FMs RETFound [31], UrFound [29], and VisionFM [20] with our scheme using an in-house dataset of 100k pairs of OCTs and associated EHRs. Running RetFiner on this dataset for an FM requires less than 10 epochs. Linear probing of the refined vision FMs on six public and one in-house OCT classification datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach for both improving the semantic understanding of the models and adapting them to targeted populations. Our RetFiner models set new benchmark for OCT image analysis, with potential applications where high-level semantics are required, such as visual question aswering. To facilitate research progress, we have published the code and model weights."

            "content": "RetFiner, as seen in Fig. 1, employs simple architecture comprised of ViT [6] vision encoder and Transformer text encoder [26]. This architecture allows single-modality and cross-modality embedding. Cross-attention (CA) layers are added between the self-attention and feed-forward layers of the text encoder. CA layers are utilized for cross-modality encoding and generation, but deactivated for uni-modal encoding. The text encoder therefore acts as uni-modal or crossmodal encoder as well as decoder. 4 R. Fecso et al. The model is trained to optimize four losses, as shown in Fig. 1: imagetext contrastive (ITC), image-text matching (ITM), masked language modeling (MLM), and generative modeling (GM) (captioning). Such combination effectively enhances the models cross-modality alignment, understanding, and generation capabilities, ultimately improving visual representations. The total loss is direct sum of all the losses equally weighted: = LITC + LITM + LMLM + LGM. (1) To efficiently use the model for downstream classification tasks, we propose simple feature pooling strategy that integrates both global and local features. In particular, we concatenate the CLS token and the average pool of the patch tokens. Then, these features are fed into trainable linear layer."

            "content": "ITC. We employ an ITC loss to align the vision and text encoders in the embedding space in order to learn better multi-modal representations. We use the InfoNCE loss from [17] to bring pairs of images and texts together in the embedding space while pushing apart negative pairs. ITM. We use an ITM loss along with ITC to further align the image and text encoders. To challenge the model during training, we use hard negative mining, inspired by [14]. In this scheme, for given image, the model must predict whether another report from the same batch is part of the same pair. The candidate report is sampled from other reports in the batch, where reports with higher cosine similarity in the embedding space to the given image have higher chance of being sampled. This loss is also calculated with images and reports swapping places. Such loss forces the model to learn to differentiate highly similar samples and in turn learn more discriminative features. MLM. Despite the success of instance-level tasks such as ITC and ITM, they may be limited by the semantic overlap in medical images [30]. To address this, we include two reconstruction tasks: MLM [5] and GM. These non-contrastive tasks act as regularizers for ITC and ITM, while improving the models semantic understanding and generation. MLM aims to predict randomly masked input tokens from reports in bidirectional manner using Cross-Entropy (CE) loss. GM. To supplement the MLM task and enhance the models reconstruction and generation abilities, we add generative text modeling task. Given the context of an OCT and previous report tokens, the model is trained to autoregressively predict the next masked report token using CE as loss function."

The vision encoder is based on the ViT architecture [6] and text encoder is pre-trained BERT [5]. During the forward pass for the ITC loss, cross-attention was turned off in the text encoder. The CLS tokens from each encoder were projected down to dimension of 512 with linear layer, then L2-normalized before being passed into the ITC loss. For the remaining losses, cross-attention was activated between the self-attention and feed forward layers of each block. The patch tokens from the vision encoder were passed into the text encoder as the hidden states to perform cross-attention. For the MLM loss, 15% of the report tokens are randomly masked. For the GM loss, 60% of the report tokens are masked with causal attention masks."

The performance of the refined models was then compared with that of the out-of-the-box models and two SOTA general-purpose vision models: CLIP [21] and DINOv2 [18]. The performance was evaluated via linear probing with our concatenation pooling strategy on seven retinal disease classification datasets, namely OCTDL [13], OCTID [9], GAMMA [27], Harvard Glaucoma [16], NEHUT [25], Noor Eye Hospital [22], and an in-house dataset [anon. ref.]. These datasets cover range of demographics, devices, and diseases, including AMD, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Each experiment was run five times with different seeds. Models were evaluated using balanced accuracy (BAcc), area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), average prevision (AP), and, for ablation, also F1. State-of-the-art Comparison. Table 1 shows the average performance of our method and the SOTA retinal and general-purpose FMs across the different tasks. Per-dataset performances are shown in Table 2. As shown in the tables, the top three performances across all metrics come from models refined using our proposed approach, with RetFiner-R and RetFiner-U performing the best in terms of BAcc and AUROC and AP, respectively. Improvement Analysis. Tables 1 and 2 show significant improvement in downstream classification performance for RetFiner models compared to their off-theshelf counterparts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for improving existing FMs. This is more remarkable considering our method requires less than ten epochs to refine model. Also importantly, our method significantly improves all retinal FMs on our complex in-house dataset (with 9 classes), which represents pathologies of high clinical relevance in general and in our clinic in particular. This demonstrates our methodss ability to mitigate the data bias found in retinal FMs while also leveraging their powerful representations, allowing us to create model suitable for our applications using in-house data, with no need for manual annotation or data processing. Baseline Comparison and Ablation Study. We compared our method to existing VLM approaches and tested the effect of the different losses on downstream performance to demonstrate their positive effect. In both cases, we used our MAE-pretrained model as the base model and passed it through our scheme 8 R. Fecso et al. Table 4.

CLIP and UrFound baselines are analogous to training using only ITC and MLM losses, respectively. The resulting models were evaluated by linear probing on our in-house dataset. As shown in Table 3, all losses result in significantly higher downstream performance. We also tested the effect of our token pooling strategy for linear probing. During refinement, the ITC loss uses only the CLS token, while the other losses use only the patch tokens. We asserted that using both led to better exploitation of the models features. We compared this strategy with other common pooling strategies: CLS token, average pooling of patch tokens, and average pooling of all tokens (patch+CLS). Table 4 shows that the concatenation technique results in statistically significant increase in balanced accuracy, AP, and F1-score. Explainability. Fig. 2 shows examples of the attention rollout maps for our refined models RetFiner-R and RetFiner-U, based on RETFound and UrFound, respectively. The attention maps are generated by calculating the cross-attentions in the text encoder between the image features and the text features. As shown in the images, RetFiners maps highlight the retinal layers and activate more strongly around the lesion biomarkers indicated in the text, regardless of the base FM. This demonstrates the effective semantic understanding of OCT images by our RetFiner models and their explanatory capabilities."
