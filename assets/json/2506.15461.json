Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to perform on variety of language tasks. State of the art LLM training utilizes multiple Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) to parallelize and shard the training. The model is split across several GPUs (constituting stages), which communicate with the node servicing the previous layers and node servicing the next layers to execute the model in pipeline parallel (PP) fashion 1. Typically, pipelining is combined with data parallelism (DP) where several of these pipelines are trained in parallel on different data, synchronizing their gradients at the end of an iteration. Training such large models can take several months even on specialized high performance clusters Dubey et al. (2024); Yuan et al. (2022). Recent works have proposed training models on cheaper GPUs, such as decentralized or cloud spot instances (preemptible GPUs) Jang et al. (2023); Thorpe et al. (2023); Ryabinin et al. (2023). Due to the high training time, (hardware) failures during the training are inevitable Zhang et al. (2022). Moreover, the number of failures is expected to be higher for training on such wimpy spot instances since the failures can also occur due to spot nodes becoming 1Together all nodes of distributed model is termed pipeline.

Here, we exclude Oobleck Jang et al. (2023) since it does not recover full stage failure. Additional Memory Additional Comm. Additional Comp.

In pipeline, stage can have partial nodes or all nodes failure. We omit the former scenario, since failing node can be trivially recovered by using the alive nodes of the same stage as the checkpoints. For example, when new nodes join, the most recent weights can be downloaded from peer in the same stage, as per Jang et al. (2023). In this work, we aim to design recovery methods for stage failures. This could happen when either (i) there is no DP and each stage is only run by single node or (ii) all the nodes of the same stage fails simultaneously. The latter case is plausible for real deployment via spot instances since such nodes of the same stage would be rented from the same geographic location (to minimize the DP communication overhead) Yuan et al. (2022), and in the case of high demand on that location, all spot instances becomes unavailable simultaneously Thorpe et al. (2023). To deal with stage failures during training, conventional approaches make use of checkpointing - periodically saving the model state to non-volatile storage, which should remain reachable throughout the training Wang et al. (2023). When failure occurs, the state of the model is reverted to the previously stored one, thus losing several GPU hours of training time. careful tradeoff is chosen between checkpointing frequency and training throughput, as checkpointing too frequently to remote storage can slow down the training time Wang et al. (2023). For example, LLaMa 70B requires roughly 520GBs when serialized and even on high bandwidth networks2, would require upwards of 20 minutes per checkpoint, thus impacting training at high checkpointing frequency. Alternatively to checkpointing, Bamboo Thorpe et al. (2023) uses redundant computation across the pipeline to recover failures where each node stores and does redundant computation for the following stage (in addition to their assigned stage). Both recovery methods require significant overhead either in storage, communication or computation. In this work, we propose an efficient recovery method CheckFree. Our novel approach can recover, even when an entire stage has failed, without the need for checkpointing and without redundant computations, thus significantly outperforming the state of the art. To achieve this, we exploit layer stacking Agarwal et al. (2024) and LLMs; natural resilience to layer omission Elhoushi et al. (2024). When stage has crashed, we reinitialize it with weighted average of its two neighbouring stages, on new node. However, this strategy fails to recover the first and last stages without suffering from significant convergence drop. For those case, we utilize the idea of out of order pipeline parallelism Blagoev et al. (2025), such that the second and second to last stage learn the behaviour of the first and last stage respectively. We refer to the extension that also recovers the first and last stages as CheckFree+. visualization of the different approaches is presented in Fig. 1, and the comparison of their costs is given in Table 1. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We first present relevant background knowledge on 2Assuming high-bandwidth CPU-to-GPU bus and 500Mb/s connection.

Figure 1 Three recovery strategies from stage failure. a) In typical checkpointing strategies, an external non-faulty storage is used, which periodically stores checkpoints. Upon failure, new node receives stale weights from the storage and continues training. b)In decentralized training, redundant computation can be used to recover from failure of an entire stage Thorpe et al. (2023). Each stage performs also the computations of the subsequent stage. When new node joins, it can download the stage 1 weights from the previous stage. c) Our solutions CheckFree and CheckFree+ do not require checkpointing or redundant computation. Instead, we use the weights of the two neighbouring stages to initialize the failed stage. CheckFree+ also recovers the first and last stages by copying the corresponding neighbouring stage which is trained to simulate the same behaviour. fault tolerance and checkpointing. We then present our main method, with theoretical justification of its stability. We further extend our work with novel use of out of order pipelining for redundant knowledge encoding. Lastly, we extensively evaluate our solution across various models and settings with failures and demonstrate superior performance of our method, which improves training time by over 12% in low stage failure frequencies relative to redundant computation. 2. Related Work Failure Recovery. As the models are growing and training process becoming ever more expensive, fault-tolerant distributed LLM training has been receiving greater recognition Ryabinin et al. (2023); Thorpe et al. (2023); Jang et al. (2023); Liang et al. (2025). Works such as SWARM Ryabinin et al. (2023) and DMoE Ryabinin and Gusev (2020) studied efficient recovery in pipeline-parallel training in the presence of failures. Recovery of weights and optimizer states has typically been performed through checkpointing Wang et al. (2023), where periodically the values of the weights and optimizer state are stored in some non-faulty remote storage. On node failure, nodes return to the previous checkpoint they have stored (locally) and new coming nodes download the weights from the remote storage. The training proceeds from the previous checkpoint and the models convergence is unaffected. In decentralized training via spot instances, churn rates are even higher and there may not be an available non-faulty storage to save the checkpoints to. Thus, checkpointing strategies are inefficient if not impossible for this setting. Recent works have attempted to address these shortcomings. Bamboo Thorpe et al. (2023) makes use of redundant computation, where each node computes the forward pass for itself and redundantly for the next node in the pipeline. In the case of failure of node (or stage), the previous node(s) can immediately continue the training with the redundant weights. However, such mechanism can prove too costly for large models, as each node must now perform double the training Jang et al. (2023). To address this, Oobleck Jang et al. (2023) makes use of the data parallel replication to recover from failures, where new nodes can get the weights from any of the nodes servicing the same weights as it. While efficient, such recovery mechanism fails when an entire stage is gone. Layer Stacking. Layer (or model) stacking has emerged in recent years as an efficient method for training LLMs by starting from small model and periodically initializing new weights Agarwal et al. (2024); Du et al. (2024); Saunshi et al. (2024). Across commonly used strategies such as copying layer to increase the depth and random initialization, it is shown that copying the last layer provides the All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints biggest speed up and has the best over all performance, even outperforming training the full model Du et al. (2024). In Agarwal et al. (2024), authors further demonstrated that such method of initialization approximates accelerated Nesterov gradient descent. Finally, in Saunshi et al. (2024), authors showed the resemblance of models trained with stacking to looped LLMs Lan et al. (2020) and further found that stacking new layers in the middle greatly improves the models reasoning for downstream tasks. Layer Omission. As the yang to layer stacking, layer skipping is about removal (pruning) of layers during training or afterwards. LayerSkip demonstrated that during training layers can be skipped to improve early exit inference and to speed up training Elhoushi et al. (2024). SkipPipe further demonstrated arbitrary layer skipping and out of order execution as viable method to speed up distributed training Blagoev et al. (2025). Both of these are reminiscent of earlier work on Stochastic Depth, which has been shown to work as gradient noise regularization Veit et al. (2016). The work Ma et al. (2022); Zhou et al. (2023) demonstrated that models can converge even with layers removed/skipped during training. This implies certain redundancy between neighbouring layers of Large Language Models. 3. Problem Statement Notation. We assume model , composed of an embedding layer E, several layers with residual connections 𝑓1... 𝑓𝐿, and deembedding layer 1 : = 1 (𝐼 + 𝑓𝐿) ... (𝐼 + 𝑓2) (𝐼 + 𝑓1) E, where is composing operation which is distributive around summation and 𝐼 is the identity matrix. The weights of each layer 𝑖 are given by 𝑊𝑖. The goal of the model (F : Y) is to minimize some loss function (𝔼(𝑥,𝑦)𝐷L) over some dataset (𝐷 with distribution Y) via some optimization algorithm. Distributed Training. The model is split over stages 𝑆0...𝑆𝑠, each holding non overlapping and consecutive partition of the layers. The weights of stage 𝑖 are given by 𝑊𝑠,𝑖. Nodes serve single stage and communicate with their peers to train the model. Communication occurs over the network and is associated with delays dependent on the bandwidth and latency between pairs of nodes. No central non-faulty storage exists to which model weights can be offloaded. Failure pattern. Nodes can fail at arbitrary points. failing node is disconnected from the training and its local progress is lost. This can occur due to hardware errors or preemptible instances temporarily disconnecting. Upon failure of 𝑘 nodes 𝑘 new nodes can be made available within negligible amount of time (e.g. starting new on spot node in different location to join the training). We distinguish between failures where at least one node remains per stage and failures where some stage has no nodes in it. Dealing with the former type of failures is trivial as new nodes can download the parameters for given stage from node alive serving that stage Ryabinin et al. (2023); Jang et al. (2023). Such recovery has no impact on the convergence of the model (as all replicas have the same weights). We henceforth focus only on recovering from failures where stage is entirely disconnected. When stage fails, its weights are essentially replaced with all zeroes (𝑊𝑠,𝑖 = 0). We assume that no two consecutive stages can fail, which is an assumption also used in redundant computation Thorpe et al. (2023). We additionally assume that new nodes can be made available to replace (at least some of) the nodes that have crashed in the missing stage. This can be done by spawning new nodes in different region in on-spot instances or keeping some participants on standby in decentralized training. 4 All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints 4. Our Recovery Method 4.1. Motivation Our recovery method draws inspiration from several key (known and experimented) observations regarding training of LLMs in the presence of layer omissions and stacking. LLMs are resilient to layer omission. Recent works have demonstrated that in both training and inference time, LLMs are resilient to layer omission Blagoev et al. (2025); Elhoushi et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024). This is partially attributed to the residual connections Veit et al. (2016) and suggests degree of redundancy encoded in the layers (neighbouring layers can perform each others functionality). Layer stacking can improve LLMs performance. It has shown that initializing new layers through neighbouring one improves training efficiency as well as the models reasoning Saunshi et al. (2024); Du et al. (2024); Agarwal et al. (2024). Figure 2 Varying reinitialization strategies for failed stages. Based on these observations, we consider recovering failed stage by copying neighboring stage. However, in our initial experiments, we observe that simple copy of one stage is an insufficient initialization method, as such recovery greatly hampers models convergence. We present this in Fig. 2 where we train the same model and reinitialize models on failure using different strategies. We compare three different strategies - random (randomly initializing the new stage), copy (copying the previous stage), and weighted (or gradient) averaging. In the later sections, we extend the recovery method by reinitializing failed stages as weighted average of their two neighbours. Considering each stage as an independent few-shot learner, as in Reddi et al. (2023), averaging of stages can be seen similar to model merging Wortsman et al. (2022); Frankle et al. (2020) where several models are averaged together to achieve an improved ensemble model. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that though copying neighbouring stage is significantly better than random reinitialization (of the failed stage), gradient averaging significantly outperforms the other two methods for reinitializing. In the following sections, we explain how we choose these weights (for CheckFree) as well as how we can recover the first and last stages since they have only single neighbour (via CheckFree+). 4.2. CheckFree: Memoryless Recovery Algorithm 1 Recovery algorithm for stage 𝑖 Require: new node assigned to stage 𝑖, 𝜆 learning rate 1: Receive 𝑊𝑠,𝑖1 and 𝜔𝑖1 of stage 𝑖 1 where 𝜔𝑖1 = 𝑊𝑠,𝑖12 2: Receive 𝑊𝑠,𝑖+1 and 𝜔𝑖+1 of stage 𝑖 + 1 where 𝜔𝑖+1 = 𝑊𝑠,𝑖+12 3: Initialize the weights of the failed stage 𝑊𝑠,𝑖 4: Update learning rate 𝜆 1.1𝜆 5: Continue training from the current batch 𝜔𝑖1𝑊𝑠,𝑖1+𝜔𝑖1𝑊𝑠,𝑖+1 𝜔𝑖1+𝜔𝑖+1 In the case of no checkpointing or redundant computation, if stage failure happens, then by default, the models weights for the failed stages are lost. Our method does not directly recover the exact weights of the failed stage, but recovers (maintains) the models performance by replacing the failed stages with 5 All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints combination of the remaining ones. Specifically, by taking into account the observations given in the previous section, we replace the failed stage 𝑊𝑠,𝑖 = 0 with 𝑊𝑠,𝑖 = , i.e. the weighted average of the weights of its neighbouring stages. 𝜔𝑖1𝑊𝑠,𝑖1+𝜔𝑖+1𝑊𝑠,𝑖+1 𝜔𝑖1+𝜔𝑖+1 Now, we discuss how to select the weights 𝜔𝑖1 and 𝜔𝑖+1. known approach is to copy the previous stage when initializing new weights (𝜔𝑖+1 = 0). However, as we see in Figure 2, this proves inferior to aggregated averaging. naive way of averaging would be uniform average of the two stages, i.e. (𝜔𝑖1 = 𝜔𝑖+1). Such averaging, though, does not distinguish the importance and convergence of the stages, and thereby leads to slower convergence of the overall model. For that reason, we use the weights of the last gradient norm of the given stage, i.e. 𝜔𝑖1 = 𝑊𝑠,𝑖12 and 𝜔𝑖+1 = 𝑊𝑠,𝑖+12. Conceptually, this gives more weight to stages which have not converged as much yet, thus partially offloading their functionality to the new stage. To achieve weighted gradient averaging, for each stage 𝑆𝑖, the nodes need to store the gradient norm 𝑊𝑠,𝑖2 and send it to the new-coming nodes. The communication and storage overhead of this is negligible, as 𝑊𝑠,𝑖2 is single scalar, which is awfully smaller than the size of the weights of the stage ((𝑊𝑠,𝑖2) 𝑊𝑠,𝑖). Once the weights are reinitialized, to further assist the new-formed stages in diverging from their (possibly) inferior state, we scale up the learning rate (by 1.1). Our solution is presented in Algorithm 1. The method presented so far cannot recover the first and last stage, as there is no second neighbour to average from. Additionally, as identified in several other works, the first and last stage perform different functionality than the other stages (the first stage especially) and are critical to the performance of the model Saunshi et al. (2024); Bhojanapalli et al. (2021). simple copy of one neighbour results in significant drop in performance. naive approach is to assume that these stages either do not fail (hosted on on-demand instances) or have significantly smaller chances of failure (hosted on more trust-worthy devices). With such an assumption, CheckFree can recover during training. 4.3. CheckFree+: First and Last Stage Recovery Here we present CheckFree+ which extends CheckFree by also recovering the first and last stage failures. We take inspiration from out-of-order pipeline parallelism presented in Blagoev et al. (2025) to mimic redundant computation Thorpe et al. (2023) without actually duplicating computation. For half the microbatches we run the stages in standard order (𝑆0, 𝑆1, 𝑆2...𝑆𝐿1, 𝑆𝐿, 𝑆0)3 and for the other half we swap the order of the first two and last two stages excluding the (de)embedding layers (i.e. 𝑆0, 𝑆2, 𝑆1...𝑆𝐿, 𝑆𝐿1, 𝑆0). In this way, the neighboring stages of the first and last stages, 𝑆2 and 𝑆𝐿1, redundantly learn the behaviour of 𝑆1 and 𝑆𝐿 respectively, without any additional computation, as half the time they take their places in the pipeline. For the same reason, this would result in the two layers having very similar weights (within some noise range of each other), meaning they can easily be recovered from one another. Out-of-order training, however, comes with small degradation to convergence, as noted in Blagoev et al. (2025). As such, if the failure chance is almost negligible, this solution would prove slower than no checkpointing, due to the longer time needed to converge. CheckFree+ cannot recover the embedding and deembedding (LM head) layers. While some works explore sharing the weights between the two Hillier et al. (2024), thus suggesting that in case of failure of either or 1 the weights can be reinitialized by copying the other ones, in this work we simply send their weights to the previous and following stages. Thus in case of failure the weights can be recovered exactly without loss of data. While this may resemble some form of decentralized checkpointing, we note that the sizes of these layers are significantly smaller compared to the other stages, thus presenting minimal communication and storage overhead. 3Note, here 𝑆0 holds only embedding and deembedding layers. 6 All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints 4.4. Convergence Analysis of CheckFree We base our proof on Ma et al. (2022). The model is comprised of an embedding layer E, deembedding layer 1, and series of residual functions = 1 (𝐼 + 𝑓𝑙) ... (𝐼 + 𝑓1) E. Post failure of layer 𝑘, the model is modified as = (𝐼 + 𝑓𝑙) ... (𝐼 + 𝑓𝑘+1) (𝐼 + 𝜔1 𝑓𝑘+1 + 𝜔2 𝑓𝑘1) (𝐼 + 𝑓𝑘1)... (𝐼 + 𝑓1) E. Assumption 1. The loss function (F ) is L-smooth and convex: (F1) (F2) 𝐿 F1 F2 F1, F2. Assumption 2. For some 𝛿 [0, 1) at any timestep 𝑡 the model reduction error is bounded by: where 𝑚 is 0-1 vector selecting given layers of the model. F𝑡 𝑚 F𝑡 2 𝛿2F𝑡 2 This is common assumption in literature Zhou et al. (2023); Ma et al. (2022). Given these assumptions, the convergence of model past failure with our recovery method is given by: 𝑡 𝔼F 𝑡1 F02 ( 1 𝑡 ) + 𝑡 2𝔼𝜔1 𝑓𝑘+1 + 𝜔2 𝑓𝑘1 𝑓𝑘2 This, logically, implies that every failure slows down convergence with the error incurred by the initialization. The details of the proof are provided in Appendix B. 5. Evaluation In this section we extensively evaluate CheckFree and CheckFree+ on models ranging from 124M to 1.5B (details of each model can be found in Appendix A.1). We demonstrate that our solutions outperform the state of the art in terms of failure recovery and does not suffer from significant decrease in convergence, despite incurring lower storage and computation cost compared to existing failure recovery strategies. Setup. We perform our tests on private cluster of H100 GPUs. Communication delays between nodes is simulated based on realistic bandwidth and latency measurements between 5 geo-distributed locations from Google Cloud. We use the rates of 5%, 10%, or 16% as the probability of stage failure within an hour. These values are inspired from Bamboo Thorpe et al. (2023) where they use double of these failure rates per node, while for us they represent stage failures. 4 This is very challenging churn rate to deal with in real systems. Baselines. We compare against two baselines - checkpointing and redundant computation. For checkpointing we create checkpoints for the small models every 50 iterations and for the medium models every 100 iterations (roughly corresponding to every 3 hours, as per Scao et al. (2022)). We investigate the effects of checkpointing frequency on convergence in Fig 4b. For redundant computation, each stage computes redundantly the next stage in the forward pass as per Thorpe et al. (2023). To account for the higher memory requirement, we use half the microbatch size, but double the microbatch count, thus keeping the same batch size. Details of all experiments can be found in Appendix A. 4These probabilities could be significantly lower. Under the assumption that there are 𝑘 devices each with an independent probability of disconnecting 𝑝, the chance of an entire stage failing is 𝑝𝑘. However, in practice one would use datacenter responsible per stage in distributed training since then the data parallel communication latency is significantly lower. Thus, failure of stage is plausible if the datacenter becomes fully occupied and spot instances simultaneously become unavailable. 7 All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints (a) Small model at 10% failure rate. (b) Medium model at 10% failure rate. Figure 3 Convergence of small and medium model sizes under 10% failure rate.

In these experiments we focus on the 500M models, splitting them across 7 stages - 1 hosting the embedding and deembedding layers and stages each holding the same number of transformer blocks (per experiment these are detailed in Appendix A.1). All nodes, except for those in the first stage (holding and 1) can fail. We perform the throughput tests for 500 iterations, simulating the failures of different stages across iterations, so that the failure patterns between tests are the same. In Table 2, we report iteration and train time (how long until given validation loss is reached). The reported train time is the wall clock time needed to reach the \"converged\" iterations reported in Fig. 3. We observe similar iteration time as checkpointing as the frequency of checkpointing is high enough that it does not impact iteration time. Combining the number of iterations needed to reach the convergence Fig. 3, checkpointing experiences significantly higher train time due to the need to restart training. CheckFree+ requires higher number than redundant computing and lower number than checkpointing. Due to lower iteration time for CheckFree+ and CheckFree, the resulting tain time of redundant computing is higher. Thus, our solution demonstrates clear improvement in performance, being 12% faster at 5% failure rate than redundant computation and significantly faster than checkpointing. Additionally, our method has better scalability than redundant computation in low-bandwidth networks and higher models, due to the minimal overhead. Also, in case of stage failure, the recovery time of that stage is around 30 seconds. 5.2. Ablation Study Here we investigate the effects of several components individually on models convergence with various hyperparameters and failure rates. Varying model sizes.

(2019), and (large) 1.5B LLaMa with the RedPyjamas dataset Weber et al. (2024). For the small and medium experiments we fix the crash rate at 10%. For the large ones we use crash rate of 16% to demonstrate that even at highly challenging churn rates our method can produce viable results. We evaluate 4 recovery strategies - checkpointing, redundant computation, CheckFree and CheckFree+. We present the results of the small and medium models in Fig. 3. These figures demonstrate that for different model sizes, our solution is superior to checkpointing convergence-wise and can still converge. Note that the figures plot over iteration count, not wall-clock time. As such, despite redundant computation converging faster in terms of iterations, they incur high overhead, which decreases their throughputs. The results of the large model are presented in Fig. 5a, as they werent trained to convergence for CheckFree. While our solution does converge slower iteration-wise than redundant computation, it significantly outperforms it wall-clock-wise. Varying failure frequency. One important question to consider is how our method scales with different failure frequencies. Here we investigate this by repeating the tests on the medium (500M) model in 3 settings - 5%, 10%, and 16% stage failure chance. We summarize the results in Fig. 4a. As expected, CheckFree+ performs the best in low-failure settings. Yet, it can be seen that the performance (validation loss) slightly degrades even when the failure rate is tripled, which demonstrates the robustness of our recovery method. 9 All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints Table 3 Evaluation perplexity on 1.5B models trained for 38K iterations.

(2022)). higher checkpointing rate is expected to yield better convergence results (due to the significantly smaller loss of training) but incurs higher communication overhead to send the model weights to the external non-faulty storage. Here, we investigate the empirical tradeoff of checkpointing strategies, against the proposed CheckFree+. We repeat the experiments of the medium model, comparing against 3 checkpointing frequencies - every 10, every 50, and every 100 iterations, at 10% failure chance. The results are plotted in Fig. 4b. We observe that our solution outperforms even high frequency checkpointing (every 10 iterations) case, due to the need to rollback the model after every failure with checkpointing. Effects of swapping on convergence. While CheckFree+ performs well in settings with failures, it incurs non-negligible affect to its convergence in 0% failure chance, due to the swapping. Here we empirically quantify this effect on medium model. We compare the convergence of model trained with and without swapping. The results are plotted in Fig. 5b. We observe significant slowdown in convergence when swapping is used. 5.3. Model evaluation We evaluate the large model trained via our recovery method against model trained by traditional training without failures (equivalent to redundant computation in convergence), both trained to the same iteration count. We evaluate the perplexity of the foundational models across four different datasets - OpenWebText Gokaslan et al. (2019) and Common Crawl, Stack Exchange, and Arxiv as present in Computer (2023). We present the results in Table 3. We see similar performance between model trained with no faults and with our recovery strategy, despite the drastically different resultant weights. The difference in performance could be improved with further training, as redundant computation requires much higher wall-clock time to reach the same iteration count. 6. Conclusion Failure recovery is critical for enabling training of LLMs in distributed setting on wimpy computing nodes with relatively high failure rates. Prior art recovers stage failures within pipeline through redundant computation or checkpointing. We propose CheckFreea recovery algorithm which recovers stage failures by reinitializing the failed (or lost) weights with the weighted average of the weights of the neighboring stages. We further extend the protocol with CheckFree+ to tolerate first and last stage failures, via out of order pipelining. CheckFree exploits the inherent resilience of LLMs to layer omissions and efficient layer initialization techniques to recover from challenging stage loss faults, while requiring no non-faulty storage and no redundant computation. We extensively demonstrate the convergence of our method via empirical tests. We evaluate the effectiveness of CheckFree on LLaMa models of different sizes, showing that such lightweight recovery reduces the training time compared to the state of the art in 5% stage churn rate by over 12%. CheckFree+ also exhibits robust and steady convergence results for varying failure frequencies. 10 All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints While we assume that stage failures occur uniformly across stages with pre-specified failure rate, the proposed solutions CheckFree and CheckFree+ unfortunately cannot recover from cases of consecutive stages failing together, as there is no neighboring stages for the reinitialization strategy. We believe that extending our methods with lightweight checkpointing scheme will address this limitation and will explore this extension in our future work. Moreover, we will work on improving the convergence of our methods (especially CheckFree+) in non-faulty case to reduce the number of iterations required for training."

Reproducibility information This section describes relevant information for reproducing our results. A.1. Models We train three different model sizes, all of the LLaMa family. We provide details of their hyperparameters in Table 4. Table 4 Model hyperparameters.

Hardware For convergence tests we run on 2, 4, and 8 H100s for the small, medium, and large models respectively. We simulate the faults on recoveries across nodes without actual communication (other than data-parralel aggregation) to speed up iteration time. This has no difference from test performed on geo-distributed nodes, except that runtime will be longer wall-clock wise due to the communication overhead. Small models converged in roughly 8 hours, medium - in 2 days, and large models - in 2 weeks. For throughput results we test on 8 H100s spawning 20 separate nodes. Communication between all 20 nodes is simulated based on realistic latency and bandwidth taken from profiling Google Cloud nodes in 5 different locations. Thus our results on throughput accurately reflect real deployment situation on geo-distributed nodes. A.5. Different initialization strategies For these experiments we trained the medium models on the OpenWebText dataset, allowing for any stage (but those holding embedding and de-embedding) to crash with probability of 16%. We test three All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints different strategies - random (randomly initializing the new strategy), copying (copying the previous layer), and weighted gradient averaging. B. Extended Proof From the assumptions given in the main body, it follows: F𝑡 𝑡 2 = F𝑡 𝑚 F𝑡 + 𝑚 F𝑡 𝑡 2 Where 𝑚 this time selects all layers that are the same (non-failed ones). F𝑡 𝑚 F𝑡 + 𝑚 F𝑡 𝑡 2 𝑡 2) 𝛿(𝜔1 𝑓𝑘+1 + 𝜔2 𝑓𝑘12 𝑓𝑘2) 1F𝑡 2 𝛿2 𝑡 2 𝛿 2F 𝛿(F𝑡 2 We can divide the training past random failure of model F0 into two parts - standard optimization with the modified model and post-recovery reduction error: 𝑡 𝔼F 𝑡1 F02 = 𝑡 𝔼F 𝑡1 0 + 0 F02 𝑡 𝔼F 𝑡1 0 2 + 𝑡 𝔼F 0 F02 The left hand side is standard optimization problem. This depends on the optimizer, but here we will asusme it convergences inversely proportional to 𝑡 - ( 1 𝑡 ). The right hand is the error due to replacement of stages. What this tells us is that if the error is small, the convergence is not as affected (which intuitively makes sense). The right side can be rewritten as: 𝜔1 𝑓𝑘+1 + 𝜔2 𝑓𝑘1 𝑓𝑘2, thus: 𝑡 𝔼F 𝑡1 F02 ( 1 𝑡 ) + 𝑡 2𝔼𝜔1 𝑓𝑘+1 + 𝜔2 𝑓𝑘1 𝑓𝑘2 QED."
