            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained to predict the next token using massive amounts of web-crawled text, implicitly learning wide range of tasks (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023; Dubey et al., 2024). To align them with human needs, LLMs typically undergo Instruction Tuning (IT) (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022)a supervised fine-tuning process using instruction-response paired data. This conditional supervision enables them to follow natural language instructions and responsibly handle unsafe queries, facilitating their real-world applications (Wang et al., 2023a;b; Ivison et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Bianchi et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024). We note that LLMs might acquire abilities such as instruction-following and safety assessment during pre-training, as well as the extensive knowledge required to perform specific tasks (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024). Moreover, previous observations suggest that output space information plays crucial role in canonical NLP tasks (Min et al., 2022; Kung & Peng, 2023). Our hypothesis is that establishing an adequate output space can surface these capabilities in the form of responses, enabling pre-trained LLMs to function as desired chat assistants. In this study, we explore the impact of establishing response space in transforming pre-trained LLMs into helpful and safe assistants. To this end, we propose Response Tuning (RT), which focuses solely on response space supervision. Specifically, RT omits the instruction-conditioning process and the model is not supervised from instruction-response mappings (see Figure 1). Instead, it trains the model to construct responses and learn their distribution. This omission allows us to examine the isolated effect of response supervision. We first investigate whether establishing an output space alone can enable LLMs to generate aligned responses without additional supervision from instruction-response mappings. To this end, we evaluate the instructability of RT models trained on four recent LLMs using three different datasets: Llama-3.1-8B (Dubey et al., 2024), Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B (Riviere et al., 2024), and Mistral-7B-v0.3 (Jiang et al., 2023), utilizing only the responses from Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), 1Codes are available at https://github.com/seokhyunan/response-tuning."

Unlike IT, RT does not involve instruction conditioning and focuses solely on learning the distribution of responses. Dolly (Conover et al., 2023), and LIMA (Zhou et al., 2024). Our human and automatic evaluations, based on test instructions derived from multiple sources (Li et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024), show that RT models can appropriately respond to wide range of instructions and exhibit preference comparable to their IT counterparts. They also demonstrate core capabilities (reasoning, knowledge, etc.) on par with those of their counterparts. These findings suggest that instruction-following capabilities are largely acquired during pre-training and that establishing an appropriate response space can yield instruction-following assistants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that controlling the training response distribution can achieve the target alignment. Specifically, we observe that refining the structural attributes of the training responses leads to significant improvements in user preference, enabling the models to assist users more effectively. Moreover, we find that incorporating small set of contextual refusalswhich embed guidance for handling unsafe queriesinto the RT data allows RT models to implicitly evaluate and reject unsafe queries. When tested using multiple safety benchmarks (Zou et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024; Mazeika et al., 2024; Rottger et al., 2024), these models exhibit refusal rates comparable to IT counterparts trained with paired examples. Additionally, these phenomena become more pronounced as the base models capabilities scale. These findings suggest that strong base LLMs can acquire complex capabilities during pre-training and that adequately embedding behavioral guidance into the response space can invoke target behaviors. Finally, we show that our observations still hold in an in-context learning setting. We demonstrate that in-context learning with response demonstrations only can yield helpful and safe assistants, further supporting our hypothesis. Our work highlights the impact of establishing desired response distribution in LLM alignment and emphasizes the extensive inherent capabilities of pre-trained LLMs. In summary: 1. We hypothesize that establishing an appropriate output space may enable pre-trained LLMs to become instruction-following and safe assistants. To verify this, we propose Response Tuning (RT), which does not involve instruction-conditioning and focuses on learning the response distribution. 2. Our extensive evaluations show that RT models, trained solely using responses, can effectively respond to wide range of instructions. This indicates that instruction-following capabilities are largely acquired during pre-training and establishing an output space can yield instructionfollowing assistants. 3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the target alignment can be achieved by controlling the training response distribution. Notably, we demonstrate that refining the structural attributes of responses and incorporating small number of contextual refusals can improve user preference and safety, respectively."

Recent studies, expanding from earlier research that focused on cross-task generalization across canonical NLP tasks (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022), have shifted their focus to generalization for unseen user instructions, demonstrating remarkable success in improving the usability of LLMs. Notable contributions include synthetic data generation frameworks (Wang et al., 2023b; Honovich et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024), human-involved conversation collection schemes (Conover et al., 2023; Kopf et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024), and efficient training techniques (Zhou et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024). However, few controlled studies have investigated the impact of specific learning signals on producing instruction-following assistants. Large Language Model safety. Instruction-following LLMs are susceptible to malicious use without proper safeguards, and their risks become more nuanced and pronounced as their capabilities grow (Bommasani et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2023). This has motivated studies on safety measures to mitigate their potential risks in real-world applications (Perez et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022b; Dubey et al., 2024; Mu et al., 2024). These measures typically aim to make the model refuse to answer unsafe queriessuch as requests for assistance in committing illegal activitieswhile retaining their helpfulness in appropriate contexts. common practice to achieve this is incorporating unsafe instruction-refusal response pairs into the IT stage (Touvron et al., 2023; Bianchi et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024). However, as with instruction-following alignment, it remains unclear which cues mainly elicit the desired behaviors. Supervision from input-output pairs. Min et al. (2022) show that the input-output mapping matters significantly less than the label space information in the in-context demonstrations of canonical NLP tasks (e.g., classification). Taking step further, later works examine the role of task definitions given in the prompts of the IT dataset and demonstrate that models trained with minimal (only label space) or misleading task definitions have little effect on their task generalization performance (Kung & Peng, 2023). However, those findings are limited to conventional label spaces, which correspond to predefined categories or outputs expected in given NLP tasks (e.g., yes/no, positive/negative), rather than the open-ended output space in open-domain IT. Our approach. To address these gaps, we aim to examine the impact of supervision from the response distribution in alignment. Specifically, we focus on open-domain, open-ended ITa widely adopted practice in aligning both open-source and proprietary LLMs (Wang et al., 2023a; Kopf et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Dubey et al., 2024; Riviere et al., 2024). Our focus lies on two foundational objectives of LLM alignment: transforming pre-trained LLMs into instruction-following and safe assistants."

We adopt the chatbot-style schema proposed by Wang et al. (2023a), which separates user instructions and assistant responses using special tokens: <user> and <assistant>. However, in RT, we omit both the <user> token and the user instructions during training. Therefore, the training data consists only of the <assistant> token followed by the training response. Training. RT employs standard teacher forcing and computes the loss only on the response tokens that appear after the <assistant> token.

The indicator function δi equals 1 if the i-th token belongs to the response set (i.e., the assistants response), and 0 otherwise. This formulation mirrors the loss function used in IT, where loss masking is applied to instruction tokens (Wang et al., 2023b; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a; Dettmers et al., 2024). However, unlike IT, RT does not condition the response tokens on the paired instructions, allowing the model to focus on learning the distribution of responses independently. Inference. We input sequence that starts with the instruction delimiter (<user>), followed by the users instruction, and then the response delimiter (<assistant>). The model then generates the assistants response after the <assistant> token. Although the RT models are trained without paired instructions, they can leverage their inherent capabilities to generate desired responses. We will demonstrate this in the subsequent experiment sections."

We first assess their open-ended instruction-following capabilities to determine whether they can handle typical user queries in realworld applications (e.g., creative writing, trip planning, and general question-answering). Additionally, we test their core capabilities needed to perform instructed tasks using multiple benchmarks. For reliable verification, we conduct both human and automatic evaluations. 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP Pre-trained LLMs. We use four recent open-source LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B (Dubey et al., 2024), Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B (Riviere et al., 2024), and Mistral-7B-v0.3 (Jiang et al., 2023). These models are widely adopted due to their high performance, steerability, and efficiency. In this section, we mainly report results for Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-9B; results for the other models are provided in Appendix C. Training dataset. To account for potential dataset dependency of RT, we use three different IT datasets, from which we only use the response subsets: Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023): dataset of 52,000 instruction-response pairs generated through the Self-Instruct(Wang et al., 2023b) framework. We use its cleaned version, which fixes issues in the original dataset with the updated GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) generation backbone.2 Dolly (Conover et al., 2023): dataset of 15,000 instruction-response pairs manually crafted by human annotators. LIMA (Zhou et al., 2024): dataset of 1,000 instruction-response pairs curated from various sources, including web data from Stack Exchange, wikiHow, and Reddit, as well as examples manually written by the authors and sourced from Super-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022). Training setup. We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2024), which has been shown to match the performance of full 16-bit fine-tuning while significantly reducing memory footprint. LoRA adapters (Hu et al., 2022) are applied to all linear layers and are double-quantized in 4-bit NormalFloat during training. We set the alpha, rank, and dropout rate of the adapters to 16, 64, and 0.1, respectively. 32-bit paged AdamW optimizer (Dettmers et al., 2024) is used with batch size of 64 and constant learning rate of 1e-4 (Wang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a). Models are trained for 10 epochs with maximum token length of 2,048 using NVIDIA A6000 (48GB VRAM) or A100 (80GB VRAM) GPUs. We use vLLM with greedy decoding for generation (Kwon et al., 2023). This setup is applied to all experiments unless otherwise specified. Instructabiltiy evaluation. To determine whether RT models can handle user instructions, we independently assess their responses acceptability and quality. Additionally, we conduct pairwise assessments to measure their preference compared to their IT counterparts. 2https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahma/alpaca-cleaned"

The test is conducted using 800 regular instructions from the JustEval benchmark (Lin et al., 2024). The results indicate that RT models achieve performance close to IT models across all metrics. Independent Assessment: To evaluate the acceptability of open-ended responses from RT models, we conduct human evaluation. We use the test instructions from AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023), mixture of five distinct evaluation datasets covering wide range of instructions (Wang et al., 2023b; Kopf et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022a; Chiang et al., 2023; Geng et al., 2023). Evaluators are presented with an instruction and the corresponding model response, and are asked to rate the responses by choosing one of three options: Acceptable (Excellent), Acceptable (Sufficient), or Not Acceptable. To address the limitations of human evaluators (Gudibande et al., 2024), we also conduct fine-grained response quality evaluation using the JustEval benchmark (Lin et al., 2024), which utilizes GPT-4 judge. The evaluation interface, guidelines, and prompts can be found in Appendix A. Pairwise Assessment: We conduct both human and automatic evaluations using the AlpacaEval test instructions. Human evaluators are asked to choose the more helpful response or indicate Tie, given the instruction and responses from both the RT model and its IT counterpart. For automatic evaluation, we utilize the GPT-4 judge of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Li et al., 2023) and report length-controlled win rates (Dubois et al., 2024). This evaluator exhibits high Spearman correlation (Spearman, 1904) of 0.98 with human evaluators in Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024). Core capabilities evaluation. Recent work argues that general-purpose assistant should be able to perform core tasks to ensure practicality (Wang et al., 2023a). To measure the core capabilities of RT models, we conduct automated evaluations using multiple benchmarks designed to assess specific skills.

Figures 2, 3 and 4 depict the human acceptability, response quality, and pairwise helpfulness assessment results, respectively. The independent assessment results indicate that RT models, trained only using responses without paired instructions, are capable of generating appropriate responses to wide range of instructions. significant majority of the responses generated by RT models are rated as Acceptable, with many achieving the Excellent rating. They perform comparably to their IT counterparts in response quality evaluations, achieving similar scores across all metrics of the JustEval benchmark. The pairwise evaluation results also show that RT models exhibit competent, though slightly inferior, preference compared to their IT counterparts. This trend remains consistent across four different base LLMs and three different datasets. These findings suggest that the instruction-response dynamics are largely acquired during pre-training, and just establishing response space can elicit those dynamics to generate aligned responses. The examples of the model outputs are available in Appendix E. RT models exhibit core capabilities on par with IT models. Table 1 displays the core capabilities evaluation results. While there exist some fluctuations due to the nature of fine-tuning (Fu et al., 2024), we find no significant differences between the performance of RT and IT models across all tasks tested. These results indicate that RT models can comprehend inputs, adhere to constraints to yield answers in zero-shot setting, and possess core capabilities comparable to IT models. These core capabilities that RT models retain from pre-trained models can serve as the foundation in assisting users with diverse requests. Additionally, it supports previous findings that input-output mappings do not significantly impact end performance and that most knowledge required for specific tasks is acquired during pre-training (Kung & Peng, 2023; Zhou et al., 2024). Instruction-following capabilities are better internalized in stronger LLMs. Table 2 shows the evaluation results for RT Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B models. While smaller models like Gemma-2-2B generate highly acceptable responses, larger models such as Gemma-2-9B, which are pre-trained on significantly more tokens (2T vs. 8T tokens), exhibit higher human acceptance rates and preferences against IT counterparts. This suggests that stronger models are better at learning instruction-following capabilities during pre-training."

Our preceding experiments demonstrate that establishing response space alone can enable LLMs to behave as instruction-following assistants. In this section, we investigate whether refining the training response distribution can further enhance user preference, which is one of the essential objectives of LLM alignment. While previous works have shown that techniques like feedback learning or completely regenerating responses in the IT dataset using other aligned LLMs can improve user preference (Bai et al., 2022a; Peng et al., 2023; Ivison et al., 2024), we are interested in verifying whether adjusting the inherent attributes of existing response distributions in IT or RT data can yield similar benefits. 5.2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP Response refinement. We focus on refining the inherent attributes of the response space, specifically considering three core elements that correlate with user preference: clarity, structure, and tone. For the refinement, we utilize strong instruction-following LLM, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024), with manually designed refinement prompt. The responses from the Alpaca, Dolly, and LIMA datasets are refined according to the following guidelines: Clarity: Make the response easy to understand. It should be direct and to the point, avoiding complex language that might confuse the user Structure: Organize the content in logical and coherent manner. The response should flow naturally, making it easy for the user to follow along and grasp the key points. Tone: Adjust the tone to be friendly, conversational, and engaging. The response should feel approachable and enjoyable, as if having pleasant conversation with the user. The prompt and the example of refined data are available in Appendix and D. Evaluation. We conduct simulated preference evaluations using the GPT-4 judge of AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023) and report length-controlled win rates (Dubois et al., 2024). To directly measure the gains from response space refinement, we compare both the IT and RT models trained using the refined datasets with those trained on the original datasets. 5.3 RESULTS Refined response distribution yields models with better user preference. As shown in Table 3, the pairwise evaluation results indicate that both IT and RT models trained with the refined responses significantly outperform their counterparts trained on the original responses.

Similar to instruction-following alignment, recent work demonstrates that incorporating only small set of safety-focused examplesunsafe queries paired with refusal responsesinto IT data can enable models to reject unsafe inputs (Bianchi et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). On the other hand, our previous experiments have shown the abilities like instruction-following are also acquired during pre-training. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the risk assessment capabilities required to evaluate the risk of queries are also acquired during pre-training. Therefore, we investigate whether properly establishing the response spaceby including refusal responses that demonstrate how to handle unsafe queriescan induce responsible behaviors even without using paired data. 6.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP Response tuning with refusals. We incorporate contextual refusalswhich express an inability to assist along with reason explaining how the model should handle unsafe queriesinto the response subsets of Alpaca, Dolly, and LIMA datasets. These refusals are obtained from existing safety-focused pairs using pattern matching (Bianchi et al., 2024).

We measure the Refusal Rate (RR) against unsafe queries using benchmarks such as AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), MaliciousInstruct (Huang et al., 2024), HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), and XSTest (Rottger et al., 2024). To consider exaggerated safety (over refusal) behaviors, we also measure the False Refusal Rate (FRR) using benign queries from XSTest that are lexically similar to unsafe ones (Rottger et al., 2024). Existing methods for evaluating refusals often involve significant costs, require human effort, or cannot measure FRR. Therefore, we utilize cost-efficient, open-source LLMLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024)to classify whether response is refusal or compliance, i.e., whether the response declines to assist or attempts to provide the requested information. However, our initial manual inspection found that simply instructing the model to perform this classification yields poor performance due to tricky cases: Deceptive compliance for unsafe queries: Cases where the model (1) starts with disclaimers, warnings, or expressions of hesitation but still attempts to provide the requested information; (2) initially refuses to answer but continues to provide the requested unsafe information; (3) assumes hypothetical scenarios and provides the unsafe information requested. Soft refusals for unsafe queries: Cases where the models provide alternative suggestions or advice instead of directly refusing the request. To address these issues, we designed universal and reliable judge prompt (see Appendix A). This judge is validated using set of 120 examples consisting of 60 compliance and 60 refusal responses, each containing 30 of the edge cases described above. Our engineered prompt, which induces chainof-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b), achieved 98.33% accuracy on this test set. We use this judge for all safety evaluations. 6.2 RESULTS Response supervision alone can elicit responsible behaviors. Figure 5 shows the evaluation results for the Gemma-2-9B model trained based on LIMA. The results for the other models and datasets are available in Appendix C. Notably, RT models trained with refusals exhibit substantially higher RR compared to those trained without refusals, indicating that they are able to handle unsafe queries as suggested in training responses. We also find that their FRR falls within reasonable range. Although they require more data to achieve safety level close to IT counterparts, their refusal rates are largely on par with IT counterparts that are additionally supervised from mappings between unsafe queries and refusals. These results indicate that complex capabilities, such as safety assessment, are largely acquired during pre-training. LLMs can generalize the guidance for handling queries embedded in the training response distribution even without supervision from explicit instruction-response mappings. The gap in refusal rates between RT and IT models shrinks with model scale. Our experiments using Gemma-2-9B and Gemma-2-2B models reveal that the difference in safety performance between RT and IT models diminishes as the size of the base model increases. While smaller models like Gemma-2-2B show noticeable gapwith IT models outperforming RT models in RRlarger models such as Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-9B exhibit minimal differences. In some cases, the larger RT models achieve refusal rates comparable to their IT counterparts. This suggests that larger models have greater capacity to internalize and generalize safety behaviors from limited response supervision. Please refer to Appendix for the detailed numerical report. 7 IN-CONTEXT RESPONSE LEARNING Motivation. We further validate our hypothesisthat establishing an appropriate output space alone can enable LLMs to behave as desired chat assistantsin an in-context learning setting. To this end, we test whether untuned base LLMs can helpfully and safely respond to user queries given only response demonstrations. Experimental setup. We remove instruction-response mappings from URIAL (Lin et al., 2024), which consists of 4 instruction-response pairs including one pair of unsafe instruction and refusal. We refer to this new version as URIAL-R. We then evaluate these models using two different base"

The test is conducted using the 1,000 test instructions from the JustEval benchmark, including the safety test set. The results show that URIAL-R achieves similar performance to URIAL across all metrics in both base models, despite not being prompted with instruction-response mappings. LLMs, Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-9B, with the JustEval benchmark. We employ greedy decoding with maximum generation length of 2,048 tokens. To further elucidate the importance of response supervision, we include zero-shot templated prompting (Lin et al., 2024) as baseline in our evaluation. The prompts and details of the setup can be found in Appendix A. Results. Figure 6 presents the evaluation results. The findings indicate that the base LLM, when provided with the URIAL-R prompt containing only response demonstrations, performs comparably to the model prompted with the original URIAL, which includes instruction-response pairs. The scores across all metrics are similar between the two prompts. Additionally, URIAL-R significantly outperforms the zero-shot prompting baselines across all metrics. These results demonstrate that response demonstrations alone can elicit helpful and safe assistant behaviors in LLMs, highlighting the impact of supervision from response distribution and latent capabilities of pre-trained LLMs. This reinforces our earlier conclusion that the capabilities required to behave as chat assistants are largely inherent in pre-trained LLMs and can be activated without explicit supervision from instruction-response mappings."

            "title": "8 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "In this paper, we explore the role of establishing an output space in transforming pre-trained LLMs into instruction-following and safe assistants. We propose Response Tuning (RT), method that focuses solely on response space supervision by eliminating the instruction-conditioning step in instruction tuning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RT models, trained only on responses without paired instructions, effectively respond to wide range of user queries and responsibly handle unsafe requests by generalizing embedded behavioral guidance in the response space. These findings suggest that many of the capabilities required for alignment are already inherent in pretrained models and can be activated by establishing proper response space. Our work emphasizes the impact of output space supervision in alignment and highlights the potential of inherent capabilities in LLMs. LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK Our study focuses on the core objectives of LLM alignmentinstruction-following and safety. Future work could explore controlling response distribution to achieve more complex alignment objectives, such as mitigating sycophancy or social bias (Perez et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2024). Additionally, our work relies on empirical results from the ablation study; direct investigations into the inherent capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, such as extracting their semantic features (Bricken et al., 2023; Templeton et al., 2024), could further clarify the role of the alignment stage and potentially improve efficiency. Moreover, future research might adopt analytical approaches for automatic selection or fine-grained control over the response distribution to achieve better alignment."

The authors manually reviewed the LLM responses flagged by OpenAI moderation API and confirmed that these pose no harm to human evaluators. In addition, evaluators had the right to immediately stop the evaluation if they wished, and were encouraged to discuss any discomfort with the authors. This work is dedicated to understanding the LLMs safety alignment stage. While we publicly release the codes for safety evaluations, we decide not to release the refusal judge validation set to prevent potential misuse of unsafe or illegal information."

            "content": "A.1 HUMAN EVALUATION Human participants. We employ three undergraduate students at university where the official language is English. To prevent potential harm to the human evaluators, we manually review the LLM responses flagged by OpenAI Moderation API and confirm that these pose no harm to the human evaluators (400 out of 22,540 of the responses (1.77 %) are flagged). Additionally, the human evaluators can stop the evaluation at any time and are encouraged to contact the authors immediately if they experience any discomfort. Response acceptability evaluation. Table 4 and Figure 7 present the evaluation guidelines and annotation interface, respectively. Human raters are given two models responses at once and are asked to rate each response independently by choosing one of three ratings: Acceptable (Excellent), Acceptable (Sufficient), or Not Acceptable. The order of the model responses is internally randomized at each turn to avoid potential evaluation bias. Response preference evaluation. The preference evaluation is conducted simultaneously with the acceptability evaluation. Evaluators are instructed to choose the response they find more helpful. The annotation interface is shown in Figure 7. A.2 AUTOMATIC EVALUATIONS Response quality evaluation. We use the test instructions and the LLM judge from the JustEval benchmark (Lin et al., 2024). For models without safeguards, we perform only the regular evaluation using 800 instructions. The evaluation conducted in Section 7 involves safety measures, so we also use the safety evaluation suite. The evaluation prompt can be found in their official implementation. Pairwise preference evaluation. We use the weighted alpaca eval gpt4 turbo judge from AlpacaEval 2.0 (Li et al., 2023) for the automatic preference evaluation and report lengthcontrolled win rates (Dubois et al., 2024). The evaluation prompt can be found in their official repository.5 Core capabilities evaluation. We measure the core capabilities of the models as follows: MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021): We use the script from the open-instruct repository (Ivison et al., 2023) for evaluation.6 Exact-match accuracy is reported in zero-shot setting. OpenbookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018): We evaluate using the Language Model Evaluation Harness (lm-eval) package (Gao et al., 2024), reporting exact-match accuracy in zero-shot setting. HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019): We evaluate with the lm-eval package, measuring exactmatch accuracy in zero-shot setting. ARC (Clark et al., 2018): We use the lm-eval package to measure exact-match accuracy in zero-shot setting. GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021): We evaluate using the lm-eval package. Following the setup of Dubey et al. (2024), we use 8-shot demonstrations in multi-turn chat format and report exact-match accuracy. PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020): We use the lm-eval package for evaluation, measuring exact-match accuracy in zero-shot setting. Safety evaluation. We evaluate the safety of models by measuring the refusal rates for unsafe instructions and false refusal rates for benign instructions using multiple safety benchmarks.

We observe the refined response exhibits improved coherence. Query Why are the lights inside commercial airplanes turned off during take off and landing? Original LIMA Response This is for safety reasons. Take-off and landing are the two most critical phases of flight and thus, every additional step to ensure survivability, be it even just adjusting the light, is taken. The interior lights or cabin lights are adjusted to match the exterior environment, so that in case of an emergency, especially if the interior lights fail, your eyes are already accustomed to the light setting and you do not require additional valuable seconds for adjustment to possibly darker or brighter environment. The lights are usually adjusted at dusk, night or dawn to match the exterior environment. If the cabin lights do not fail during an emergency, the dimmed light also makes it easier to identify the EXIT signs which illuminate and make the guidance lighting on the floor easier to follow. The bright emergency lighting is more prominent to identify when the cabin light is dimmed, saving valuable seconds as the aircraft is evacuated. This also ties in with having to raise the blinds on the windows. The blinds need to be raised during take-off and landing irrespective of the outside light situation, however, with darker cabin, any outside light source, especially from fires or other hazards is easier to identify by the crew, making the decision process of whether one side could be inappropriate to use for evacuation faster, e.g. fire on port side > no evacuation on that side. The blinds are therefore raised to allow better view for cabin crew of the outside area and external aircraft parts, such as engines, wings, etc. Refined LIMA Response When youre on commercial flight, you might have noticed that the lights inside the plane are turned off or dimmed during takeoff and landing. This is done for safety reasons, as these are the most critical phases of flight. The main reason for adjusting the interior lights is to help your eyes adjust to the outside environment. In case of an emergency, if the interior lights fail, your eyes will already be accustomed to the light setting, and you wont need extra time to adjust. This is especially important during dusk, night, or dawn when the outside light is changing. Dimming the cabin lights also makes it easier to see the illuminated EXIT signs and the guidance lighting on the floor. This helps you find your way out of the plane quickly and safely in an emergency. Another reason for dimming the lights is to help the crew identify any potential hazards outside the plane. When the cabin is darker, any outside light sources, such as fires, are easier to spot. This helps the crew make faster decisions about which side of the plane is safe to use for evacuation. Thats also why youre asked to raise the window blinds during takeoff and landing. This allows the cabin crew to get better view of the outside area, including the engines, wings, and other important parts of the plane. By doing so, they can respond more quickly and effectively in case of an emergency."

Query Could you explain how the fermentation process of kimchi works and what health benefits it offers? Mistral-7B-v0.3 + ITDolly Kimchi is traditional Korean side dish that is made of salted and spiced vegetables. The most popular vegetable used to make kimchi is napa cabbage. Other vegetables such as radishes, cucumbers, onions, and daikon are also used to make different varieties of kimchi. Kimchi is typically fermented for several weeks or even months to develop flavor and improve its health benefits.
