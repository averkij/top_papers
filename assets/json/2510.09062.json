            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to produce extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces have achieved strong performance on complex tasks such as math problem solving. These models are often referred to as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) (Guo et al., 2025; Jaech et al., 2024). Recent progress on LRMs has largely targeted efficiency and accuracy, e.g., inference-time strategies and fine-tuning methods to shorten the reasoning length or boost accuracy (Sui et al., 2025; Muennighoff et al., 2025; Hao et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2025). However, this line of work typically treats CoT as means to improve task performance rather than as communication medium for users to audit and understand model behavior. As result, traces can be verbose or irregular, and their interpretability for humans remains underexplored. Beyond interpretability, two additional issues further undermine trust in current systems. First, CoTs are often not faithful to the models actual decision process, omitting the shortcuts or cues that truly drive predictions (Chen et al., 2025). Second, reasoning models frequently fabricate plausiblelooking derivations even when unable to solve the problem, producing long traces where errors or nonsensical steps are difficult for humans to detect. They typically offer no self-assessment of reasoning quality, or when prompted to do so, exhibit overconfidence that fails to reflect true accuracy (Mei et al., 2025). Together, these shortcomings undermine the reliability of LRMs. We argue that progress in reasoning should be assessed not only by accuracy and efficiency, but by trustworthy reasoning along three dimensionsInterpretability, Faithfulness, and Reliability."

            "content": "Specifically, interpretability concerns human-readable, structurally coherent traces that support verification; faithfulness requires that verbalized steps reflect causal factors driving predictions; reliability demands well-calibrated confidence and predictable failure behavior. We formalize these dimensions in Section 2. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce ReFIne, new training framework for trustworthy reasoning. ReFIne guides models to produce reasoning traces that are clearly structured and easier for humans to verify (interpretability), explicitly list all conditions and reference them in subsequent steps (faithfulness), and perform self-assessment by evaluating the soundness of their reasoning and assigning confidence score to the final answer (reliability). In this way, ReFIne addresses interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability together, rather than optimizing for accuracy alone. Our contributions are as follows: We define trustworthy reasoning for LRMs concretely through three dimensions interpretability, faithfulness, and reliabilityand use this definition to guide the design of ReFIne, the first training framework explicitly optimized for these principles in LRMs. We show that ReFIne improves interpretability by 44.0%, faithfulness by 18.8%, and reliability by 42.4% across four benchmarks and three model sizes, while achieving similar accuracy and slightly better reasoning efficiency (1.16)."

            "title": "2 TRUSTWORTHY REASONING: DEFINITION AND MOTIVATION",
            "content": "While prior works on LRM have largely emphasized accuracy and efficiency, we argue that reasoning model is trustworthy only if it satisfies the following three dimensions: 1. Interpretability. The reasoning trace should be presented in clear, well-organized structure that allows humans to easily follow the logic, identify key steps, and verify the flow of arguments. This includes providing high-level roadmap at the outset, maintaining coherent progression, explicitly linking steps, and avoiding irrelevant or distracting content. 2. Faithfulness. The reasoning trace should accurately reflect the actual process by which the model arrives at its answer. All conditions that influence the solution, along with any materials or information used, should be stated explicitly. And subsequent steps should be grounded in these stated elements rather than in unstated shortcuts or spurious patterns. 3. Reliability. The model should perform an explicit self-assessment to judge whether each step of its derivation is rigorous. Based on this assessment, it should produce well-calibrated estimate of the likelihood that its final answer is correct, enabling users to know when the answer can be trusted and when caution is needed. Standard CoT outputs often fall short on one or more of these dimensions: they may be readable but poorly structured (Figure 2), omit important factors actually used in decision-making  (Table 2)  , or present overconfident answers without any measure of uncertainty  (Table 4)  . more detailed discussion of these issues is provided in Section 4. In the next section, we adopt the above triad and design ReFIne, new training framework for trustworthy reasoning."

Preparation Phase: i. Problem Understanding, <understanding>: the model restates the task in its own words and clarifies exactly what is being asked. Rationale: improves interpretability by making the problem statement explicit, and supports faithfulness by anchoring the models intended interpretation at the start, reducing the chance of later shifting the problem scope. ii. List Facts, <facts>: the model lists all variables, given conditions, and constraints it will rely on later. Rationale: improves faithfulness by requiring all materials used in the derivation to be stated up front. iii. Stepwise Plan, <plan>: the model builds concise, stepwise strategy before beginning the detailed derivation. Rationale: improves interpretability by providing clear roadmap that helps readers anticipate and follow the solution process. Reasoning Phase, <think>: step-by-step derivation that explicitly references items from <understanding>, <facts>, and steps from <plan>. If the model switches to another approach, it must explicitly identify and explain errors in the previous attempt. Rationale: by grounding the content in earlier sections, the model is more likely to be consistent (faithfulness), and it becomes easier for humans to track which part of the roadmap the model is executing (interpretability). Answer Phase, <final answer>: the final result with brief justification. Evaluation Phase, <self assessment>: short audit of the solutions soundness, followed by an integer confidence score from 0 to 10 indicating the models belief that the final answer is correct. Rationale: supports reliability by revealing which parts of the reasoning are rigorous and which parts are speculative, helping users to decide whether to trust the answer. Given this pipeline, for each math question, we prompt Qwen3-8B to generate each block sequentially with different instructions. The detailed algorithm and prompt templates for each block are provided in Appendix A.1. We construct reasoning traces in the above format using 10,000 problems from the Open-R1-Math dataset (Hugging Face, 2025). Data Filtering and Confidence Debiasing. We first discard examples with incorrect final answers, leaving 8,000 traces; this selection inflates <self assessment> scores si {0, . . . , 10} toward high values. To debias, we remap scores by histogram specification towards target mixture while preserving order. Let the empirical PMF be pemp(s) = 1 i=1 1{si = s}. We conN struct target PMF by mixing it with the uniform distribution ptgt(s) = α pemp(s) + (1 α) 1 11 , (cid:80)N"

This rank-preserving mapping yields marginals that match ptgt up to discretization, increases coverage of low-confidence bins for subsequent RL training. Supervised Finetuning.

We apply GRPO to further reinforce these behaviors. Problem Selection. We select 2,000 problems for GRPO as follows: Let DSFT be the 10,000 problems used in SFT data collection (Section 3.1), we draw 1,400 instances that Qwen3-8B failed to solve correctly, and the remaining 600 problems are randomly sampled from Open-R1-Math while excluding DSFT. This bias toward harder problems limits the number of trivially solvable cases in GRPO, helping prevent the model from developing overconfident behavior. Reward Function.

We first verify structural correctness: whether all required sections appear exactly once and in the canonical order. ReFIne achieves near-perfect compliance, with rates exceeding 99.7% on average. We then examine whether the models main reasoning (<think> section) explicitly points back to earlier sections by emitting the literal tags <understanding>, <facts>, and <plan>. Table 1 reports the percentage of traces satisfying this criterion for each dataset. Compared to the SFT-only ablation (ReFIne w/o GRPO), ReFIne consistently achieves much higher reference rates, indicating that GRPO rewards effectively encouraged this cross-section linking behavior. Readability. We evaluate which model produces reasoning that is easier for humans to follow by conducting pairwise comparison between ReFIne and the Plain baseline across all datasets and model sizes, using QwQ-32B (QwenTeam, 2025) as an automatic judge. Figure 2 shows that in every setting, ReFIne is judged to be clearly better or slightly better than Plain, with only small fraction of cases favoring the baseline. These results confirm that ReFIne consistently produces reasoning traces that are clearer, smoother, and easier to follow. The full evaluation prompt used for readability judgment is provided in Appendix A.2. These evaluations show that ReFIne achieves more organized reasoning process: it explicitly references earlier sections during derivation, attains strong readability scores, and exhibits nearperfect structural compliance. Collectively, this reflects substantial improvement in interpretability."

We attribute this effect partly to the <facts> section, which encourages ReFIne to enumerate all premises (including injected hints) before proceeding with the solution. We also observe that ReFIne achieves 1.35 larger accuracy gains after being hinted and is 1.28 more likely to verbalize the hint compared to Plain across all problems. This indicates that ReFIne both benefits more from new information and discloses its use more transparently. Commitment Faithfulness. This metric evaluates whether the <think> section faithfully follows the models own prior commitments. We again use QwQ-32B to judge three criteria independently: (i) Reasoning based on Understanding: the derivation must align with the problem interpretation stated in <understanding>; (ii) Reasoning based on Facts: only the variables and conditions listed in <facts> may be used, with no unstated or invented premises; (iii) Reasoning based on Plan: the derivation must follow each step in the <plan> exactly, without reordering, omitting, or adding steps. These metrics test whether ReFIne actually does what it has committed to rather than simply producing reasoning that looks well-structured. The prompt we use to query QwQ-32B is provided in Appendix A.3. As shown in Table 3, ReFIne consistently follows its prior interpretation, stated conditions, and high-level plan, suggesting that it is not merely imitating superficial formatting patterns introduced during training."

We evaluate whether confidence separates correct from incorrect answers using AUROC and whether it matches empirical accuracy using ECE. Empirically, AUROC asks: if we sort outputs by stated confidence, how often does correct answer outrank an incorrect one? While ECE asks: for example, do answers with 80% confidence (in our case, verbalized as Confidence: 8/10) actually turn out correct about 80% of the time? Both metrics are computed only on outputs that include an explicit confidence score. As shown in Table 5, ReFIne attains strong discrimination on AIME-2024 and MATH-500 (AUROC > 0.7) and also surpasses Plain on GPQA-Diamond and GSM8K. The seemingly high AUROC for Plain on AIME-2024 is not statistically meaningful, as it stems from extremely low confidence coverage (< 7% of reasoning verbalize confidence, as shown in Table 4); these entries are therefore marked in red. Practically, AUROC > 0.7 can be taken to indicate strong knowwhen-you-know discrimination, accounting for our test data being substantially out-of-distribution. Table 6 further shows that ReFIne is better calibrated (lower ECE) across datasets, with especially large gains on MATH-500 and GSM8K. Overall, ReFIne both verbalizes self-assessment reliably and produces confidence score that better tracks correctness compared to Plain."

            "content": "Reasoning Models. Recent advances in reasoning models have significantly improved the problem-solving abilities of LLMs in domains such as mathematics, coding, and science. OpenAIs o1 (Jaech et al., 2024) represents major shift toward deliberate reasoning by employing reinforcement learning (RL) to refine its strategies. By generating explicit Thinking steps before producing answers, o1 achieves strong performance on complex tasks. As more cost-efficient alternative, DeepSeek-r1 (Guo et al., 2025) demonstrates that pure RL can also effectively enhance reasoning. It introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), novel method that eliminates the need for separate reward model, enabling more efficient RL training. XML-like Tagging in CoT. Prior work augments chain-of-thought reasoning with XML-style tags while keeping the overall reasoning flow largely unchanged. Nguyen et al. (2025) introduces tags that highlight supporting facts by wrapping key spans in the question (e.g., <fact1>...</fact1>) and mirroring them in the reasoning, thereby grounding statements, reducing hallucinations, and yielding modest accuracy gains. Dong & Fan (2025) goes further by prescribing step-level tags such as <rephrase> or <verify>, training models via supervised fine-tuning to emit tagged steps, and then applying GRPO with MAX-Flow and LCS rewards to encourage efficient step usage. While these methods clarify token roles or delineate intermediate steps to boost task accuracy or efficiency, they do not address the overall organization of reasoning. In contrast, ReFIne leverages tagging not only as markers but as means to restructure the reasoning process, producing traces that are more trustworthy in ways largely overlooked by prior works. Trustworthy LLMs. Recent efforts toward more trustworthy LLMs have largely focused on safety and interpretability. Safety-oriented work develops defenses against jailbreak attacks (Zou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2025a), such as randomized smoothing (Robey et al., 2023) and multi-agent filtering (Zeng et al., 2024). parallel line of works builds intrinsically interpretable models (Yang et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025b; Berthon & van der Schaar, 2025) by enforcing monosemantic experts or routing predictions through human-interpretable bottlenecks. While this line of works are valuable, they mainly target instructed LLMs and do not explicitly consider what properties make long-form reasoning itself trustworthy. Another related recent line of work (Damani et al., 2025) proposes to quantify model uncertainty during reasoning; while interesting, their work focuses primarily on the calibrated confidence for short reasoning tasks (up to 4k tokens, e.g., MATH-500) without investigating methods to improve interpretability or faithfulness of the LRMs. In contrast, ReFIne defines and enforces the desiderata for trustworthy reasoning in LRMs more broadly. For the reliability aspect, ReFIne also produces confidence score similar to Damani et al. (2025), but on 10-point scale rather than fine-grained decimal 0 1. We adopt this coarser scale as it is intuitively easier for humans to interpret. Beyond reliability, ReFIne also enforces interpretability, with clear and human-friendly structure, and faithfulness, accurately reflecting In terms of evaluations, we evaluate our LRMs on the models actual problem-solving process."

We see ReFIne as step toward establishing new standard for systematically improving and evaluating the trustworthiness of LRMs."
