            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "High-quality 3D garment models are critical assets for large variety of applications, ranging from entertainment to professional concerns, such as visual effects, physical simulation, and VR/AR telepresence. In the production-level pipeline, independent garment pieces are more desirable than single clothed human model, as the former allows layered compositions with an internal body mesh to ensure the realism of physical motion and the flexibility of garment transfer. However, unlike clothed human reconstruction that can directly utilize the latest advances of neural implicit representation [Saito et al. 2019, 2020; Xiu et al. 2022], standalone garment modeling mostly relies on deforming parametric templates with open boundaries due to its strict requirement of correct topology. Nonetheless, reconstructing high-fidelity 3D garment from single image remains nuisance to current vision algorithms. While the high diversity of garment styles and the scarcity of the inputs render the problem highly ill-posed, the complex deformations resulted from the cloth dynamics make the inference even more challenging. There are two mainstream approaches for estimating the deformations of standalone garments from posed humans. Linear blend skinning (LBS)-based methods [Corona et al. 2021; Jiang et al. 2020] focus on predicting the deformations caused by human poses, where the learned skinning weights of the garment mesh are either bound to the skeleton or the surface vertices of parametric model of unclothed humans (e.g., SMPL [Loper et al. 2015]). While this line of approaches can effectively represent posed-induced deformations, they struggle to model other intricate deformations caused by the environments or physical dynamics. Feature-line-based methods [Zhu et al. 2020, 2022] reconstruct garment meshes from SMPL surfaces ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 43, No. 6, Article . Publication date: December 2024. and further fit them with garments manifold boundaries, making it versatile to model any type of deformations. However, the problem of boundary estimation from single images itself is challenging, due to the severe occlusions and 2D-to-3D ambiguities. Apart from the technical challenges, the other obstacle to learningbased garment reconstruction is the limited quantity and quality of 3D dataset. Due to the lack of local geometry details in existing garment datasets, current LBS-based methods are incapable of learning fine-grained geometries (e.g., wrinkles), resulting in coarse 3D garment quality. ReEF [Zhu et al. 2022] annotates the feature lines for only 400 garment models in the RenderPeople dataset [RenderPeople 2018]. The limited data scale hampers the prior approaches from generalizing to unseen images and often leads to poor reconstruction quality of feature lines (i.e., garment boundaries). In this work, we strive to address the above issues for standalone 3D garment reconstruction from the perspectives of both data and algorithm. We thereby introduce GarVerseLOD, dedicated dataset and framework that achieves unprecedented robustness in reconstructing high-fidelity 3D garments from single in-the-wild image  (Fig. 1)  . To promote the quantity and quality of 3D garment data, GarVerseLOD collects 6,000 high-quality hand-crafted garment meshes with fine-grained details created by professional artists. It covers 5 most commonly seen categories each category shares the same mesh topology, facilitating cross-instance interpolation and construction of blendshape models. While garment shapes differ globally in terms of style and topology, the local deformations are determined by wide range of factors, including body poses, garment-environment interactions, self-collisions, etc. We, therefore, propose to craft GarVerseLOD as hierarchical dataset with levels of details (LOD) to accommodate this key observation. In particular, as shown in Fig. 2, GarVerseLOD contains three basic levels of databases: 1) Garment Style Database with T-posed and detail-free coarse garment; 2) Local Detail Database enclosing pairs of T-posed models with and without fine-level local geometric details; and 3) Garment Deformation Database consisting of pairs of T-posed garment and its deformed counterpart (i.e., with global deformations). As the mesh topologies are identical within each category, we can easily extract the local details and global deformations from paired models in the corresponding database and combine all levels of geometries to obtain the Fine Garment Dataset. The disentangled granularities of geometry allows us to make this highly underconstrained problem tractable by factorizing the inference into smaller tasks, each can be tackled with narrowed solution space. Furthermore, we introduce novel data labeling paradigm to generate extensive paired images for each garment model. Specifically, we leverage the latest advances in conditional diffusion model to transfer the textureless renderings to photorealistic images with diverse appearances. This further elevates the generalization capability of GarVerseLOD in handling unconstrained images. Algorithm-wise, we propose to connect the good ends of both LBS and feature-line based approaches. We first build parametric model of the T-posed coarse shapes in the garment style database. After estimating the blendshape coefficients of the coarse garment, we progressively refine the result by adding pose-induced global deformations and fine-scale local deformations. Thanks to the LOD structure of GarVerseLOD, these three steps can be performed in GarVerseLOD: High-Fidelity 3D Garment Reconstruction from Single In-the-Wild Image using Dataset with Levels of Details 3 disentangled manner with eased complexity. While we employ linear blend skinning to estimate deformations caused by body poses, an implicit garment representation is learned to capture pixel-aligned fine surface from estimated 2D normal maps. We then fit the posed coarse garment with fine surfaces by aligning their open boundaries for the purpose of transferring the local details to the globally deformed mesh with correct topology. To combat with the occlusions, we present novel geometry-aware boundary prediction strategy that equips the 2D features with 3D information from the estimated fine surface for better localization of 3D boundaries. Our experimental results show that GarVerseLOD can effectively reconstruct garments with diversified shapes and intricate deformations, demonstrating significantly better generalization ability over the prior arts. We summarize our contributions as follows: We present the GarVerseLOD dataset, large collection of high-fidelity 3D hand-crafted garments. It encloses 6,000 professionally hand-crafted garments, covers 5 categories, and, for the first time, contains 3 disentangled levels of details to ease the learning task. We propose novel data simulation pipeline to generate extensive paired images for supporting single-view reconstruction. We devise specially-tailored coarse-to-fine approach to fully utilize the LOD structure of the GarVerseLOD dataset. Experimental results show that our method excels in reconstructing high-quality garments from single images."

            "content": "3D Human Reconstruction. 3D reconstruction has seen significant advancements recently [Habermann et al. 2019, 2020; Jiang et al. 2022; Li et al. 2021; Loper et al. 2015; Luo et al. 2023, 2021; Poole et al. 2022; Saito et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2018; Yan et al. 2024]. Some single-view human reconstruction methods [Anguelov et al. 2005; Hasler et al. 2009; Lassner et al. 2017; Pavlakos et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2019] restrict the solution space to parametric human model and simplify the problem, which can only reconstruct nude human 3D models without garments. Inspired by SMPL [Loper et al. 2015], some methods [Alldieck et al. 2019; Tan et al. 2020; Xiang et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2019] approximate human body geometry by deforming the SMPL. These methods can reconstruct realistic results from an unconstrained image but fail to handle loose garments. Contrary to the SMPL-based approaches, other methods enable clothed human body reconstruction with arbitrary topology. Siclope [Natsume et al. 2019] reconstructs clothed 3D human models using multi-view silhouettes predicted from frontal image. DeepHuman [Zheng et al. 2019] generates progressively refined voxels, which are embossed with details from surface normal. While both methods can produce clothed human shapes with arbitrary topology, the details are relatively coarse. Recent works [Li et al. 2020; Saito et al. 2019, 2020; Xiu et al. 2023, 2022] address this issue with pixel-aligned implicit functions and achieve high reconstruction fidelity. However, all the above methods fail to provide the garment mesh separated from the human body. 3D Garment Reconstruction. Compared to clothed 3D human bodies, reconstructing high-fidelity 3D independent garments from single image is challenging. Many prior arts rely on learning-based strategies to fit 3D garment deformations from collection of 2D image-3D garment pairs for generalization. Two mainstream approaches are often used in estimating standalone garments from single images. Linear blend skinning (LBS)-based methods (e.g., BCNet [Jiang et al. 2020], ClothWild [Moon et al. 2022]) focus on predicting deformations caused by human poses, where explicit or implicit garment parametric models are used. These methods can address posed-guided deformations but fail to reproduce large cloth deformations (e.g., those caused by complex environmental factors) and fine-grained surface details (e.g., wrinkles). Recent works, such as ISP [Li et al. 2024b] and Neural-ABC [Chen et al. 2024], have proposed more advanced implicit parametric models, but their reconstruction methods still rely solely on their parametric models. Similar to BCNet [Jiang et al. 2020] and ClothWild [Moon et al. 2022], the limited representational capacity of the parametric models prevents them from accurately recovering complex garment deformations from images. Feature-line-based methods [Zhu et al. 2020, 2022] reconstruct garment meshes from SMPL and further fit them with the estimated pixel-aligned clothed human and the predicted garments manifold boundaries, making them flexible to model cloth deformations and geometric details. However, the problem of boundary estimation from single images itself is challenging, due to the severe occlusions and 2D-to-3D ambiguities. Garment Recovery [Li et al. 2024a] relies on normal estimator trained on human data with limited clothing diversity and deformation prior trained with limited deformation variations, preventing it from accurately reconstructing high-fidelity surface details and complex deformations that reflect the inputs. All existing methods cannot faithfully recover intricate clothing deformations and fine-grained geometric details from single-view images. 3D Garment Datasets. 3D garment datasets are an important foundation for learning-based tasks, but current available datasets are very limited in quality and scale. Existing datasets can be divided into two major categories: scanning-based datasets [Bhatnagar et al. 2019; Lin et al. 2023; Pons-Moll et al. 2017; Tiwari et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2020] and simulation-based datasets [Bertiche et al. 2020; Black et al. 2023; Gundogdu et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2020; Patel et al. 2020; Zou et al. 2023]. Scanning-based datasets allow for realistic garment appearance and shape. However, separating garment models from 3D scans is laborious and often results in surface damage due to occlusion. These datasets usually are restricted by data scale and suffer from the inability to separate garments from the mannequin [Zhang et al. 2017], as well as insufficient clothing diversity. Simulation-based datasets synthesize 3D garments by simulating motion using physics-based engines. However, these synthetic datasets are unsatisfactory in terms of cloth style, body pose and garment deformation variations, as well as the quality of paired images. It is difficult to generalize the trained models to in-the-wild images. We introduce large-scale 3D garment dataset characterized by intricate deformations and fine-grained surface details. Additionally, we present novel data simulation strategy to collect extensive image-3D garment pairs by leveraging the generative capabilities of conditional stable diffusion models [Mou et al. 2023; Rombach et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2023a].

            "content": "Reconstructing accurate and standalone garments from single images remains significant challenge due to the absence of wellestablished dataset, especially for scenarios involving complex deformations like human-garment or garment-environment interactions. Existing datasets suffer from limited data scale [Bhatnagar et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2020], or lack of paired 2D image-3D garment data [Bertiche et al. 2020], or solely monotonous rendered images paired with clothing models [Zou et al. 2023]. In this work, we fill this gap by introducing GarVerseLOD, progressive dataset with levels of details (LOD). Additionally, we present novel data generation pipeline to construct large-scale dataset with realistic images paired with 3D models in GarVerseLOD. Overview. GarVerseLOD has four features: 1) Broad diversity. GarVerseLOD contains 5 common garment categories, i.e. dress, skirt, coat, top, and pant. Each 3D model comprises fine-grained geometric details and intricate clothing physical deformations. 2) Levels of details. We collect three basic databases with different levels of details (LOD) to obtain high-quality 3D clothes. Based on these databases, we create large number of posed 3D garments with complex deformations and fine-grained geometric details. 3) Topological consistency. Each 3D garment in GarVerseLOD is created by carefully deforming pre-defined template mesh. All 3D garments within different categories share unified topology, paving the way to learn parametric model. 4) Extensive paired data. To create high-quality image-3D garment paired data, we employ ControlNet [Zhang et al. 2023a] and T2I-Adapter [Mou et al. ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 43, No. 6, Article .

In Fig. 2(a), we collected set of reference images of clothed humans with diverse garment styles from the Internet and hired eight artists to craft T-posed coarse garment for each reference image (without surface geometric details like wrinkles, only depicting the overall cloth shape); 2) Local Detail Database. In Fig. 2(b), we collected set of reference images of clothes with diverse surface details (e.g., wrinkles). The eight artists were asked to carve two T-posed garments for each image: one without surface details (𝐿𝐶 ) and one with fine surface details (𝐿𝐹 ). These garment pairs (𝐿𝐶 , 𝐿𝐹 ) describe garment local geometric details; 3) Garment Deformation Database. In Fig. 2(c), we collected set of reference images of clothed humans with diverse poses and garment deformations. For each image, we use PyMAF [Zhang et al. 2021] to estimate the SMPL shape 𝛽 and pose 𝜃 from the images. The artists were asked to construct two over-smoothed garments (i.e., garments without local geometric details): T-posed garment (i.e, 𝐷𝑇 on top of the estimated T-pose body) and garment with global deformation aligned with the image (i.e., 𝐷𝐹 , on top of the posed body).

All models in the above three databases are created by deforming predefined templates (i.e., dress, skirt, coat, top, and pant). Thus, all 3D garments within different categories are homeomorphic in topology. The feature of topologicalconsistency not only paves the way to learning parametric model (Sec. 4.1), but also enables the incorporation of our three basic databases to obtain the fine garment dataset. As shown in Fig. 2, we first sample coarse garment shape 𝑀𝐶 by interpolating between garments in the Garment Style Database. Then we sample Local Detail Pair (𝐿𝐶 , 𝐿𝐹 ) and apply their vertex offsets to 𝑀𝐶 by, 𝑀𝐿 = 𝑀𝐶 + 𝐿𝐹 𝐿𝐶, (1) where 𝑀𝐿 denotes the T-posed garment with local details transferred from 𝐿𝐹 .

Inspired by ReEF [Zhu et al. 2022], we adopt cylinder structure to represent the garment boundary. To obtain garment boundaries, straightforward approach is to use 2D image cues to regress the boundary cylinders. However, relying solely on 2D pixel-aligned features suffers from depth ambiguity, leading to inconsistent 3D results. To address the ambiguity, we integrate 2D clues and 3D geometry-aligned features to enhance global boundary shape alignment (see Fig. 4). We utilize the previous pixel-aligned image feature 𝐹 (𝜋 (𝑝)) as 2D clues. To produce geometry-aware features from the fine garment 𝑀𝐼 , we employ triplane encoder 𝜓𝑒𝑛𝑐 to obtain 3D features aligned with three axis-aligned orthogonal planes. Specifically, point clouds sampled from 𝑀𝐼 are projected onto the triplane, and 3D-aware UNet 𝜓𝑒𝑛𝑐 is used to obtain high-level triplane feature maps [Liu et al. 2024]. Then we query any 3D position 𝑝 R3 by projecting it onto each feature plane, retrieving three corresponding feature vectors 𝐺𝐹 (𝑝) = (𝐹𝑥 𝑦, 𝐹𝑥𝑧, 𝐹𝑦𝑧) via bilinear interpolation. small MLPbased decoder 𝜓𝑑𝑒𝑐 is used to interpret the aggregated concatenated 2D pixel-aligned and 3D triplane features as 3D boundary fields.

To evaluate reconstruction quality, we employ commonly used metrics [Mescheder et al. 2019] for quantitative comparisons, including Chamfer Distance, Normal Consistency, and Intersection over Union (IoU). Quantitative comparisons were conducted on the test-set of our synthetic data, while qualitative comparisons were performed on in-the-wild images. Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 present our representative results. Please refer to our supplementary materials for more results and implementation details. Comparison Study. We compare our method with the state-ofthe-art single-view garment reconstruction methods, i.e., BCNet, ClothWild, DeepFashion3D and ReEF, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Tab. 1 shows the quantitative comparisons. Our proposed method achieves the best scores against the baselines. Fig. 6 provides qualitative comparisons given the input of in-the-wild images. LBS-based methods (e.g., BCNet, ClothWild) only capture coarse deformations caused by pose and often neglect surface details.

Ablation Study on MLP-based network to regress larger number of vertex offsets. Using only global features makes it inefficient for DeepFashion3D to obtain accurate boundaries, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. Although ReEF performs well on simple poses and simple clothing deformations by leveraging pixel-aligned features, it presents artifacts on garments with complex human poses and garment deformations. Our method demonstrates proficiency in capturing both large garment deformations and geometric details. Ablation Study on Boundary Prediction. Tab. 2 shows the quantitative comparisons between ReEF and our method on boundary field prediction. Our proposed method achieves better scores. Fig. 7 provides qualitative comparisons on garment boundary reconstruction. As noted, relying solely on 2D pixel-aligned features makes ReEF fail to predict accurate boundaries with complex poses and deformations, resulting in discontinuous boundaries. Our geometryaware boundary prediction excels in reconstructing complex garment boundaries that are well-aligned with the garment shape. Ablation Study on Data. We verify the significance of our data by training our method on both: 1) ReEFs dataset; and 2) our GarVerseLOD. As shown in Fig. 8 and Tab. 3, the model trained with our data achieves the best results, indicating that our data enhances the networks generalization in reconstructing in-the-wild images. Ablation Study on Coarse Garment Estimation. To demonstrate the significance of using our dataset in building the garment parametric model, we conduct an ablation study on different methods to obtain coarse garments. Apart from using our parametric model and estimator, there is an alternative strategy: cropping part of the mesh from posed SMPL body, as used in DeepFashion3D and ReEF. Fig. 9 and Tab. 3 present the comparisons between our method and the ablated strategies. Our method is superior in estimating more reasonable coarse garment. The registered results show that good coarse initialization significantly stabilizes the registration process. Ablation Study on Implicit Representation. Apart from registering coarse garments to fine garments, another strategy for obtaining open-boundary meshes is to use UDF (Unsigned Distance Field). However, UDF encounters two problems (Fig. 10, Tab. 3): 1) Although some methods [Guillard et al. 2022] can extract open-boundary meshes from UDF, the quality is poor and may result in unexpected open regions and incomplete meshes. Garment registration is still required to achieve fine topology. 2) The regression problem with UDF is more challenging to converge than classification, resulting in inferior surface details compared to the occupancy field."

Publication date: December 2024. garment complexity and data scarcity. Our work presents largescale 3D garment dataset GarVerseLOD, which is extensively annotated at different levels of detail, ranging from coarse stylized garments to deformed models with intricate deformations and finegrained geometric details. Based on the well-established dataset, we propose framework for high-quality 3D garment reconstruction from single-view images. The core of our approach is hierarchical design to recover different levels of garment details, i.e., from pose-independent stylized coarse garments to pose-blended and open-boundary garments with pixel-aligned details. Experiments indicate that our framework is capable of reconstructing garments with various shapes and fine-grained deformations, showcasing its superior generalization ability against state-of-the-art methods. Limitation. Although our work provides faithful reconstructed results on wide range of in-the-wild images, it may fail when reconstructing garments with complex topology: 1) As shown in Fig. 11(a), although our method is able to reconstruct faithful clothing details, it fails to represent the multi-layer structures present in dresses or skirts. This problem is largely due to the reliance on the single-layer occupancy field and the single-layer garment parametric model, which are unable to capture multi-layered structures. One possible solution is to design new representation that effectively supports the reconstruction of garments with multi-layer structures; 2) As shown in Fig. 11(b), our method struggles to accurately reconstruct dresses or skirts with slits. This issue primarily stems from the limited representation of such features in our current dataset. The lack of sufficient examples of slits in the training data restricts the models ability to generalize and accurately reconstruct these specific structures. potential strategy is to expand the dataset by incorporating broader range of clothing styless, thereby enhancing the models capability to handle these intricate features."

            "title": "A MORE RESULTS AND IMPLEMENTATION",
            "content": "More Results. We report more results on challenging loose cloth reconstruction in Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16 and Fig. 17. Implementation details. In our implementation, all networks were implemented using PyTorch and trained on an Ubuntu server equipped with four A100 GPUs. Quantitative evaluations and qualitative assessments were also performed on this server. For the coarse garment estimator, the parameter size of our statistical garment model 𝐺 (𝛼) is 32 (i.e., the length of 𝛼 is 32). We use ResNet-50 blocks [Luo et al. 2023; Marcel and Rodriguez 2010] to map the input image (512 512 3) to 𝛼 and obtain the T-posed coarse garment through Eq. 4 in the Main Paper. All the data in the Garment Style Database were used to learn 𝐺 (𝛼). To obtain powerful estimator, we collected 10,000 image-3D T-pose garment paired data (as shown in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(f) of the Main Paper) for training. The coarse garment estimator is trained for 1000 epochs using the Adam optimizer with batch size of 128 and learning rate of 3 104. For the SMPL body estimator, we employ the well-established body estimator PyMAF [Zhang et al. 2023b, 2021] to predict body shape and pose. Inspired by the normal-aided approaches [Saito et al. 2020; Xiu et al. 2022], we employ the normal map and garment segmentation mask as inputs to accurately carve the garment surface details. In the training stage, the ground-truth normal maps and garment masks of our synthetic data are directly rendered from the 3D garment models of GarVerseLOD. Given the ground-truth normal map (512 512 3) and the corresponding collected images (512 512 3), we train normal estimator using U-Net [Ronneberger et al. 2015] network with the following loss: 𝐿𝑁 = 𝐿𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙 [𝑀] + 𝜆𝑉 𝐺𝐺 𝐿𝑉 𝐺𝐺 [𝑀], (17) where 𝐿𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙 is 𝐿1 Loss between the ground-truth and predicted normal maps and 𝐿𝑉 𝐺𝐺 is perceptual loss [Johnson et al. 2016] weighted by 𝜆𝑉 𝐺𝐺 . is the pixel-aligned mask as shown in Fig. 3(c) of the Main Paper. We collect 5,000 paired data (as illustrated in Fig. 3(b,c,d) of the Main Paper to train the normal estimator. To improve the performance of the normal estimator, we also incorporate data from THUman2 [Yu et al. 2021]. The normal estimator is trained for 80 epochs using the Adam optimizer with batch size of 32 and learning rate of 3 104. In the testing stage, the garment masks of in-the-wild images are generated by leveraging the segmentation of SAM [Kirillov et al. 2023], and the normal maps are predicted by our trained estimator. For the fine garment estimator and the geometry-aware boundary predictor, the input size of the normal map and the garment mask is 512 512 3. Inspired by [Saito et al. 2019], we utilize an Hourglass filter to extract image features and employ an MLP network to decode the features of each sampled point into an occupancy value. The fine garment estimator undergoes 100 epochs of training with the RMSprop optimizer, utilizing batch size of 16 and start-up learning rate of 1 103. The learning rate is reduced by factor of 10 after epochs 30, 60, and 90. The geometry-aware triplane features are set to resolution of 256256. The boundary estimator is trained over 100 epochs using the RMSprop optimizer, with batch size of 12 and starting learning rate of 1 103. The learning rate is also reduced by factor of 10 following epochs 30, 60, and 90. We construct 5,000 pairs of data for each category using the data synthesis strategy shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 of the Main Paper to train our fine garment estimator and the geometry-aware boundary predictor. Although our experiments were conducted with 5,000 pairs of data, it is important to note that our strategy is capable of synthesizing larger-scale datasets, given sufficient computing resources. For garment shape registration, it is generally better to use different weight schedulers to optimize various types of clothing. Please refer to our code for details."

            "content": "GarVerseLOD spans wide range of 3D garment models, containing 5 common garment categories, i.e., dress, skirt, coat, top, and pant. Tab. 4 shows the statistical data for each garment category. The total size represents the number of garments created by artists, not the size of garments our strategy can synthesize. We have recruited eight professional artists to create corresponding 3D garments using Blender based on the collected reference images. The topological consistency of garments enables us to generate new samples by interpolating between two garments within each database. Theoretically, we can generate more garments than the product of the sizes of the individual databases. All eight artists are required to craft 3D models by deforming the predefined template mesh. Each artist possesses over five years of modeling experience, and on average, each garment takes around average 25 minutes to complete. Fig. 12 illustrates the predefined template meshes for each category. Fig. 18, Fig. 19, Fig. 20 and Fig. 21 respectively illustrate our four datasets: 1) Garment Style Database; 2) Local Detail Database; 3) Garment Deformation Database and 4) Fine Garment Dataset.

Garment Deformation Crafting. As shown in Fig. 13, we first collect real images of clothed humans with diverse poses, garment styles, and deformations from the Internet, covering the 5 garment ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 43, No. 6, Article . Publication date: December 2024. 14 Zhongjin Luo, Haolin Liu, Chenghong Li, Wanghao Du, Zirong Jin, Wanhu Sun, Yinyu Nie, Weikai Chen, and Xiaoguang Han Fig. 13. Given Collected Image, we utilize PyMAF [Zhang et al. 2023b, 2021] to estimate SMPL body. Eight artists are then tasked with creating T-pose Garment shapes by deforming predefined Template to match the T-pose body predicted by PyMAF. Then the SMPLs Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) is extended to the T-pose garment to obtain the Posed Garment. Finally, the artists are further instructed to refine the posed garment to get the Crafted Garment while ensuring that garment deformations closely match the collected images. Posed Garment represent the shape of clothing influenced by human pose, while Crafted Garment capture the state of garments affected by various complex factorsnot only pose but also other environmental influences, such as garment-environment interactions and external forces like wind. categories. Secondly, we employ PyMAF [Zhang et al. 2021] to estimate the human shape 𝛽 and pose 𝜃 from the images and discard the inaccurate estimation results manually. Thirdly, we recruited 8 artists to construct 3D clothing models manually to match the reference images as much as possible, following the specific procedure below: 1) The artists are required to create the coarse T-pose Garments according to the Collected Images, by deforming the predefined category-specific templates to match T-pose SMPL meshes generated by PyMAF; 2) Then, the SMPLs Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) is extended to the T-pose garments programmatically to capture garment deformations resulting from human poses, obtaining the Posed Garments; 3) Finally, the artists are asked to deform the Posed Garments to create the final Crafted Garments, ensuring that deformations match the collected images as closely as possible. In-the-wild images naturally capture the complex real-world physical conditions that occur in single snapshot. By basing manual modeling on reference images, our data encompass diverse clothingstates observed in real-world scenarios. Note that Posed Garments represent the shape of garments after being affected by human pose, while Deformed Garments (i.e, Crafted Garments) capture the state of garments affected by complex factors (not only affected by pose, but also by other complex environmental factors, such as garment-environment interactions and external forces like wind).
