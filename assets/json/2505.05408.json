            "content": "Scaling up compute at test-time can maximize model performance and output quality [1, 2, 3, 4], but it has been understudied in multilingual settings. In particular, reasoning language models (RLMs), such as Deepseeks r1 [5] and OpenAIs o1 or o3 models [6, 7], strongly benefit from added inference compute to their long chain-of-thoughts (long CoTs) [8]. However, this advantage has primarily been explored in English contexts, such as in recent work that combined small-scale reasoning finetuning with scaled up thinking tokens at test time [9, 10]. State-of-the-art RLMs rely on reasoning training data that contain long CoTs, which is currently most available for English [11]. Thus, these RLMs are English-centric [9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 11]. Given that their base models are often multilingual models such as Qwen models [16], does reasoning finetuning in English give them multilingual reasoning abilities? In this work, we investigate how much test-time compute can improve multilingual reasoning abilities of English-centric RLMs. In particular, our research questions are as follows: Core contributors. See Appendix for further details. Preprint. Under review. RQ1. Crosslingual test-time scaling: How effective is test-time scaling of English-centric RLMs on multilingual reasoning tasks? (Section 4) RQ2. Language-mixing behaviors: What kind of language-mixing patterns do English-centric RLMs exhibit when they interact with non-English prompts? (Section 5) RQ3. Language forcing: How well do English-centric RLMs perform when being forced to think in non-English languages? (Section 6) RQ4. Cross-domain generalization: How well does crosslingual reasoning generalize beyond the original STEM domain, such as humanities and social sciences? (Section 7) We experiment with s1 models [9] as our English-centric RLMs for crosslingual generalization study. They are multilingual Qwen2.5-Instruct models [16] supervised finetuned on 1k training samples of English STEM reasoning tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on English math reasoning benchmarks [9]. Our most significant contributions are as follows: 2 1. We provide evidence that larger models benefit from crosslingual test-time scaling, which contrasts with contemporary work [17] that reports early negative findings based on 1.5B models. Crosslingual test-time scaling is not only effective for both high-resource and low-resource languages, but it also allows an RLM to outperform models twice its size on multilingual math reasoning tasks. 2. We report dominant language-mixing pattern where RLMs quote non-English phrases related to the question prompts in quotation marks in the thinking process. This quote-and-think pattern suggests that models multilingual capability to parse and understand questions enables crosslingual generalization of English reasoning finetuning. 3. We discover an effective strategy to control the reasoning language of RLMs, and we find that forcing RLMs to think in high-resource languages yields substantially better reasoning performance than in low-resource languages. Furthermore, the long CoTs for high-resource languages are more token-efficient at test time. 4. We show that while reasoning finetuning may benefit tasks in certain domains, we do not observe consistent benefits of scaling up thinking tokens for non-STEM tasks that are outside of the STEM domain of reasoning finetuning data. In domains requiring cultural commonsense knowledge, test-time scaling can even hurt performance. Our work shows that test-time scaling of English-centric RLMs can serve as strong multilingual reasoning baseline. Furthermore, for English-centric reasoning finetuning, it is advisable to finetune models through data-efficient training (such as with s1s data [9]) to minimize catastrophic forgetting of multilingual capability. We recommend letting the English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese for optimal performance and inference-compute efficiency. Future work is needed for enabling RLMs to generalize to out-of-domain tasks or to reason in low-resource languages."

            "content": "Reasoning language models (RLMs) Recent advancements of reasoning language models (RLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 [6, 7] and DeepSeek-R1 [5] builds on LLMs capability to perform intermediate reasoning steps, which is commonly referred to as chain-of-thought reasoning [18]. Prior work demonstrates that these intermediate computation steps can significantly improve the correctness for final answer outputs [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Furthermore, extending the lengths of these computation steps, thereby creating long chain-of-thoughts (long CoTs), can allow the model to backtrack on incorrect reasoning steps and self-correct its final answer [8, 23, 5, 12, 24]. In our work, we focus on RLMs with long CoTs capability, which is an emerging research area. These models are created through distilling long English-only reasoning chains from larger RLMs [25, 10, 26, 27, 28] to finetune multilingual pretrained models like Llama [29] or Qwen models [16]. There is limited understanding how pretrained models multilingual capability enables crosslingual reasoning of long CoTs, which our work aims to address. 2We release our code and artifacts at https://github.com/BatsResearch/crosslingual-testtime-scaling. 2 Test-time scaling and s1 Test-time scaling is new scaling paradigm where more computation budget is allocated for LLMs at inference time before committing to an answer [1]. One example of test-time scaling is scaling up model generation length, particularly for RLMs with long CoTs capability [1, 30, 6, 5]. In particular, the s1 work [9] demonstrates the effectiveness of simple test-time scaling recipe: reasoning finetuning on small amount of training data with long CoTs (specifically 1k samples distilled from larger RLMs such as DeepSeek-R1) and scaling up inference budget at test time. Through test-time scaling of 32B-parameter model, the authors achieve the state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance, and their models even rival industry-grade RLMs such as o1-mini [6]. Nonetheless, similar to aforementioned RLMs literature, exploration of test-time scaling paradigm mostly evaluate on English math benchmarks [1, 11, 4, 15, 3, 9]. Here, our work focuses on understanding how effective test-time scaling of English-centric RLMs, specifically s1 models, in multilingual settings for various domains. Multilingual reasoning Multilingual reasoning encompasses the ability of language models to perform complex reasoning tasks across different languages. Early work has demonstrated that chainof-thought prompting in English can significantly improve performance on multilingual mathematical reasoning tasks [31], which suggests that LLMs might rely on dominant languages like English as pivot language for complex reasoning. Follow-up work explores several strategies such as translating the multilingual queries to English [32, 33, 34], aligning of latent representation spaces [35, 36] and reasoning outputs [37, 38] across languages, or expanding language coverage of reasoning training data [39]. Our work focuses on understanding how controlling the length of long CoTs and their reasoning language at test time affects multilingual reasoning. One similar work [17] experimented with controlling generation lengths of finetuned DeepSeek-R1-1.5B [5] but reported negative results: increasing thinking tokens leads to minimal performance gains for mathematical reasoning in nonEnglish languages. We believe that their negative findings are due to constrained model parameters, as we show that larger models can benefit from crosslingual test-time scaling."

            "title": "3 Experimental Setup",
            "content": "Models We use s1 models [9] as our English-centric RLMs. In particular, we work with the s1.1 variants, which are multilingual Qwen2.5-Instruct models finetuned on 1k English-only reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1. We choose s1 models for two reasons: (1) their English mathematical reasoning capability reaches state-of-the-art performance, and (2) the models and the training data are fully open-sourced. We experiment with s1 models at different scalesspecifically with 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, and 32B parameters. Budget forcing Budget forcing refers to techniques for controlling inference budget for long CoTs [9], which can be done in two ways: (1) truncation, which cuts off long CoTs after they reach maximum thinking tokens, or (2) extrapolation, which adds tokens such as Wait at the end of CoTs to force the model continue reasoning. In our extrapolation setup, we experiment with adding Wait only once since we do not observe significant performance gains from lengthening CoTs. Evaluation data For research questions RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3, we use the Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM) benchmark [31]. It contains 250 grade-school math problems from the GSM8K dataset that have been manually translated into ten languagesBengali (bn), German (de), Spanish (es), French (fr), Japanese (ja), Russian (ru), Swahili (sw), Telugu (te), Thai (th), and Mandarin Chinese (zh). We check for 8-gram overlap between s1s training samples and MGSM (including the English subset) following standard practice [40], and we observe no traintest overlap. For RQ4, addressed in section 7, we evaluate on three different cross-domain benchmarks: 1. Global-MMLU [41]: multilingual translated version of the original MMLU dataset [42] that spans different subject topics, including STEM, business, humanities, medical, social sciences, etc. Additionally, it also contains annotations that identify whether the question is culturally agnostic or specific, allowing for more fine-grained analysis. 2. Food ORiented cultural commonsense Knowledge (FORK) [43]: manually-curated set of commonsenseQA-style [44] questions in English for probing cultural biases and assumptions on food-related customs around the world. 3 Figure 1: Crosslingual test-time scaling of s1 and Qwen models on the MGSM benchmark (excluding English) across different model sizes. In subfigure (a) we enforce hard limit of maximum thinking token, and in (b) we measure their inference FLOP compute for Pareto frontier analysis. measures the absolute difference between average accuracy scores at 0.5k and 8k maximum thinking tokens. Dash lines indicate the best few-shot prompting baseline performance of Qwen. 3. COPAL-ID [45]: manually-curated datasets following COPAs causal reasoning format [46] in Indonesian languages to evaluate causal reasoning with Indonesian cultural nuances. We use the lm-evaluation-harness library [47] as the main evaluation framework.3. We evaluate with greedy decoding and report task accuracy, which is equivalent to pass@1. Baselines Qwen2.5-Instruct models, which are the base models of s1, are our main baseline models. For MGSM, we apply two prompting strategies. The first is zero-shot prompting, and the second is few-shot CoT prompting using the provided eight CoT examples in MGSM train set. For the latter, we follow [31] and experiment with prompting with few-shot CoT in English (EN-CoT) and in the same language as input prompt (native-CoT). In addition, for MGSM, we benchmark against prior state-of-the-art models [48, 37, 49, 35, 50] and comparable English-centric RLMs such as R1-distilled-Qwen models [5] open-sourced by DeepSeek. For cross-domain benchmarks, we simply compare against zero-shot prompting of Qwen2.5-Instruct."

These models were finetuned from multilingual pretrained models in the same domain, therefore carrying high potential for crosslingual transfer. 4.1 Effectiveness of Crosslingual Test-Time Scaling Crosslingual generalization of reasoning training and test-time scaling We report two main obsevations from Figure 1 (a). First, we observe that s1 outperforms Qwens few-shot prompting baseline across languages in MGSM (excluding English) when given high inference thinking budget. Second, crosslingual test-time scaling is effective for models with 3B parameters and above, with s1 at 14B size having the largest accuracy gain of +9.4% when maximum inference budget increases from 0.5k to 8k thinking tokens. We want to highlight that sufficient model capacity is necessary for effective crosslingual test-time scaling, as test-time scaling only yields minimal benefits at 1.5B 3For cross-domain benchmarks, we use the configuration generate_until tasks instead of the default multiple_choices setting for cross-domain benchmarks and extract answers from generations using GPT4o-mini (see Appendix E.1).

The model only experiences +1.8% accuracy gain with performance peak at 4000 maximum thinking tokens. Our findings contrast the conclusion drawn by recent work [17] that test-time scaling may not generalize as effectively to multilingual tasks. Our results suggest that the limitation observed by [17] is due to their usage of 1.5B models in their experiments, instead of an inherent weakness of testtime scaling. Furthermore, [17] posit that multilingual generalization of test-time scaling would occur for significantly larger models with at least 70B parameters, but we discover substantially smaller parameter threshold at 3B parameters, above which models consistently benefit from crosslingual test-time scaling. Pareto frontier analysis Figure 1 (b) illustrates the performance-efficiency trade-off across different sizes of the s1 model family on MGSM. We follow prior test-time scaling work [1, 51] and compute the inference cost using the approximation FLOPs = 2N Dinference where represents model parameters and Dinference the total number of tokens generated at inference time, and we average across different languages. The figure further demonstrates the model capacity constraint on test-time scaling: The 32B and 14B models can reach accuracy levels that are simply unattainable for the smaller models, no matter how much test-time compute is allocated to those smaller models. Even at their maximum performance ceiling, the 3B and 7B models cannot match what the larger models achieve with moderate computational resources. While we observe accuracy-to-computation tradeoffs (i.e., better performance comes with using larger models and higher test-time compute), the 14B model offers compelling compromise by achieving above 80% accuracy with substantially lower inference FLOPs than the 32B model, representing \"sweet spot\" on the Pareto frontier for practical applications. 4.2 Performance Comparison on MGSM Benchmark Comparison against Qwen baselines. Table 1 shows that with cross-lingual test-time scaling, s1 gains substantial accuracy increase as compared to different baselines with Qwen2.5 models. Furthermore, crosslingual test-time scaling benefits both high-resource and low-resource languages. For instance, fr receives significant +23.1% relative accuracy increase, whereas swthe worstperforming language for the base model Qwenreceives +41.6% relative accuracy improvement. Lastly, we observe similar performance for both truncation and extrapolation budget forcing strategies. This is because s1 models are already generating extensive reasoning chains so further lengthening the CoTs have minimal benefits. Similar trends of language-specific improvements are also observed in other s1 model sizes (Appendix B). 5 Box 1. Example of quote-and-think language-mixing pattern demonstrated by s1 where non-English phrases are mentioned in quotation marks and used for reasoning. Question: ローブを作成するには青色の繊維を2巻分白色の繊維をその半分用 いる必要があります全体で何巻必要ですか (To make robe, you need 2 rolls of blue fiber and half of the white fiber. How many rolls are needed total?) s1s Thinking: Okay, lets see. ... The problem says \"白色の繊維をその半分用いる\" which is white fibers the half amount. \"その\" refers to the blue fibers, right? So half of the blue fibers, which is 2 rolls, so half is 1. So 2 + 1 is 3. Yeah, that seems right. Wait, sometimes these problems can be tricks, but dont think so. If it had said \"白色の繊維 を2巻分とその半分\" that would be different, but no. Its \"青色の繊維を2巻分白色の 繊維をその半分\". So white is half of blue. So calculation is straightforward. Blue 2, white 1, total 3. ... Comparison against state-of-the-art models. Table 1 shows that crosslingual test-time scaling of s1 models can serve as strong multilingual baseline for MGSM, as it outperforms all prior state-of-the-art models that involve finetuning on multilingual data such as MetaMath, MAPO, and [52, 37, 49, 35]. We believe this is because these prior studies use Llama as their base models, which generate significantly shorter reasoning traces and lack sophisticated reasoning behaviors such as verification and backtracking compared to Qwen models [23]. Surprisingly, 14B-sized s1 can even outperform recent state-of-the-art reasoning models twice its size, namely DeepSeeks R1-Distill-Qwen-32B [5] and Googles Gemma-3-27B-it [50]. We observe that R1-Distill-Qwen has substantially poorer performance on sw and te, suggesting that their 800k samples of English and Chinese training data [5] leads to catastrophic forgetting of lower-resource languages. In contrast, s1 is only trained with 1k English samples for only 5 epochs [9], which leads to minimal forgetting and better crosslingual generalization. While the multilingual Gemma-3 models outperform s1 on low-resource languages, probably due to these languages being incorporated during reasoning finetuning, its performance gap against s1 on high-resource languages may be attributed to the shorter reasoning thinking time. Qwen3 [53] is the most performant model, probably due to its long reasoning capability and extensive multilingual training data."

            "title": "5 Language-Mixing Behaviors",
            "content": "We notice that s1 models can mix languages in their CoT reasoning under inference scaling. Given lack of systematic study of language mixing behaviors in crosslingual reasoning in prior work [5, 11], we present an analysis of linguistic behaviors of s1 in multilingual math reasoning tasks to address RQ2. In particular, we are interested in two sub-questions of RQ2. First, how does the dominant languagethe primary language of generated response, also known as matrix languagechange after English-centric reasoning finetuning? Second, what are the language-mixing patterns exhibited by s1 in its reasoning outputs? We focus on four languages, namely ja, ru, th, and zh, and we refer our readers to Appendix C.1 for detailed methodology. 5.1 Dominant Language in Model Outputs Figure 2 shows that s1 and its base model Qwen use entirely different dominant languages in their overall responses in multilingual settings. Qwen models generate responses in the same language as the questions, especially for zero-shot and native CoT prompting settings. Surprisingly, even in crosslingual input settings where the 8-shot CoT reasoning samples are provided in English, Qwen models still stick to generating outputs in the same language as the question. In contrast, s1 generates reasoning and final answers with English as the dominant language, which suggests that finetuning on only 1k English reasoning data can sufficiently change model behavior from multilingual to English-dominant. Similar behaviors are observed for models at smaller parameter sizes (Figure 8). 6 Figure 2: Proportion of dominant languages in models entire responses when queried with multilingual math questions. same indicates that the response language is the same as query language. Figure 3: Breakdown of language-mixing patterns in s1s reasoning. Percentage indicates the probability of sentence being English only, quoting non-English phrases (quote-and-think), entirely being in different language (intersentential), or mixing different languages within the same sentence (intrasentential). 5.2 Language-Mixing Patterns During Reasoning Dominant mixing pattern Figure 3 shows that s1s reasoning is predominantly in English for all four languages of study. Specifically, at least 92.5% of the sentences in s1s CoTs are in English only and do not mix languages. However, in the remaining cases when s1 mixes languages during reasoning, it primarily follows sophisticated pattern to which we refer as quote-and-think. Particularly, s1 will first quote certain words or phrases, often from the input question, and then interpret their meanings and implications during its thinking process. This is demonstrated by the quoted phrase 白色の繊維をその半分用いる and s1s literal translation white fibers the half amount in Box 1. In linguistics, this type of language-mixing is known as foreign-language quotation [54]. This language-mixing behavior happens due to crosslingual generalization of the quoting-and-thinking reasoning characteristic in s1s English finetuning data (see Appendix C.4). We want to emphasize that the quote-and-think pattern goes beyond simple translation. As demonstrated in Box 1, s1 builds upon the extracted phrase and synthesizes new multilingual setting where if the question had asked 白色の繊維を2巻分とその半分 (two and half rolls of white fiber) it would have arrived at different answer. Here, the model shows an understanding of how the syntactic structure in Japanese affects the semantic meaning of the math problem, which suggests that s1 is genuinely parsing and reasoning about the mathematical relationships expressed in Japanese and not merely translating the content to English before processing. This suggests that the multilingual capability of the base models is preserved for natural language understanding and allows s1 to reason about what it has understood about the question. Other language-mixing patterns Figure 3 shows that, compared to other languages, Russian exhibits intersentential language-mixingmixing of sentences of different languagesthe most, where English sentences are switched into Russian sentences and then back to English in the middle of the reasoning. This is undesirable [5] because it can create confusion for users expecting coherent response in single language and thus impacting readability. For intrasentential languagemixingmixing of words of different languages in single sentencewe perform deeper analysis (see Appendix C.5) and report that at least 70% of cases resemble quote-and-think as the non-English phrases are extracted from the question prompt, but no quotation marks were provided. This further confirms that quote-and-think is the dominant pattern of language mixing in s1s reasoning process, even when not explicitly marked, and represents natural strategy the model has developed to handle multilingual mathematical reasoning."

Prefix (prefix): We appended prefix string translation-equivalent of Okay, let me try to figure this out. at the beginning of the reasoning generation in order to guide the models generation in our chosen language. We also apply the translated_wait strategy and append the translated Wait token. System Prompt (system): We use system prompt to control the language use in model generation. Specifically, we translate the system prompt You are helpful assistant.4 into our chosen language and add the translation-equivalent of the instruction You must think and answer only in {language}. Combined (combined): This method uses all the techniques above to maximize control over the models reasoning language. We experiment with language forcing on the MGSM benchmark with = 11 languages. Given question in language (i.e., query language), we force the model to reason in language (i.e., reasoning language). We compute two evaluation metrics: task accuracy and language compliance. The former follows the setup described in Section 3, whereas the latter measures the proportion of tokens generated in the intended reasoning language relative to tokens produced in other languages. In other words, language compliance quantifies the effectiveness of s1 in following explicit language constraints. To only measure the effect of reasoning language and eliminate the confounding factors such as introduction of prefix string, our baseline is to let s1 models think in its dominant language English using the combined setup. 4We remove the part of You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. because English proper nouns like Qwen and Alibaba do not have translation equivalents in many non-English languages. 8 Table 3: Performance scores across different reasoning languages given query language.

Here, we focus on analyzing if we should perform in-language forcing for English-centric RLMs or let models reason in their natural reasoning language (i.e., English for s1). We showcase an example of s1 thinking in Japanese due to language forcing in Appendix D.1. Reasoning in high-resource languages As shown in Table 2, reasoning in high-resource languages (HRLs) achieve similar scorestypically within 1-2 points difference compared to baselineregardless of language forcing strategy. One possible explanation is that these languages are highly represented within pretraining of Qwen, which allows for effective crosslingual transfer from English reasoning finetuning. Reasoning in low-resource languages Table 2 highlights that, in contrast to HRLs, for lowresource languages (LRLs), combined strategy substantially underperforms the baseline. This suggests that English reasoning finetuning does not transfer to LRLs as effectively, and thus s1 is relatively incapable of reasoning in LRLs. Strategies that permit mix of English and the target languageparticularly translated_wait and systemoutperform strict in-language approaches such as combined. This is because s1 can lean on its English reasoning ability while incorporating the target language, which appears to be beneficial in scenarios with limited language-specific training data. For example, in (te) and (sw), the 14B and 32B models using translated_wait consistently outperform those using prefix or combined strategies by 45 accuracy points (see Appendix D.3 for detailed results). Trade-off between accuracy and language compliance Table 2 shows that we can successfully control the reasoning language of RLMs in their long CoTs, but that usually come at cost of task performance. For instance, for both 32Band 14B-sized s1 models, the combined strategy achieves near 100% language compliance for both HRLs and LRLs, but it yields the worst accuracy compared to other language forcing strategies. For 7B-sized models, we observe that we need combination of all strategies (i.e., combined) to achieve high language compliance. This suggests that it is non-trivial to control the reasoning language, as different choices of language forcing strategy can significantly affect how consistently s1 adhere to our specified reasoning language. 6.3 Crosslingual Language Forcing Given our success in controlling the reasoning language of s1 with combined strategy, we explore if there is particular language that is best served as reasoning language for s1. Particular, for each 9 Figure 4: Language and domain breakdown for Global-MMLU benchmark. Dashed lines indicate the performance of zero-shot prompting of Qwen-32B-Instruct models. query language , we force the model to all possible languages, resulting in an exhaustive query-reasoning language-pair analysis.5 Performance comparison of reasoning languages Table 3 shows that reasoning in HRLs such as en, fr, or de yield similarly high performance (the accuracy difference is within 1 to 2 points), with English being the most performant reasoning language and French being the close second. We discover two surprising findings: first, even though the Qwen2.5 base model is highly pretrained in Chinese [16], it is not necessarily the best reasoning language, even when the question is asked in zh; second, neither reasoning in en nor in query language necessarily yields the best performancequite the contrary, even reasoning in languages that are usually less represented in pretraining data [55] such as ru and th can achieve the best performance for query languages in other families such as ja. Lastly, we observe that languages that are considered as slightly less-resourced [55] such as th and bn still achieve nearly 80% overall accuracy, but further lower-resourced languages such as sw or te result in substantially lower overall accuracy. Inference cost analysis Our analysis of inference costs across reasoning languages in Figure 5 reveals significant negative correlation (-0.811) between token count and mathematical problem-solving accuracy. Reasoning in LRLs not only underperform their HRL counterpart (with accuracy below 80%), but they also demand substantially more computational resources at test-timeoften exceeding 3,000 tokens in their long CoTs for bn, sw, and te. This token efficiency disparity at test-time translates directly to computational costs; for instance, reasoning in Swahili requires approximately 3.5 times more compute than French for the same tasks. This is very likely due to the well-known tokenization disparity for LRLs, where tokenized lengths for an equivalent sentence in different languages are much larger for LRLs [56, 57]. Figure 5: MGSM accuracy against number of thinking tokens in s1 models outputs in different reasoning languages. 5This analysis is is computationally heavy, so we only focus on 14B-sized s1 models. 10 Figure 6: Effects of thinking time for s1 models on different domains of Global-MMLU benchmark (subfigure (a)) and cultural commonsense knowledge (FORK) and reasoning (COPAL-ID) benchmarks (subfigure (b)). Similar to Figure 4, we added dashed lines as zero-shot prompting of Qwen-32B as baselines in (b). Choice of query language Table 3 sheds light on whether we should translate inputs into HRLs such as English for reasoning tasks, which has proven to be an effective strategy [32, 33]. Our results are consistent with prior work: merely translating the question from Swahili to French can boost the accuracy from 59.6 to 90.8 even when the model reasons in Frencha language that s1 is not trained to reason in. Besides, based on the range column, which measures difference between the best and worst reasoning languages for particular query language, the model is less sensitive to query language in HRLs than in LRLs as exhibited by the smaller range. In other words, querying s1 in HRLs increases the models consistency in achieving the same correct answer with different reasoning languages."

            "content": "Since s1 models obtain strong crosslingual math performance with English-only training, natural question to ask is whether such generalization extends to other non-math domains that may require knowledge recall or cultural reasoning. We address this research question RQ4 using the cross-domain benchmarks described in Section 3. 7.1 In-domain generalization STEM domains Figure 6 (a) shows that performance on STEM subject domain in Global-MMLU improves with test-time scaling of thinking tokens (cyan line). Furthermore, s1 outperforms its base model Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct (black dashed line for cyan blocks in Figure 4) by large margin, especially for bn and sw where both gain +19.8% (56.5% 76.1%) and +13.1% (82.6% 95.7%) accuracy respectively. Given that s1 training data includes OlympicArena dataset [58] that encompasses various STEM subject knowledge such as biology and astronomy, our results here further corroborates Section 4 findings on strong crosslingual in-domain generalization. 7.2 Out-of-domain generalization non-STEM domains We report two main observations. First, Figure 4 shows that the benefits of reasoning finetuning are domain-specific. For instance, business and social sciences domains gain slight improvements, but the medical domain experiences up to nearly 10% decrease in accuracy even for HRLs such as en and fr compared to the baseline Qwen model. Second, we report minimal cross-domain generalization of test-time scaling from Figure 6 (a). Domains such as medicine do not benefit from scaling up thinking tokens, as increasing maximum thinking tokens from 0.5k 11 Figure 7: Performance comparison between s1 and zero-shot prompting of Qwen baseline for culturally-agnostic (C-Agnostic) and culturally-specific (C-Specific) questions in different domains. Results are average across languages. to 4k tokens merely improves accuracy by only +0.8% (73.0% 73.8%), and further scaling to 8000 thinking tokens even reduces accuracy by 2.0% (73.0% 71.0%). Out of all non-STEM domains, business benefits the most from test-time scaling (+3.2%), but the accuracy gain still lags behind STEM domain (+11.5%) by huge margin. Cultural-specific knowledge and reasoning For cultural commonsense knowledge and reasoning benchmarks, we observe similar findings that there is minimal benefits of test-time scaling of s1. Figure 6 (b) shows that while reasoning finetuning improves overall model performance over Qwen baselines (dashed lines), scaling up test-time thinking compute does not improve performance. In fact, for the English FORK benchmark, increasing thinking tokens leads to substantially poorer performance. This is also known as overthinking [59] where reasoning models expend excessive compute in their long CoTs and lead to worse performance [60, 61, 62]. As for Global MMLU, which contains additional annotations for whether questions belong to culturespecific or culture-agnostic types, Figure 7 shows that there is no obvious pattern explaining which type benefits the most from the s1-training. For the STEM category, the improvements are almost equivalent. However, in other domains, we observe inconsistent performance change. For instance, we observe that performance drops in the humanities subject mostly belong to the culture-specific type while the opposite for the medical domain. We also experiment with language forcing (using the combined strategy from Section 6) to see if reasoning in the same language as the question helps with performance, but we observe minimal and often inconsistent performance gains from language forcing (see Appendix E.2 for more details)."

            "content": "Data-efficient English reasoning finetuning One notable finding from our work is that s1 remains capable of generating text in different languages and experiences minimal catastrophic forgettinga phenomenon where the model loses its ability to generate fluent text in other languages after languagespecific supervised finetuning [63, 64]. In contrast, R1-Distill-Qwen baseline experiences significant catastrophic forgetting for low-resource languages. This suggests that data-efficient finetuning with small number of reasoning finetuning steps (s1 is only trained with 1k English samples for 5 epochs) is advisable for English-centric reasoning finetuning to preserve multilingual capability. Reasoning finetuning with multilingual data Given the limitations of crosslingual test-time scalingpoor reasoning in low-resource languages and in cross-domain settingsone potential solution would be to curate multilingual reasoning training data with wide language and domain coverage. However, the current practice of generating multilingual reasoning training data simply through translation technology [39, 17] is insufficient, as it is well-established that translation models including LLMs still suffer from poor cultural alignment and Western-centric bias [65, 66] as well as poor translation performance with low-resource languages [67, 68, 69]. Future work 12 should systematically explore the effectiveness of multilingual augmentation techniques such as back-translation or synthetic data generation [70, 71]. Reasoning in low-resource languages (LRLs) Our results indicate poor performance of using LRLs as reasoning language. Furthermore, unfairness in tokenization for LRLs [56] leads to significantly higher inference costs for test-time scaling of RLMs. This disparity creates accessibility barriers for multilingual communities, as deploying reasoning models in LRLs becomes prohibitively expensive. Future work should focus on developing more equitable tokenization strategies for reasoning across diverse languages [72, 73, 74]. Crosslingual generalization for small RLMs Our observation of successful crosslingual test-time scaling happening at 3B parameter threshold corroborates contemporary work that shows small models below 3B parameters struggle to learn from long CoTs [75] and generalize in multilingual settings [17]. While there are ongoing work creating English-centric RLMs smaller than 3B size [28], we argue that future work on small RLMs should benchmark on multilingual reasoning tasks rather than solely on English data. This would not only advance the development of multilingual reasoning models but also help identify factors that enable crosslingual reasoning."

We also investigate the effects of the choice of reasoning languages as well as query languages, demonstrating that successful generalization of English reasoning finetuning to other high-resource languages. Finally, we observe minimal cross-domain generalization of test-time scaling, thus highlighting the need for future work to explore more robust and domain-agnostic reasoning strategies, particularly for multilingual applications."

Then, we use the NLP library stanza to perform sentence segmentation according to the matrix language and obtain individual sentences. Finally, we use lingua to annotate the language label of each sentence and of each individual word token in the sentence. 22 Table 7: MGSM performance comparison against 1.5B-sized s1 model with maximum 8k thinking tokens.

We refer our readers to Appendix C.2 for our annotation procedures. We focus on four languages, namely Japanese (ja), Russian (ru), Thai (th), and Mandarin Chinese (zh), as they are readily supported by the libraries stanza and lingua. We avoid languages with Latin scripts due to their possible shared vocabulary with English and results in incorrect language classification. For instance, the German word also (therefore) in the sentence Sie isst 3 Eier zum Frühstück und verwendet 4 Eier für Muffins, also verwendet sie insgesamt 3 + 4 = 7 Eier pro Tag. was misclassified as English word. C.2 Annotation for Language-Mixing Patterns in s1 Reasoning We collect the language label with the highest probability assigned to the entire sentence, and we label sentence belonging to intersentential language-mixing for s1 if the sentence is non-English, as the dominant language of s1s overall output is English. We then check language labels for individual word tokens. If there are mixing of different languages within the same sentence, and quotation marks are present around the non-English words or phrases, then the sentence is assigned with the quote-and-think label. Otherwise, if quotation marks are not present, the sentence is assigned with the intrasentential label. C.3 Dominant Language in 14B-Sized Model Outputs Figure 8 shows the dominant language distribution in model outputs when MGSM questions are asked in Japanese (ja), Russian (ru), Thai (th), and Mandarin Chinese (zh). Figure 8: Proportion of dominant languages used by 14B-sized models responses when queried with Japanese (ja), Russian (ru), Thai (th), and Mandarin Chinese (zh) languages. same indicates that the response language is the same as query language. C.4 Quote-And-Think Pattern in s1s Training Data Among 1k English training samples of s1 models, 68.3% of the samples exhibit the quote-and-think pattern, among which at least half of them involves directly copying from the question prompts. This suggests that the quote-and-think language-mixing pattern is due to crosslingual transfer of the 23 original s1 models learned behavior of quoting phrases from question prompts during its long CoTs thinking process. C.5 Fine-Grained Analysis of s1-32Bs Intrasentential Language Mixing We perform human annotations on the intrasententially language-mixed sentences during reasoning and classify if each sentence belongs to one of the following categories: (1) extract-and-explain, where the non-English phrases are taken directly from the original input prompt but without quotation marks given (this resembles quote-and-think but no quotation marks are generated around the nonEnglish phrases); (2) insertional code-switching, where non-English lexical items (usually nouns) are inserted into the morphosyntactic frame of the English sentence (an example would be want to eat nasi goreng where nasi goreng is Malay word for fried rice), and (3) clause-level codeswitching, where switching between two languages within single sentence structure at clausal level (an example would be want to go to the library dan bersedia untuk peperiksaan where dan bersedia untuk peperiksaan is Malay clause for and prepare for the exam.) Figure 9 demonstrates the distribution of each category, with extract-and-explain being the dominant language-mixing patterns.

How many rolls are needed total?) s1s Thinking: よし解いてみよう問題はローブを作るために必要な繊維の巻 数を計算するものだね青色の繊維が2巻必要で白色の繊維はその半分つま り1巻必要だだから合計で3巻かでも待って問題文をもう一度確認しよう ロ ー ブ を 作 成 する には 青 色 の 繊 維 を2巻 分 白 色 の 繊 維 をそ の半 分 用 い る必要があります全体で何巻必要ですかそうだ青色が2巻白色がその半 分つまり青色の半分は1巻だから白色は1巻必要だから合計3巻これでいい のかなでももしかして青色の2巻と白色の半分を足すと2 + 0.5 = 2.5巻って意 味じゃないのだろうかでも問題の言い回しが少しややこしいな 待 って 原 文 をも う一 度 青 色 の 繊 維 を2巻 分 白 色 の 繊 維 をそ の半 分 用 いるというのは青色が2巻そして白色がその半分つまり青色の半 分なのかそれとも2巻の半分なのか日本語の文法で考えるとその半 分は直前の数詞2巻分を指している可能性が高いつまり青色2巻白 色は2巻の半分なので1巻だから合計3巻でももし青色の繊維を2巻分白 色の繊維をその半分というのが青色が2巻白色が青色の半分つまり1巻 という意味なら同じく3巻結局同じ結果になるのか そ れ に 問 題 が 全 体 で 何 巻 必 要 で す か と 聞 い て い る の で 必 要 な 総 巻数を聞かれているのだろうつまり青色2巻白色1巻合計3巻これが答え だと思われるでももしこの問題が英語だとhow many rolls are needed in total? だと仮定すると3 rolls が答え でももしかして青色2巻白色半分つま り2.5巻という解釈もあるでも問題文の日本語の表現からすると青色2巻 白色1巻合計3巻が妥当だと思う ...

E.2 Language Forcing for GlobalMMLU We further study if forcing s1 to reason in the same language as the question helps with performance, as different languages may have different knowledge recall mechanism [76], and retrieving the right knowledge will help with MMLU-style questions [77]. Following the findings in Section 6, we use the combined language forcing strategy that yields the highest language compliance in multilingual generations. Table 13 shows marginal performance improvements for reasoning language in HRLs with Latin scripts, such as German (de), English (en) and French (fr). We want to highlight that the performance gain from language forcing is inconsistent: for instance, in-language reasoning for German business subject questions improves accuracy by around 3% but decreases accuracy for humanities subject by nearly 5%. For Chinese, even though it is one of the highly represented languages during pretraining of the base model Qwen, reasoning in Chinese introduces minor performance degradation even for STEM domain. For the even lower-resourced languages like Bengali (bn) and Swahili (sw), language forcing leads to performance degradationthere is around 6% decrease on average across domains. In general, the patterns for non-math-specific domains are similar that reasoning in HRLs would be more beneficial compared to LRLs; nonetheless the latter could be more friendly in user-facing setting and could potentially help with easier verification for more cultural-specific tasks. 26 Strategy Reasoning Language Table 9: Results for s1-14B. avg len Language Distribution Language Compliance translated_wait prefix system combined bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh 2457.1 1940.1 1638.2 1966.1 2062.6 2162.1 1937.9 3044.8 3852.4 1767.3 1438.9 ENGLISH: 100.0 ENGLISH: 76.4, GERMAN: 23.6 ENGLISH: 100.0 ENGLISH: 94.4, SPANISH: 5.6 ENGLISH: 95.2, FRENCH: 4.4, CHINESE: 0.4 ENGLISH: 86.8, JAPANESE: 13.2 ENGLISH: 98.8, RUSSIAN: 0.8, CHINESE: 0.4 ENGLISH: 99.6, SWAHILI: 0.4 ENGLISH: 98.8, CHINESE: 0.4, TELUGU: 0.8 ENGLISH: 100.0 ENGLISH: 62.0, CHINESE: 38. 4570.1 BENGALI: 92.8, ENGLISH: 7.2 1621.8 GERMAN: 100.0 ENGLISH: 100.0 1572.2 SPANISH: 99.6, ENGLISH: 0.4 2343.2 FRENCH: 99.6, ENGLISH: 0.4 1354.3 2194.3 JAPANESE: 99.2, ENGLISH: 0.8 1470.3 RUSSIAN: 98.8, CHINESE: 0.8, ENGLISH: 0.4 4442.6 6041.8 2448.6 1149.3 CHINESE: 100.0 SWAHILI: 85.2, ENGLISH: 14.4, TAGALOG: 0.4 TELUGU: 90.4, ENGLISH: 9.2, CHINESE: 0.4 THAI: 88.4, CHINESE: 10.8, ENGLISH: 0.8 2196.2 ENGLISH: 99.2, BENGALI: 0.8 1643.4 GERMAN: 92.8, ENGLISH: 7.2 ENGLISH: 100.0 1664.3 ENGLISH: 84.4, SPANISH: 15.6 1766.7 ENGLISH: 91.6, FRENCH: 8.4 1841.7 2036.4 JAPANESE: 17.2, ENGLISH: 82.8 1631.3 RUSSIAN: 49.2, ENGLISH: 50.8 2984.6 3942.8 1775.4 1295.8 ENGLISH: 98.8, SWAHILI: 1.2 ENGLISH: 91.6, TELUGU: 8.4 ENGLISH: 91.6, THAI: 8.0, CHINESE: 0.4 ENGLISH: 12.0, CHINESE: 88.0 4823.5 BENGALI: 98.0, ENGLISH: 2.0 1479.8 GERMAN: 100.0 ENGLISH: 100.0 1553.2 SPANISH: 100.0 2503.3 FRENCH: 100.0 1269.8 1941.4 JAPANESE: 100.0 1577.6 RUSSIAN: 99.6, CHINESE: 0.4 SWAHILI: 88.4, ENGLISH: 11.6 4525.5 TELUGU: 93.6, ENGLISH: 6.4 6046.9 2244.8 THAI: 92.4, CHINESE: 7.2, ENGLISH: 0.4 1118.8 CHINESE: 100.0 0.0 23.6 100.0 5.6 4.4 13.2 0.8 0.4 0.8 0.0 38. 92.8 100.0 100.0 99.6 99.6 99.2 98.8 85.2 90.4 88.4 100.0 0.8 92.8 100.0 15.6 8.4 17.2 49.2 1.2 8.4 8.0 88.0 98.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 99.6 88.4 93.6 92.4 100.0 27 Strategy Reasoning Language Table 10: Results for s1-7B. avg len Language Distribution Language Compliance translated_wait prefix system combined bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh bn de en es fr ja ru sw te th zh 3355.8 2490.5 2050.4 3156.8 2544.1 3381.9 2742.3 5381.5 5232.8 2654.8 1471.1 CHINESE: 99.2, ENGLISH: 0.8 ENGLISH: 100.0 ENGLISH: 68.0, GERMAN: 32.0 ENGLISH: 100.0 ENGLISH: 83.6, SPANISH: 16.4 ENGLISH: 90.4, FRENCH: 9.2, CHINESE: 0.4 ENGLISH: 72.0, JAPANESE: 28.0 ENGLISH: 96.0, RUSSIAN: 2.8, CHINESE: 1.2 ENGLISH: 100.0 ENGLISH: 97.6, TELUGU: 2.4 ENGLISH: 89.6, THAI: 8.4, CHINESE: 2.
