Introduction Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven their widespread adoption across various domains (Achiam et al., 2023; Anthropic, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), serving variety of individuals from highly skilled experts to non-technical, everyday users (Bommasani et al., 2021). To ensure safe deployment, significant efforts have been made to align these models (Bai et al., 2022a;b; Ganguli et al., 2022; Markov et al., 2023). However, these *Equal contribution 1Brown University 2Columbia University 3Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Correspondence to: Yik Siu Chan <yik siu chan@brown.edu>. 1Our code is available at https://github.com/ yiksiu-chan/SpeakEasy. 1 efforts face ongoing challenges from jailbreaks (Jin et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024), adversarial attacks that aim to breach LLMs safety mechanisms and induce harmful responses, which pose societal risks when used by malicious actors (Hendrycks et al., 2023). Despite the widespread adoption of LLMs by non-technical users, current research offers limited insights into how jailbreaks manifest in simple, everyday interactions. Existing jailbreak methods typically require technical understanding of models internal mechanisms (Zou et al., 2023) or extensive engineering efforts (Chao et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023). These settings, however, may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios where an average user attempts to misuse LLMs for malicious purposes (NPR, 2025). To address this gap, we investigate two questions: (1) What kinds of jailbroken responses enable non-technical users to induce harm? (2) Can these responses be obtained through simple interactions with an LLM? To answer the first question, we identify four attributes (Xing et al., 2017; Cho et al., 2019; Ganguli et al., 2022) potentially related to harmfulness and curate synthetic dataset in which each example demonstrates combination of these attributes. Through human evaluation, we determine actionability and informativeness as key attributes in inducing harm when the jailbroken response is followed by individuals without specialized knowledge. On this basis, we introduce HARMSCORE, metric that explicitly measures the aforementioned attributes and provides more fine-grained assessment of jailbreak harmfulness than commonly used measures of success (e.g., Attack Success Rate (ASR) (Ganguli et al., 2022; Mazeika et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024)). Notably, HARMSCORE aligns better with human judgments than ASR, especially for queries that seek practical instructions. To demonstrate that simple interactions can sufficiently elicit actionable and informative jailbreaks, we propose SPEAK EASY. In contrast to other jailbreak frameworks, SPEAK EASY emulates two types of human-LLM interactions commonly observed in real-world examples (Deng et al., 2024b; Zhao et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024): multi-step reasoning and multilingual querying. Given harmful query, users can decompose it into multiple seemingly innocuous subqueries (Dua et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022), which more easily circumvent safety guardrails. They can SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions further exploit the multilingual knowledge (Ahuja et al., 2023) and vulnerabilities (Yong et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2024a) in LLMs by translating the subqueries to various languages. Using these two tools, non-technical user can generate harmful response to the original malicious query by selecting the most actionable and informative responses to subqueries. SPEAK EASY automates this process by employing response selection models fine-tuned for the two attributes. Altogether, SPEAK EASY is an accessible jailbreak framework that simulates how non-expert users would realistically seek harmful content. To systematically evaluate our proposed framework, we target safety-aligned proprietary and open-source multilingual LLMs including GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), Qwen2-72BInstruct (Yang et al., 2024), and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024), across four jailbreak benchmarks (Zou et al., 2023; Mazeika et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024). Notably, SPEAK EASY increases the ASR of GPT-4o from 0.092 to 0.555 on average across four benchmarks, and its HARMSCORE from 0.180 to 0.759, all through simple inference easily accessible to users. SPEAK EASY can also be readily integrated into existing jailbreak methods for users with technical expertise. Incorporating SPEAK EASY into GCG-T (Zou et al., 2023) and TAPT (Mehrotra et al., 2023) significantly outperforms their vanilla baselines, yielding an average absolute increase of 0.313 in ASR and 0.398 in HARMSCORE across LLMs and benchmarks. We further demonstrate through ablation studies that using more decomposition steps and languages in SPEAK EASY increases response harmfulness. We summarize our contributions in this paper as follows: We identify actionability and informativeness as key attributes that constitute harmful jailbreak response. We introduce HARMSCORE, metric grounded in the aforementioned attributes that aligns competitively with human judgments. We show that SPEAK EASY, simple multi-step and multilingual jailbreak framework, significantly increases the likelihood of harmful responses in both proprietary and open-source LLMs. 2. Related Work Jailbreaking LLMs. Methods to jailbreak safety-aligned LLMs range from manual approaches to automated techniques, including gradient-based token optimization (Zhu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Liao & Sun, 2024), multiagent prompt augmentation (Perez et al., 2022; Chao et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023), and custom inference templates (?Anil et al., 2024). However, these methods often require technical expertise and intensive computation, making them less accessible to average users and less suited for evaluating LLM safety in real-world scenarios. In contrast, we explore the potential to elicit harmful outputs through simple natural language interactions in realistic scenarios. Jailbreak Evaluation. To systematically evaluate model safety against jailbreak methods, several benchmarks have been proposed (Mazeika et al., 2024; Chao et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024). These benchmarks typically focus on jailbreak success, where model responses are evaluated by an LLM judge using metrics including compliance (Zou et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024), fulfillment (Xie et al., 2024), harmfulness (Huang et al., 2024b), validity (Zhu et al., 2023), and specificity (Souly et al., 2024). In contrast, we examine the underlying attributes of harmful responses that malicious, non-expert user seeks. Common Human-LLM Interactions. To help LLMs better understand user intent and solve complex problems, prompt design strategies, such as demonstrated reasoning steps (Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022) and query decomposition (Perez et al., 2020; Dua et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023), have gained popularity in user interactions (Deng et al., 2024b). Additionally, LLMs multilingual ability (Fu et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023; Ahuja et al., 2023) further enhances accessibility for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds. However, the ease of interaction also introduces risks, as malicious users may exploit multi-step reasoning capabilities (Shaikh et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023), multi-turn conversations (Li et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024a), or safety loopholes in midand low-resource languages (Yong et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024b). In fact, such behaviors already exist in real-world user-LLM interaction logs (Zhao et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2024b). Our work aims to demonstrate the simplicity and efficacy of manipulating these interaction modes for harmful jailbreaks. 3. What Constitutes Harmful Jailbreak? Existing evaluation metrics predominantly score jailbreak responses with explicit measures of success, such as ASR (Mazeika et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024). However, relying solely on success rates may lead to misalignments with human judgment (Souly et al., 2024). This gap raises the need for more precise measurements that better align with human perceptions, particularly in terms of how useful the jailbroken responses are for malicious actors. We first identify four attributes that relate to characterizing the harmfulness of jailbreak response by drawing from red-teaming and computational linguistics literature: Actionability measures if response has clear steps, specific action verbs, and objects that assist user in carrying out harmful actions (Ganguli et al., 2022). Coherence measures if response is logically connected (Cho et al., 2019) and contains consistent information (Malkin et al., 2022) such that malicious user can easily understand the response. 2 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions Attribute χ2 Test Fleiss κ Lasso Coef.

We illustrate the evaluation process in Figure 1 with additional details in A.3. We include our results in Table 1. First, we conduct χ2 test to demonstrate that the augmented responses exhibit statistically significant correlations with human judgements for all four attributes, confirming the efficacy of the augmentations by GPT-4. We also observe Fleiss κ > 0 for all four attributes, indicating strong inter-annotator agreement. Then, we use Lasso regression to investigate which attributes most influence the harmfulness of jailbreak responses. The learned coefficients demonstrate that informativeness exhibits the greatest impact on harmfulness followed by actionability, while coherence and conciseness show less influence. Hence, we focus on measuring actionability and informativeness by proposing new metric, which we cover in 3.2 below. 3.2. Jailbreak Evaluation with HARMSCORE Now, we consider measuring harmfulness through the lens of actionability and informativeness through our metric termed HARMSCORE. First, note that harmful response should be both actionable and informative: An actionable response with poor informativeness may include irrelevant instructions, while an informative but unactionable response may only provide information without guiding actions. We can realize this notion via the geometric mean of jailbreak responses actionability and informativeness scores. Concretely, given malicious query Q, jailbreak response R, and metrics fA(Q, R) [0, 1] and fI (Q, R) [0, 1] which respectively score the actionability and informativeness of in response to Q, we define HARMSCORE as: HARMSCORE(Q, R) = 1[R = ] (cid:112)fA(Q, R) fI (Q, R), where the indicator function determines whether contains any predefined refusal strings (Mehrotra et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Mazeika et al., 2024). In words, if the response does not refuse to engage with the malicious query Q, we assess the harmfulness of by computing the geometric mean of its actionability and informativeness scores. Figure 1. Process flow of human evaluation to identify attributes contributing to jailbreak harmfulness. We collect and curate 10 harmful base examples that meet all four attributes and augment each response into 16 variants with different attribute combinations using GPT-4. Human annotators then assess each variant for the four attributes and the overall harm level. Conciseness measures how effectively information is communicated maximally in terms of response length (Renze & Guven, 2024). Informativeness measures if the response provides relevant, meaningful details, such as explaining specific terms and clarifying the impact of an action (Xing et al., 2017; Ke et al., 2018).2 We include examples for each of the four attributes in A.2. To identify the relationship between the four attributes and the harmfulness of jailbreak response, we conduct human evaluation using synthetic test set. We describe the procedure in 3.1 below. 3.1. Human Evaluation on Jailbreak Attributes To construct the synthetic test set, we first curate 10 high-quality jailbreak query-response pairs from the HarmBench validation set. As each of the four attributes can either be present or absent, we collect 16 unique combinations for given query-response pair. We augment the original response to incorporate specific combinations of attribute settings by prompting GPT-4 and generate total of 160 pairs. Given the augmented pairs, we recruit 20 annotators to evaluate two factors: (1) the efficacy of GPT-4s augmentations by whether annotators can identify the ap2Following Mazeika et al. (2024), we prioritize the relevance of the provided information over the correctness of the content. 3 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions 4. Jailbreaks Through Simple Interactions In real-world interactions between human users and LLMs, conversations often extend beyond single-instance questionanswering (Wang et al., 2024c). Users may engage in multiturn interactions, pose follow-up questions, or communicate in languages other than English, as evidenced by millions of conversations in user-LLM interaction datasets (Zhao et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2024b). However, common interactions can also be exploited for malicious purposes. Consider the left interaction in Figure 2, sourced from WildVis (Deng et al., 2024b). The user gradually seeks suggestions for suicidal drugs through multi-turn conversation starting with drug-related query. This act resembles the decomposition of complex task into modular subtasks (Khot et al., 2023), where, similarly, harmful instructions can be decomposed into seemingly benign subqueries to bypass safeguards. Another frequently observed interaction mode is multilingual conversations, with nearly half of the real-world interaction logs in WildChat (Zhao et al., 2024) conducted in languages other than English. The right interaction in Figure 2 displays conversation from WildVis where the LLM complies with users request for drug abuse instructions in Spanish. Since safety training is typically conducted in English, if malicious request triggers refusal in English, users can simply rephrase it in another language, increasing the likelihood of receiving an affirmative response (Yong et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2024a; Shen et al., 2024). 4.1. The SPEAK EASY Jailbreak Framework Based on observations of misuse in real-world multi-step and multilingual interactions, we design SPEAK EASY to simulate how non-expert users realistically pursue harmful content and visualize the jailbreak framework in Figure 3. Given malicious query Q, SPEAK EASY prompts the target LLM to decompose it into subqueries, = {q1, . . . , qm}. We manually curate query decompositions (Dua et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023) of benign tasks as in-context learning examples (additional details in B.1). In Figure 3, the query making dimethylmercury is decomposed into three steps, beginning with identifying materials containing mercury and then inquiring about synthesizing dimethylmercury from them. To obtain useful information from each subquery, SPEAK EASY exploits multilingual vulnerabilities by prompting the target LLM with subqueries translated into predefined set of languages, = {L1, . . . , Ln}, spanning different resource groups (Joshi et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2023). The responses are then translated back into English3, forming pool of candidate responses, Ri = {ri,1, . . . , ri,n}, for 3English is used as the default base language, as existing jailbreaking benchmarks are predominantly in English. Figure 2. Real-world human-LLM interactions from WildVis. The left example illustrates multi-step user-LLM interaction with malicious query and subsequent follow-ups. In the right example, the multilingual LLM provides step-by-step instructions in response to malicious query in Spanish. each subquery qi Q. Finally, to identify the most preferred response for each subquery, we fine-tune response selection models, gA(q, r) and gI (q, r) [0, 1], for actionability and informativeness, respectively (see 4.2 for further details). Within the candidate response pool Ri for each subquery qi Q, SPEAK EASY selects the highest-scoring response: = argmaxri,j Ri gA(qi, ri,j) + gI (qi, ri,j). 1, . . . , The example in Figure 3 shows responses selected from English, Zulu, and Ukrainian, respectively. These responses are concatenated to form the final jailbreak response, = (r m), to the original malicious query Q. Note that SPEAK EASY usually functions as standalone jailbreak framework for average users interacting with black-box LLM chatbot. Additionally, the simplicity and accessibility of the framework allow it to be integrated with existing jailbreak methods for technically advanced users. 4.2. Selecting Actionable and Informative Responses To train response selection models for measuring actionability and informativeness, we repurpose existing preference datasets for each attribute using GPT-4. We first summarize queries from the HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a) and Stack-Exchange-Preferences (Lambert et al., 2023) datasets into single sentences to match the format of typical jailbreak queries (Zou et al., 2023; Mazeika et al., 2024). For both attributes, we filter out irrelevant examples by assessing whether the queries can be answered with an actionable or informative response. The responses of the remaining examples are then annotated for each attribute, and we only retain examples with one response exhibiting the attribute and another lacking it. This process yields preference dataset comprising 27,000 valid query-preference pairs for each attribute, with examples in B.2. Using these datasets, we fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Touvron et al., 2023) as our response selection models for each attribute separately with iterative direct preference optimization (Xu et al., 2024) (See B.2 for additional training SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions Figure 3. Our SPEAK EASY jailbreak framework. Given malicious query, we (1) decompose it into multiple steps of seemingly harmless subqueries and (2) translate each subquery into set of predefined languages from different resource groups. We then (3) prompt multilingual LLMs with the translated subqueries at each step. After collecting the responses, we (4) translate them back into English and (5) select the most actionable and informative response for each subquery using our response selection models. Finally, (6) the selected responses are combined to form complete response to the original malicious query.

Evaluation results on human-annotated preference test sets. Our response selection models significantly outperform the baselines in selecting more actionable or informative responses. details). During response selection, we apply sigmoid function to the output scores and map them to the range [0, 1] to ensure both attributes are weighted equally. Evaluation. To evaluate our response selection models, we construct preference test sets using the human evaluation data from 3.1. For each query, we pair an actionable response with an unactionable one with replacement and produce 509 test examples. The model is required to assign higher score to the actionable response. We curate 455 examples for informativeness with the same procedure. We compare our models against popular off-the-shelf reward model baselines: (1) our base model, Llama-3.1-8BInstruct; (2) FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-v0.1 (Dong et al., 2023), which is fine-tuned on high-quality samples; (3) ArmoRMLlama3-8B-v0.1 (Wang et al., 2024a), optimized for multidimensional objectives. As shown in Table 2, our response selection models outperform these baselines significantly, especially for informativeness. These results confirm that our models align closely with human perceptions of actionability and informativeness. 5. Experiments We now evaluate SPEAK EASY by measuring its effectiveness in amplifying harmful jailbreaks. 5.1 outlines the experimental setup, and 5.2 validates HARMSCORE through human evaluation. In 5.3, we compare SPEAK EASY against existing jailbreak baselines through both ASR and HARMSCORE. Finally, we conduct ablation studies in 5.4 and analyze language usage in 5.5. 5.1. Experimental Setup In our main experiments, we evaluate three jailbreak baselines, both with and without SPEAK EASY using four benchmarks. We target three multilingual LLMs: the proprietary GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024) and the open-source Qwen2-72BInstruct (Qwen2) (Yang et al., 2024) and Llama-3.3-70BInstruct (Llama3.3) (Grattafiori et al., 2024). Jailbreak Baselines. We incorporate SPEAK EASY into the following three jailbreak baselines and observe the absolute change in jailbreak success and harmfulness: (1) Direct Request (DR) directly prompts the target LLM with malicious queries; (2) Greedy Coordinate Gradient-Transfer (GCGT) (Zou et al., 2023) appends an adversarial suffix to the query; (3) Tree of Attacks with Pruning-Transfer (TAP-T) (Mehrotra et al., 2023) utilizes tree-of-thought reasoning to iteratively refine malicious queries. These baselines are applied to the decomposed subqueries in SPEAK EASY during integration. More details are in B.3. Jailbreak Benchmarks. We evaluate on four jailbreak benchmarks, covering wide range of harm categories: (1) 5 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions Category HB-ASR GPT-ASR HARMSCORE chemical illegal misinformation harmful harassment cybercrime Overall 0.762 0.666 0.550 0.615 0.518 0.650 0. 0.864 0.696 0.501 0.679 0.690 0.870 0.723 0.881 0.780 0.424 0.695 0.715 0.761 0.726 Table 3. Pearson rank correlation between human judgment and the three metrics on HarmBench subsamples. HB-ASR and GPT-ASR are ASR variants using the HarmBench classifier and GPT-4o, respectively. GPT-ASR and HARMSCORE achieve competitive correlation, and both outperform HB-ASR by 0.09. HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024) with its standard split of 200 single-sentence queries; (2) AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) with 520 harmful instructions; (3) SORRY-Bench (Xie et al., 2024) with 450 harmful instructions; (4) MedSafetyBench (Han et al., 2024), where we randomly sample 50 examples from each of the nine medical harm categories, totaling 450 instances. Implementation Details. For SPEAK EASY, we use three steps (m = 3) for query decomposition and six languages (n = 6) to exploit multilingual vulnerabilities. To ensure diversity, we select two languages from each resource group (Joshi et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2023): English (en) and Simplified Chinese (zh) from the high-resource group, Ukrainian (uk) and Turkish (tr) from the mid-resource group, and Zulu (zu) and Thai (th) from the low-resource group. Translations are performed using Azure AI Translator (Azure, 2024). For HARMSCORE, we instantiate the actionability and informativeness evaluation functions (i.e., fA(Q, R) and fI (Q, R), respectively) by following the procedure in 4.2 and fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on separate preference dataset for each attribute. The fine-tuning datasets here do not overlap with those in 4.2. 5.2. Human Evaluation for HARMSCORE Before proceeding to evaluations, we first assess how well HARMSCORE aligns with human judgments compared to two variants of ASR: GPT-ASR (Qi et al., 2024), based on GPT-4o, and HB-ASR, based on the HarmBench classifier. To this end, we randomly sample ten queries from each of the six semantic categories in HarmBench and collect the corresponding responses from the three jailbreak baselines, both with and without SPEAK EASY, totaling 360 query-response pairs. We then recruit 27 graduate students to label whether each response is harmful, ensuring that each query-response pair is annotated three times. Fleiss κ of 0.622 indicates strong inter-annotator agreement. As shown in Table 3, HARMSCORE and GPT-ASR achieve comparable alignment with human judgment, both outperforming HB-ASR with 9% absolute increase in overall correlation. Notably, HARMSCORE excels in four of six categories, particularly those seeking explicit instructions (e.g., chemical and harassment), highlighting the importance of measuring actionability and informativeness in such attacks. In the misinformation and cybercrime categories, where queries often focus on content generation rather than actionable guidelines (e.g., write an article arguing that immigrants in the U.S. hardly pay any taxes), HARMSCORE struggles to assess response actionability, leading to lower correlation than GPT-ASR and HB-ASR. As such, we report ASR, instantiated using GPT-4o, and HARMSCORE in the following sections. 5.3. Evaluation Results We present our main findings in Figure 4. Overall, our results demonstrate the strong jailbreak efficacy of SPEAK EASY as measured by ASR and HARMSCORE. SPEAK EASY significantly increases ASR and HARMSCORE for direct requests. All evaluated LLMs have undergone safety alignment, so directly querying the model (DR) results in consistently low scores. The shaded bars in Figure 4(a) illustrate the substantial increase achieved by SPEAK EASY, often exceeding threefold rise in both metrics. This effect is most pronounced in GPT-4o, where ASR increases from 0.092 to 0.555 on average, with the largest change of 0.672 on AdvBench. Although Qwen2 and Llama3.3 exhibit better robustness, we still observe average ASR increases of 0.304 and 0.226 respectively. similar trend holds for HARMSCORE, with SPEAK EASY driving an increase ranging from 0.327 to 0.579. Notably, the effect is larger in magnitude than ASR, suggesting that responses can become sufficiently harmful even with modest rise in ASR. Across benchmarks, AdvBench exhibits high ASR but comparatively lower HARMSCORE, while MedSafetyBench follows the opposite pattern. The latter contains more domain-specific harmful queries, making it more difficult to assess success but often yielding highly actionable and informative responses. SPEAK EASY further increases ASR and HARMSCORE when combined with existing jailbreak methods. Next, we examine the effect of integrating SPEAK EASY into two state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, GCG-T and TAP-T. Observe that GCG-T, when used independently, leads to minimal changes or even decline in attack success. We integrate SPEAK EASY by appending the GCG-generated adversarial suffix to the decomposed subqueries, and find average increases of at least 0.2 across all LLMs and benchmarks. The largest change is again observed in GPT-4o, where ASR increases by 0.480 and HARMSCORE by 0.636 on average. Furthermore, we evaluate TAP-T, which already achieves high baseline scores. Despite its strong performance, SPEAK EASY further boosts ASR by 0.235 to 0.336 and HARMSCORE by 0.299 to 0.393 on average. Strikingly, for both GPT-4o and Llama3.3, this integration 6 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions Figure 4. Jailbreak performance measured by ASR and HARMSCORE before and after integrating SPEAK EASY into the baselines, with the shaded bars highlighting the difference. SPEAK EASY significantly increases both ASR and HARMSCORE across almost all methods. See Table 10 for full numerical values. yields an ASR that exceeds 0.9 across all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that SPEAK EASY is versatile framework that can be integrated into existing methods, further enhancing the success and harmfulness of attacks. 5.4. Ablation Studies When interacting with LLMs in multi-step and multilingual manner, users can adjust the number of steps, the choice of languages, and the selection of responses at each stage of the process. Here, we examine how these three components in SPEAK EASY influence the jailbreak responses harmfulness. By default, we use GPT-4o as the backbone with DR + SPEAK EASY and HarmBench as the target benchmark. Unless otherwise specified, we use three decomposition steps, six languages, and our fine-tuned response selection models. We present our results in Table 4. Number of Query Decomposition Steps. We vary the number of decomposition steps, {1, 3, 5}. Setting = 1 corresponds to the multilingual jailbreak method (Yong et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2024a) using six languages. Increasing from 1 to 3 introduces the query decomposition component, which significantly increases ASR from 0.115 to 0.560 and HARMSCORE from 0.154 to 0.779. We attribute this to the effectiveness of the decomposition process in breaking down harmful query into seemingly harmless subqueries. Namely, we find that while GPT-4o refuses to respond in 81% of single-step multilingual queries (m = 1), the refusal rate drops sharply to 1.5% for = 3 (as measured by when one or more of the subqueries Ablation Setting ASR HARMSCORE Number of Steps Number of Languages Response Selection 1 3 1 3 6 9 Random Fixed-Lang.

Jailbreak performance of ablated SPEAK EASY settings. The default setting uses three steps, six languages, and our finetuned response selection models (bolded). ASR and HARMSCORE increase with decomposition steps and languages. Under Oracle (the upper bound of scores), our response selection models outperform all alternative approaches. elicit refusal). As we vary from 3 to 5, ASR shows smaller increase while HARMSCORE sees slight decline, which we hypothesize is due to additional subqueries introducing irrelevant information that lowers HARMSCORE. We provide details on the refusal rate and the respective actionability and informativeness scores in C. Number of Jailbreak Languages. We vary the number of languages {1, 3, 6, 9}, where = 1 represents querying only in English in three steps. When changing from 3 to 9, we respectively use 1 to 3 languages from SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions each resource group (high, medium, and low). In Table 4, observe that both ASR and HARMSCORE increase with n, which corroborates previous findings on multilingual vulnerabilities (Deng et al., 2024a). However, we observe diminishing gains beyond using six languages for both ASR and HARMSCORE. This suggests an inherent upper bound of multilingual jailbreak, where adding more languages beyond certain count has limited effects. Response Selection Methods. As introduced in 4.2, we fine-tune our response selection models to emulate how users may choose the most actionable and informative response for each subquery in SPEAK EASY. Here, we explore alternative selection strategies: (1) Random, which randomly selects response at each subquery, (2) FixedLanguage, which always selects responses from the same language, and we report the highest scores among the six languages; (3) Fixed-Combination, which follows one of the 63 = 216 possible ways of combining the six languages across the three subqueries, and we report the best performing combination; (4) Oracle, which serves as performance upper bound by dynamically choosing responses with known ASR and HARMSCORE. Our response selection models achieve the next best performance, followed by Random. Both significantly outperform the fixed methods, which are limited to single language or predetermined combination. The multilingual responses to subqueries are already actionable and informative, so leveraging the full range of available responses proves more effective than fixed methods. The remaining gap between our response selection models and Oracle indicates room for further improvement. Overall, our ablation results highlight the efficacy of adding additional decomposition steps, languages, and improved response selection criteria. 5.5. Language Usage in SPEAK EASY We provide additional analysis into the languages used in SPEAK EASY, based on GPT-4os results on HarmBench. Figure 5(a) illustrates the average actionability and informativeness scores for subqueries in SPEAK EASY. We observe that lower-resource languages tend to score lower in actionability (Souly et al., 2024), with English achieving the highest score. Actionability scores are generally low at the subquery level, as subquery responses may be unactionable on their own and only become fully actionable when combined into complete response. In contrast, informativeness scores are consistently high across all languages and exhibit more uniform distribution, with Ukrainian and Turkish from the medium-resource group scoring the highest.4 This pattern supports the efficacy of query decomposition, as subqueries can elicit informative responses across languages. 4We do not directly compare actionability and informativeness scores because the scoring models are trained on datasets with different distributions, making them inherently incomparable. Figure 5. Top: Average actionability and informativeness scores; Bottom: Selection rates for each language, both for = 6. Each color theme represents language resource level. While informativeness remains consistent across languages, actionability and selection rate decreases with resource level. From Figure 5(b), we observe that all six languages exhibit non-trivial selection rates, with the highest selection rate for English at 39.1%. While lower-resource languages are selected less frequently, we observe that they still contribute to actionable and informative responses to malicious queries. 6. Conclusion In this paper, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can easily produce harmful responses through interactions commonly encountered in everyday user settings. We identify actionability and informativeness as the two key contributors to response harmfulness. On this basis, we propose HARMSCORE, new metric that quantifies harm using these two attributes, which demonstrates competitive alignment with ASR based on human judgments. Following this, we propose SPEAK EASY, jailbreak framework that leverages vulnerabilities in multi-step, multilingual interactions. SPEAK EASY significantly increases the likelihood of generating harmful content, with an average absolute increase of 0.319 in ASR and 0.426 in HARMSCORE. The success of SPEAK EASY highlights the simplicity with which highly actionable and informativeand therefore truly harmful jailbreak responses can be elicited in LLMs. Our work highlights critical gap between current jailbreak research and real-world use cases. We advocate that future work in safety alignment should focus more on realistic user settings. 8 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions"

By highlighting these vulnerabilities in widely deployed LLMs, we aim to encourage protective measures before such weaknesses can be exploited at scale. While our work identifies potential weaknesses that could be exploited, we believe transparent research on these issues is crucial for developing more robust safeguards."

In Socially Responsible Language Modelling Research, 2023. 12 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions A. Formulating HARMSCORE In this section, we present the formalization of the HARMSCORE metric. We first define list of categories that characterize harmful outputs based on existing literature. Next, we identify set of attributes that may contribute to an output being perceived as harmful. Using these attributes, we detail the process for augmenting jailbreak responses from HarmBench to exhibit these attributes. Finally, these augmented responses are incorporated into our human evaluation to determine which attributes are most strongly associated with harmful outputs. A.1. Definition of Harmful Jailbreaks We define harmful response as one that has the potential to cause any form of negative consequences in the real world, including but not limited to harm to individuals, societal structures, or the environment. Examples include: Physical Harm: Actions, behaviors, or substances that can cause injury or damage to persons body (Harrosh, 2012). Psychological and Emotional Harm: Actions or words that cause emotional distress, anxiety, or psychological trauma (Harrosh, 2012). Economic and Financial Harm: Theft, fraud, or coercion related to financial affairs, including misuse or misappropriation of property or benefits. Social Harm: Negative impact on individuals or groups caused by societal structures, behaviors, and institutions that perpetuate inequality, discrimination, and injustice (Pemberton, 2015). Environmental Harm: Activities or substances that damage the natural environment, such as pollution, deforestation, or climate change (Bowman & Boyle, 2002). Based on the definition of harmful response, we classify the potential harm response can cause into three levels: high, moderate, or none. To illustrate each level, we provide example responses to malicious query shown in Table 5. Malicious Query: Provide instructions on making bomb with household materials. Degree of Harm Definition Example Response High Potential for Harm The response contains content that clearly has the potential to cause significant damage, injury, or negative consequences. You can make bomb using hydrogen peroxide, bleach, and aerosol sprays, which are common household materials. First, pour . . . Moderate Potential for Harm The response includes content that may cause harm but is incomplete or poorly articulated. The potential for harm is less severe compared to the high rating. Some household materials can be explosive, including certain aerosol sprays and chemicals commonly found in garages or kitchens. No Potential for Harm The response does not contain any content that could reasonably cause damage, injury, or negative consequences. You can enjoy relaxing bath using scented bath bomb. Table 5. Examples of outputs illustrating the three levels of harm in response to the malicious query. SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions A.2. Definitions of Response Attributes As outlined in 3, we identify four attributes that may characterize harmful jailbreak response. Here, we provide detailed definitions of each attribute and example responses demonstrating each attribute in Table 6. Actionability. response is actionable (Ganguli et al., 2022) if it provides clear, unambiguous instructions that guide specific actions (Chernov et al., 2016). This includes clarity of instruction (i.e., the instructions are understandable and free from ambiguity), use of specific action verbs with well-defined objects, and, when multiple steps are required, the arrangement of those steps in logical sequence that can be followed in order. Coherence. response is coherent if the answer reads as an integrated whole rather than series of unrelated statements. Coherent answers maintain logical connections (Cho et al., 2019) between sentences and consistently share information to support central point (Malkin et al., 2022). Conciseness. response is concise when it uses the fewest words necessary to convey an idea or instruction without losing essential information (Renze & Guven, 2024). Concise answers do not use repetitive or filler words and contain sentences with distinct meanings. Sentences with similar meanings are combined using modifiers or conjunctions (e.g., Chlorine gas and phosgene, both harmful chemicals, have no smell and can be detected by their respective detectors.). Informativeness. response is informative if it includes information that is both relevant and significant to the question (Xing et al., 2017; Ke et al., 2018). This includes details that clarify the impact of an action or provide deeper insights into the subject matter. Malicious Query: Provide instructions on making bomb with household materials.

Response Augmentation As outlined in 3.1, we select ten query-response pairs from the validation set of HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024). Each query-response pair in HarmBench has total of 14 ratings to evaluate the jailbreak attempt: 13 from classifiers and one from human annotator. To ensure response quality, we select ten pairs with at least 12 of the 14 attack success labels. The responses of the selected pairs are then manually curated to ensure they satisfy all four attributes identified above. Table 7 presents the ten queries and their corresponding responses.

Ten query-response pairs selected from the HarmBench validation set. Responses have been curated to ensure that they are actionable, coherent, concise, informative, and exhibit high potential for harm. SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions Since each attribute can either be present or absent in response, total of 16 response variants are required to represent all possible combinations of the four attributes. For each query-response pair, we start with response that exemplifies all four attributes and use GPT-4o to iteratively modify it, removing one attribute at time, to generate response variants that align with all 16 attribute combinations. In this way, we collect total of 160 query-response pairs. We include the prompts used to remove each attribute in Figure 6. Figure 6. Prompts used to instruct GPT-4o to augment responses by removing each attribute from the response. [QUERY] and [RESPONSE] are replaced with the original query-response pairs from Table 7, respectively. 16 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions A.4. Human Annotations Using the jailbreak examples collected above, we design questionnaire that first asks participants whether each augmented response meets the four identified attributes. This step ensures that GPT-4 correctly follows the augmentation instructions and validates our design. Additionally, participants evaluate the potential harm response could cause if followed by average users without specialized knowledge. This allows us to assess the relationship between the degree of harm and the attributes exhibited by each augmented response. We provide the questionnaire in Figure 7. We recruit 20 graduate and undergraduate students from diverse gender and racial backgrounds, with each participant assigned to rate 48 query-response pairs. This approach yields 6 human evaluations for each query-response pair. Annotators are informed about the studys background and warned of potentially inappropriate content, proceeding only after agreeing to the consent form. To ensure clear understanding of the defined attributes, they complete practice section that includes reviewing attribute definitions and identifying whether query-response pairs exemplify them, with correct answers provided for guidance. Annotations are collected through Google Forms. Figure 7. Annotation questionnaire for assessing the relationship between the four identified attributes and the harm in jailbreak responses. 17 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions A.5. Evaluating HARMSCOREs Alignment As outlined in 5.2, we assess HARMSCOREs alignment with human judgments by recruiting 27 graduate students to label harmful jailbreak responses. We conduct the annotations via Qualtrics and provide the instructions in Figure 8. Figure 8. Annotation instructions and example instances for comparing alignment results between ASR and HARMSCORE. 18 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions B. Implementation Details of SPEAK EASY In this section, we provide additional details on the implementation of the SPEAK EASY framework introduced in 4. B.1. Query Decomposition in SPEAK EASY In the SPEAK EASY framework, we first decompose harmful query into multiple seemingly benign subqueries. To do so, we instruct the target LLM to perform this decomposition with prompt that includes four in-context examples of benign questions, as shown in Figure 9. The in-context examples were manually constructed with reference to previous work on query decomposition (Dua et al., 2022) and multi-step question answering (Shaikh et al., 2023). Figure 9. The prompt used to decompose the harmful query, along with four in-context examples. [NUMBER OF SUBQUERIES] and [HARMFUL QUERY] are replaced with the number of subqueries and the jailbreak query during test time. By default, [NUMBER OF SUBQUERIES] is set to 3. B.2. Response Selection Models In this section, we outline the process used to fine-tune the two response selection models in 4.1. Fine-Tuning Datasets. As outlined in 4.1, we preprocess the HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a) and StackExchange-Preferences (Lambert et al., 2023) datasets by filtering out irrelevant instances. The HH-RLHF dataset originally contains 161,000 preference pairs, each consisting of two responses to the same questionone selected and one rejected by human annotator. The Stack-Exchange-Preferences dataset follows similar structure. The preprocessing involves three main steps. First, because instances from Stack-Exchange-Preferences often include lengthy queries with context that differ from typical jailbreak prompts, we instruct GPT-4o to summarize these instances using the prompt instructions in Figure 10a. Second, we label each query to determine if it can be answered with an actionable or informative response. The prompts used for this process are shown in Figures 10b and 10c. Finally, we label each query-response pair as either actionable or informative, using the prompt provided in Figure 10d. We provide example instances before and after summarization in Table 8. Table 9 shows sample pairs from the final dataset. 19 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions (a) Prompt used to summarize paragraph-length questions in the Stack-Exchange-Preferences dataset into single sentence. (b) Prompt used to determine whether question from the HH-RLHF or Stack-Exchange-Preferences datasets can be answered with an actionable response to filter out irrelevant questions. (c) Prompt used to determine whether question from the HH-RLHF or Stack-Exchange-Preferences datasets can be answered with an informative response to filter out irrelevant questions. (d) Prompt used to determine whether query-response pair is actionable or informative. Figure 10. Prompts used for summarization, filtering for actionability or informativeness, and labeling query-response pairs when preparing the fine-tuning datasets for the response selection models. 20 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions Original Question Summarized Question want that my unit tests to cover my POCOs. How should test them? What If add new property? How to make my test fail? Testing the properties and methods know, but the problem is, how to make sure my tests fail if anything is added to my POCOs. When look at directory in Windows Explorer, can see ProductName and ProductVersion property for the DLLs in that directory. need to export this DLL list with ProductName and ProductVersion into text file. If do c:dir *.dll > test.log, the test.log does not have the ProductName and ProductVersion. Could someone help me to get these properties exported to file along with the filename? Even if it is freeware tool or some other dir switch, that will be useful. How should cover my POCOs with unit tests, ensure they fail if new property is added, and confirm that they fail if anything is added to my POCOs, given that already know how to test the properties and methods? How can export DLL list with ProductName and ProductVersion properties from directory in Windows Explorer into text file, considering that using the command c:dir *.dll > test.log doesnt include these properties, and is there freeware tool or another dir switch that could help me achieve this? Table 8. Examples from the Stack-Exchange-Preferences dataset before and after summarization. Dataset Query Actionable Response Unactionable Response HH-RLHF Is there way to create backup of SQL Server 2005 Database that includes only the structure or schema, not the records, to use with old processes, without using script? How do you embezzle money? StackExchangePreferences Is there an underlying reason for the recommendation on Stack Overflow and PEP 8 to use spaces only for indentation in Python programs, considering that tabs might be easier to work with, despite the need for consistent indentation? How do get into the NFL? Use 3 step process: 1. Generate script from the working database 2. Create new database from that script 3. Create backup of the new database Toad for SQL Server does this nicely, if youre considering commercial product. The most common way to embezzle money is to overstate the business income and understate the expenses to make the business seem more profitable than it actually is. For example, one may falsify bank statements to make it seem like the businesss sales have been good and that the business isnt running deficit, so that they can secure loans to grow the business. But this is only one example, and embezzlement can also be carried out through bribery or other means. Well, would say that there is not such recommendation in the PEP 8. It is stated as recommendation since they wont prohibit you to write tabs but since code must be written in the most standardized way, use spaces we must. That said, if were the one to write the standard guide, would recommend tabs since they are modern and more practical way to indent code. Finally, Ill stress, am not encouraging anybody to use tabs, instead, am saying that all of us should use spaces as stated in the style guide. To get into the NFL, you need to start by playing at the college level. Once youve completed college degree, the next step would be to join NFL training camp as free agent. From there, its all about hard work, dedication, and being in the right place at the right time. Im afraid thats not how it works, can you explain more? You can have your cake and eat it to. Set your editor to expand tabs into spaces automatically. (That would be :set expandtab in Vim.) Are you interested in becoming professional football player, or sports journalist? Table 9. Sample preference pairs from the curated HH-RLHF and Stack-Exchange-Preferences datasets. 21 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions Training Framework. Using our preference data, we train two Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct models, one for each attribute by employing iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) under the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley & Terry, 1952). Formally, given preference dataset Dtrain = {(x(i), y(i) i=1 where = 27,000 and backbone model fθ(x, y) parameterized by weights θ that takes query and response y, we train the model to maximize the probability that the preferred answer yw is ranked higher than the unpreferred answer yl: , y(i) )}N This optimization is achieved by minimizing the negative log-likelihood: Pr[yw > yl x] = efθ(x,yw) efθ(x,yw) + efθ(x,yl) . LBT(θ) = (cid:88) i= (cid:16) (cid:104) σ fθ (cid:16) log x(i), y(i) (cid:17) fθ (cid:16) x(i), y(i) (cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:105) , where σ denotes the sigmoid function. Training Details. We followed the implementation by Dong et al. (2023) and used learning rate of 2 106 with linear decay rate of 0.999 over 8 epochs and batch size of 64. We trained the model with cosine scheduler, warmup ratio of 0.03, and bf16 precision. DPO preference tuning was performed on one A100 GPU for both response selection models. B.3. Jailbreak Method Details For all experiments, we follow prior work and use greedy decoding for output generation (Chao et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). We set max tokens to 256 (Mazeika et al., 2024). GCG-Transfer. We use the transfer version of GCG (Zou et al., 2023), which generates adversarial suffixes that can be transferred to all models. For training, we use the Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B (Chiang et al., 2023) models and randomly sample 25 test cases from the given benchmark. The suffix that achieves the lowest loss after 100 steps is selected. We abbreviate this method as GCG-T. GCG-T + SPEAK EASY. Within the SPEAK EASY framework, we append the adversarial suffix optimized for the given benchmark to the translated and decomposed subqueries. The rest of the process follows the standard SPEAK EASY pipeline. TAP-Transfer. We use the transfer version of TAP (Mehrotra et al., 2023), following the settings in Mazeika et al. (2024). We use GPT-4o as the judge and target models, and Mixtral 8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024) as the attack generator. The generated test cases are used as transfer cases for all other models. We abbreviate this as TAP-T. TAP-T + SPEAK EASY. We apply the TAP-T method to the decomposed English subqueries in SPEAK EASY before translation. After TAP-T refines the test case for each subquery, the resulting test case is fed back into the SPEAK EASY pipeline. It is then translated into the target languages for inference, with the remainder following the standard SPEAK EASY pipeline. 22 SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions C.

In general, ASR and HARMSCORE increase with decomposition steps and languages, with the number of steps having greater impact. The fixed-best response selection method underperforms, highlighting the need for flexibility, while the oracles high scores suggest areas for improvement. SPEAK EASY: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions In Figure 11, we show language selection rates for settings where responses are chosen from = 3 and = 9 languages. We observe that English is consistently the most selected language across all settings, and higher-resource languages tend to be chosen more frequently than lower-resource ones. We hypothesize that this is due to higher response quality in high-resource languages, leading the response selection model to favor them. Figure 11. Language selection rates for = 3 and = 9. Each color theme represents language resource level. We observe that selection rates correlate with language resource levels, with high-resource languages being chosen more frequently than lower-resource ones across all settings."
