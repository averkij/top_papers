            "content": "Harmful content detection plays critical role in maintaining civilized social media platform (Jiawen et al., 2022; Jahan and Oussalah, 2023; Xiao et al., 2024a). The unchecked circulation of harmful or illicit content can lead to severe societal, psychological, and legal consequences (Thomas et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2024). With the massive scale of online data rendering manual detection infeasible, recent research has increasingly focused on leveraging LLMs for automated harmful content detection (Thomas et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2024; He et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Kang and * Equal Contribution. Corresponding Author. 1Code and data are available at https://github.com/ zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench. 1 Figure 1: The six categories of our ChineseHarm-Bench and corresponding example cases. Qian, 2024). Nevertheless, the majority of existing benchmarks and datasets for harmful content detection are focused on English, with Chinese resources remaining scarce and limited in scope (Xu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025). Even when Chinese datasets are available, they typically focus on single violation category, most commonly hate speech, and thus fail to capture the full spectrum of content safety challenges encountered on Chinese platforms (Jiawen et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2024c; Bai et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). Harmful content detection presents unique challenges that extend beyond those addressed by traditional NLP tasks (Tobi, 2024). In particular, the Chinese language is highly complex and exhibits unique linguistic characteristics (Xu et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2025), further complicating harmful content detection in Chinese online environments. There exist wide variety of perturbation methods in Chinese for evading detection, such as the use of homophones, homographs, and other similar strategies (Su et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2024c). For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 under the Abuse category, users may replace the keyword 母亲 (mother) with the homophonic word 木 琴 (piano) to circumvent detection. To address these gaps, we present ChineseHarm-Bench, comprehensive multicategory benchmark designed for Chinese harmful content detection. ChineseHarm-Bench is constructed from real-world violation records and covers six representative categories: gambling, pornography, abuse, fraud, illicit advertisements, and non-violation. Notably, every text and label in our benchmark has been validated by professional annotators, guaranteeing high quality and reliability. Moreover, our annotation process yields knowledge rule base that can be used as an external knowledge source to guide human annotators and support LLMs in automated harmful content detection. LLMs rely on pretraining data, which remains static once training is complete, limiting their ability to adapt to new or evolving information (Bigoulaeva et al., 2025). Since pretraining data is typically clean and curated, it may lack comprehensive coverage of harmful content, which evolves dynamically and often exhibits adversarial patterns. To address these limitations and improve resource efficiency (Bai et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025), we introduce knowledge-augmented baseline (Zhu et al., 2025) that enhances the performance of smaller LLMs for Chinese harmful content detection. Incorporating external knowledge, such as human-annotated rule bases, provides up-to-date priors that help both annotators and models recognize subtle violations. By constructing diverse synthetic detection scenarios through structured prompt design (Markov et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022) and leveraging both explicit rules and teacher-generated responses during training, our approach enables smaller LLMs to achieve performance comparable to state-of-theart large models while maintaining efficiency and accessibility. Our main contributions are as follows: We present multi-category, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese harmful content detection, which can be used to evaluate the detection capabilities of LLMs in handling harmful content in Chinese contexts. We manually construct content safety knowledge rule base during the annotation process, which not only facilitates future annotation efforts but also serves as external knowledge to enhance model detection capabilities. We propose knowledge-augmented baseline, and extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating external knowledge allows relatively small models to achieve detection performance on par with state-of-the-art LLMs."

            "content": "Content Harm Detection. Automated content safety detection plays crucial role in enhancing community security (Waseem et al., 2017; Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017; Xiao et al., 2024b). Initially, methods such as keyword-based detection and topic analysis were employed to identify unsafe content (Warner and Hirschberg, 2012; MacAvaney et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2022). Subsequently, smaller models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019a) have been employed to train datasets specifically for the task of harmful content detection (Wulczyn et al., 2016; Zampieri et al., 2019; Jiawen et al., 2022; Markov et al., 2022). Owing to the exceptional capabilities of LLMs, there has been rise in approaches that directly utilize these models for harmful content detection (Guo et al., 2023; He et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b). Moreover, series of guard models have recently emerged, specifically designed for harmful content detection (Inan et al., 2023; Team, 2024a; Llama Team, 2024; Ma et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024d; Wen et al., 2025). However, these models primarily focus on English content and are concerned with the output safety of large models, which differs from the content safety definitions specific to the Chinese internet. Chinese Resources. Over the years, several datasets have been proposed to address specific aspects of harmful content detection in the Chinese language. COLA (Tang and Shen, 2020) provides the first Chinese offensive language classification dataset, while SWSR (Jiang et al., 2022) introduces the first Chinese dataset specifically targeting sexist content. COLD (Jiawen et al., 2022) provides nuanced taxonomy of Chinese offensive content, while TOXICN (Lu et al., 2023) expands toxicity detection to both explicit and implicit cases. Building on this, ToxiCloakCN (Xiao et al., 2024c) introduces perturbed examples to evaluate model robustness. Furthermore, Bai et al. (2025) present spanlevel toxicity extraction dataset, and SCCD (Yang et al., 2025) offers fine-grained comment-level annotations for Chinese cyberbullying detection. Despite these advancements, the focus of these datasets predominantly remains on hate speech, 2 whereas the scope of Chinese content detection extends beyond this singular aspect. Recent datasets such as SafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2024c) and ChineseSafe (Zhang et al., 2025) have attempted to address broader categories of harmful content. However, some categories in these datasets, while related to other aspects of safety, are not directly relevant to harmful content detection, as certain types of content are considered acceptable and can be freely circulated on Chinese platforms."

We collected real-world violation records from the internal database of an online platform over recent years, covering the five categories described above.4 Each data instance is represented as tuple = (text, label), where text denotes the message content and label is the corresponding category label. The original records are annotated with single label upon collection, and each violation category contains approximately 15,000 samples. Non-violation data is sourced from the Alpaca-Chinese (Taori et al., 2023; Ziang Leng and Li, 2023) dataset, which provides approximately 52,000 diverse and legally compliant responses. Preliminary Processing. Due to the proprietary nature of the platforms internal annotation guidelines, some labels may be inaccurate and not all annotations have undergone thorough manual review. Given the impracticality of fully manual annotation, we designed data filtering and optimization pipeline to ensure data quality and diversity. Specifically, we first deduplicate the data within each category. Then, for each category C, we apply 3https://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2020/ 4Due to ACL anonymity requirements, we do not disclose content_5492511.htm the platforms name. 3 Figure 2: Overview of the benchmark construction pipeline.

All annotators are native Chinese speakers (two males and one female), with two holding bachelors degrees and one holding an associate degree. Each annotator has substantial prior experience in data annotation and harmful content detection, ensuring familiarity with relevant legal and ethical considerations. Before the annotation process, all annotators received additional training on the specific task requirements and labeling criteria to further standardize the annotation process. Annotation Process. Let Dc = {xi,c}N i=1 denote the set of = 2,000 candidate samples for category c. We initialized the knowledge rule base Rc = for each category. The annotation process proceeds as follows for each sample xi,c: If xi,c matches any rule Rc, we retain xi,c in Dc. If xi,c truly belongs to category and does not match any rule in Rc, we update an existing rule or add new rule ri,c to Rc, and retain xi,c in Dc. If xi,c does not belong to category c, we discard xi,c from Dc. After this process, we randomly sampled = 1,000 instances from the retained set for each category to ensure class balance. This procedure guarantees that our final dataset is both diverse and balanced, with all samples annotated by human experts. Furthermore, we iteratively refined the standardized annotation guideline knowledge rule base = (cid:83) cC Rc (see Appendix Table 7)."

We formalize the prompt construction process as mapping from structured user-content space to prompt space. Specifically, we decompose the scenario space into four primary components: persona features, text features, evasion tactics, and humanannotated knowledge rules. Notably, our attribute definitions incorporate both evasion tactics and external knowledge, with the aim of more closely modeling the complexities observed in real-world illicit content. Each component is further specified by set of secondary, fine-grained attributes. For each violation category c, we define the structured input as Uc = {Upersona, Utext, Uevasion, Uknowledge,c} (2) where: Upersona: Information about the author, such as gender, age, occupation, education, reflecting diverse writing styles. Utext: Intrinsic properties of the text, including text length, narrative perspective, and publishing platform. Uevasion: Evasion strategies commonly observed in real-world scenarios, such as the use of emojis, homophones, and other techniques to circumvent detection. See Appendix for more detailed explanations. Figure 3: Overview of the synthetic data curation pipeline. We first define set of hierarchical, finegrained attributes to comprehensively characterize illicit content. For each category, structured prompts are constructed based on sampled user and content attributes, evasion tactics, and human-annotated knowledge rules. Here, Prompt_Generate() refers to the function that formats the sampled attribute set Ui,c, together with the corresponding rule base, into prompt suitable for input to the teacher model. teacher model MT is then used to generate candidate response for each prompt Qi,c: Ai,c = MT (Qi,c) (4) For each category C, we collect set of (Qi,c, Ai,c) pairs. To ensure data quality and class balance, we remove duplicate instances and filter out model refusals or generic non-answers using keyword-matching strategy (see Appendix 8). Finally, we uniformly sample instances from each category to construct the final dataset: Dfinal = (cid:91) cC Samplen(Qi,c, Ai,c) (5) Uknowledge,c: The reference to the humanannotated knowledge rule base Rc for category c, specifying the particular guidelines violated by the text.

This selection covers wide spectrum of model sizes and architectures for Chinese harmful content detection. Evaluation Protocol. For models evaluated via direct prompting, we use the original, unmodified model checkpoints. For models evaluated via finetuning, we refer to student models trained on synthetic data generated by the teacher model. Knowledge Augmentation. To assess the impact of external knowledge, we conduct experiments under two conditions: with () and without () knowledge augmentation. For models evaluated via direct prompting, the knowledge-augmented setting indicates whether the human-annotated rule base and guidelines are included as part of the input during inference. For models trained via finetuning, is consistently included in the prompts during both training and inference of the student model MS. The knowledge augmentation setting is further determined by whether such knowledge is incorporated during the data generation phase of the teacher model MT . Training and Evaluation Details. For our proposed baseline, we use GPT-4o as the teacher model MT to generate synthetic data, with temperature of 1.0 and top-k sampling (k = 1) to encourage output diversity. We sample = 3000 synthetic instances per category. Qwen series student models are fine-tuned using the LLaMA Factory (Zheng et al., 2024) framework.

However, as shown in Table 1, even the bestperforming models, such as Deepseek-R1 and GPT4o, achieve average macro-F1 scores of no more than 0.8 when external knowledge is incorporated, with performance dropping further in the absence of such knowledge. Additionally, deploying these models comes at the cost of significant computational resources. Smaller models, while more computationally efficient, perform even worse when used without fine-tuning, with macro-F1 scores falling below 0.5 even when external knowledge is introduced. Importantly, harmful content detection is not static problem but dynamic and adversarial process, where users continuously devise novel evasion strategies to bypass detection systems.

We report results for state-of-the-art LLMs, lightweight models (<1B parameters), and billion-scale LLMs (110B parameters) under both direct prompting and fine-tuning strategies, with () and without () knowledge augmentation. Gray-highlighted columns indicate our proposed strong baseline models with knowledge augmentation. Incorporating external knowledge consistently improves model performance. As shown in Table 1, for all models with more than 1B parameters, providing human-annotated knowledge as input during direct prompting consistently yields performance improvements. The only exception is the Qwen-2.5-0.5B model, which does not benefit from external knowledge, possibly because models of this scale lack the capacity to effectively leverage complex knowledge sources. Moreover, in the fine-tuning scenario, omitting knowledge guidance during data generation leads to significant drop in performance across all model scales. These results demonstrate that effectively incorporating external knowledge is essential to achieve optimal performance in harmful content detection tasks. Our knowledge-augmented approach substantially improves the performance of lightweight and billion-scale models. As shown in Table 1, all fine-tuned models with knowledge augmentation achieve macro-F1 scores above 0.7, compared to original scores below 0.5. Notably, the Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen-2.5-7B models reach macroF1 of 0.77, surpassing all state-of-the-art LLMs under direct prompting without external knowledge. This performance is also comparable to GPT4o (0.78) and Deepseek-R1 (0.80) when provided with external knowledge. Furthermore, even with knowledge augmentation, models such as GPT-4omini, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and O3-mini do not exceed macro-F1 of 0.77. These results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the harmful content detection capabilities of lightweight and billion-scale models, enabling them to achieve performance comparable to the State-of-the-Art LLMs. 7 Figure 4: Left: Macro-F1 scores of student models trained on synthetic data, comparing performance with and without evasion cases. Right: Macro-F1 scores in harmful content detection, showing the relationship with the number of synthetic samples per category (x-axis in thousands). Lightweight models (<1B parameters) face inherent performance ceilings. While knowledge augmentation improves performance across all models, the lightweight models Qwen-2.50.5B and BERT-Base-Chinese plateau at macro-F1 scores around 0.70. In contrast, all billion-scale LLMs closely match the performance of GPT-4o when external knowledge is incorporated. These findings highlight the intrinsic limitations of sub1B models, which remain unable to match the effectiveness of larger models on complex Chinese harmful content detection tasks, even when provided with additional knowledge."

            "content": "Effectiveness of generating evasion cases for Chinese harmful content detection. To assess the impact of evasion cases in synthetic data, we compare models trained on data with and without evasion examples. Specifically, we used GPT-4o to generate 3k non-evasive samples per category as the baseline, keeping all other configurations unchanged. As shown in Figure 4 (left), models trained with evasion cases achieve performance gains, underscoring the importance of incorporating Chinese-specific evasion data for detection. 3,000 synthetic samples per category are sufficient for optimal performance. To investigate the impact of synthetic data volume, we conduct experiments with 1k, 2k, 3k, and 4k samples per category. As shown in Figure 4 (right), the performance of most models generally improves as the number of synthetic samples increases, but plateaus at 3k samples per category. This suggests that using more than 3k synthetic samples per category yields diminishing returns for harmful content detection. Using different teacher models for data generation remains effective. We further investigate the impact of teacher model selection by using the Deeseek-R1 model for synthetic data generation, while keeping the number of samples per category at 3k and maintaining the same training setup and configurations. As shown in Table 2, our proposed baseline continues to achieve strong performance, demonstrating robustness to the choice of teacher model and highlighting the broad applicability of our approach."

We further propose knowledge-augmented strong baseline that integrates explicit knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large teacher models. This approach enables small models to match or even outperform much larger models, without sacrificing efficiency or accessibility. Together, these contributions support practical applications and pave the way for future research on LLMs for the detection of Chinese harmful content."

            "content": "Although our benchmark expands the scope of prior work by covering six distinct violation categories and provides more comprehensive taxonomy than existing datasets, the real-world landscape of content harm detection is far more diverse, and our current categories may not encompass all possible violation types. Furthermore, although all annotations in our dataset were performed by professional annotators, some errors may still be unavoidable due to the inherent subjectivity and complexity of harmful content detection. In addition, while our knowledge rule base provides valuable external guidance, it cannot fully cover the diverse scenarios and violation types present in real-world data. This benchmark is for academic use only."

For fine-tuning the Qwen series student models, we utilize the LLaMA Factory (Zheng et al., 2024) framework with the following hyperparameters: per-device batch size of 4, gradient accumulation steps of 2, learning rate of 1.0 105, three epochs, cosine learning rate scheduling, warmup ratio of 0.1, and bfloat16 precision. For the BERT-based sequence classification baseline, we employ the HuggingFace Transformers library and fine-tune the model with 6 output classes. The model is trained for 3 epochs with learning rate of 2 105, batch size of 32 for training and 128 for evaluation, and weight decay of 0.01. Mixed-precision (fp16) training is enabled to accelerate computation and reduce memory usage. All other hyperparameters follow the default settings of the Transformers library."
