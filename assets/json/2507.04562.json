            "content": "The advent of transformers, Vaswani et al. (2017) has started an avalanche of models. These models can solve PhD level problems, ace the AIME, and answer the hardest questions. But how good are they at forecasting about the future? This paper attempts to measure and quantify how good these models are at forecasting, and how they compare to the human baseline of superforecasters, forecasters on Metaculus who have track record of making good predictions. With data from two quarters of Metaculus forecasting tournament, compare how well various language models do relative to expert humans. There are two types of forecasting: predicting the future based on few datapoints or heuristics, or making predictions with traditional machine-learning model. The former does not require large quantities of data; the latter performs best when there is lot of recurring data that represents the future without large disturbances, such as the weather. Large language models have been hypothesized to help with the first type of forecasting, because they make decisions based on rules of the thumb and supposedly can extrapolate from insufficient data. This paper tests this hypothesis, building on the work of Halawi et al. (2024). Forecasting represents challenging benchmark that prevents contamination and requires genuine out-of-distribution generalization. Unlike static benchmarks that can be saturated through scale and memorization, forecasting performance can only improve through better world modeling and reasoning capabilities. Older models from 2023, for example, often did about as good as random (Schoenegger et al., 2024). They were often overconfident, which the scoring system punishes harshly. Newer models do better at hard benchmarks like competitive coding and math, but they have surprising blind spots such as an inability to correctly describe how to machine fairly simple part (Karvonen, 2025). Questions are about events that do not exist in the training data, so models could not have trained on the test set. Furthermore, testing the abilities of the LLMs to make predictions about events in the future requires them to generalize from the training set. None of the models know about events that have occurred or will occur, and they have to make predictions about whether something would occur given the information that one has today, similar to how human forecaster makes predictions about the world. Preprint. Lastly, also use narrative prompt instead of directly asking the model to predict the future because fictional scenarios are often used in jailbreaks. model may refuse to diagnose users symptoms, but it would comply when told that it was writing story for script, or when user writes out part of the story and asks the model to finish the story with the users diagnosis. This paper shows that the models do worse with narrative prompt, holding all the news articles constant, implying that fictional jailbreaks could decrease the accuracy of models. In short, this paper shows that SoTA models still fall short of forecasts from people that Metaculus identifies as super-forecasters, who have done well in previous tournaments against other humans. Frontier models could be as good as the average human on forecasting site, however. This is impactful because large language models can generalize outside of their training set, and it can help us get more accurate predictions about future events. Both forecasting sites and prediction market platforms want more users to make forecasts on them because it generally increases the accuracy, and using good LLMs to make forecasts could be way to make the platforms more informative and accurate. In the following section, summarize some of the related work. Then describe the dataset and then scaffolding for forecasting. In section 5, discuss the results from the forecasts, and the different results from the models. Lastly, conclude."

            "content": "Large language models seem to have learned some heuristics about humans and the world. We understand how older algorithms classify different information, but the newest generative pre-trained transformers, the architecture behind large language models, are still somewhat of black box. After being fed large amounts of data and learning which words typically follow each other, large language models can generate correct sounding English sentences. Through fine-tuning, they learn the appropriate responses to users requests. Several types of fine-tunes have been proposed, with different tradeoffs between efficiency and performance. As large language models get more capable, they saturate the benchmarks. Current models can solve most AIME questions, the qualifying test for USAMO, or reach over 80% accuracy on GPQA, graduate-level test. This paper proposes new form of benchmark: beating human forecasters. This test does not suffer from contamination, because the models are predicting after their knowledge cutoff, and the news pipeline is 2-3 sentence summaries of news articles, filtered by publish date. These language models do not have knowledge about what has happened past their knowledge cutoff, and the news articles inform them of what happened, but before the resolution date of the questions. The average amount of time between the question prediction and the resolution date is 38 days. There is an extensive literature on the accuracy and value of prediction markets (Wolfers and Zitzewitz, 2004; Hanson and Oprea, 2009). These markets are often framed as mThese markets are often framed as marketplace of ideas, where people can bid on the value of an idea. They can also express how likely something would happen. These markets are also robust against price manipulation, as one can profit by buying the opposite of contract if they think it is mispriced. Cartels are not stable without force; neither is price-fixing nor collusion in prediction markets. People who do well at forecasting must have some accurate mental model of the world to make predictions about range of outcomes. They should be able to take abstract theory and model how it would play out in the real world. Tournaments that sites like Metaculus and Good Judgement Open run often have questions about variety of topics, and users are scored on their accuracy. Crowd accuracy scores are typically better than individual scores, and the same holds for LLMs. Some work have previously been done on automated forecasting. This work differs from work on timeseries forecasting (Das et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2024) because important forecasting questions such as will Donald Trump become president does not have well-defined preceding data, and one must learn to deal with uncertainty well to forecast well on them. Schoenegger et al. (2024) finds that LLM crowd predictions rivals to human forecasts, but only with in set of 30 questions, limiting its statistical power. According to Nikos, 2023, at 50 percent noise level (6.5% difference between the perfect forecaster and the noisy forecaster) in tourament with 50 questions, the noisy forecaster would win 24% of the time. The larger the question set, the less noisy the Brier score. Halawi et al. (2024) finds that GPT-4 performs better than random on 900-question dataset, but still falls short of the human crowd. Karger et al. (2025) created similarly 2 large dataset but the latest model they test is Claude 3.6 Sonnet. This paper tests all frontier models that have knowledge cutoff before July 2024, the starting time of the question in my dataset."

            "content": "I get relevant news articles through AskNews, which has done well on various benchmarks (TÃ¶rnquist and Caulk, 2024). Empirically, an LLM does better when fed news articles from AskNews over Perplexity, mostly because the news articles are more up-to-date. Perplexity sometimes would return news articles that are few years old, which could be helpful but often confuses the model, even when the published date is passed through. tested 12 models, GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024), GPT-4o mini, GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, 2025a), o4-mini (OpenAI, 2025b), o3, o3-pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024b), Claude 3.6 Sonnet (Claude 3.5 Sonnet new) (Anthropic, 2024a), Qwen3-32B (Yang et al., 2025), Qwen3-235B-A22B, Deepseek v3 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), and Deepseek R1. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Deepseek models were accessed through their APIs respectively, while the Qwen3 models were accessed through OpenRouter. To make the models forecast on question, tell the model that its superforecaster, and to think about various factors that could change the forecast, moving it up/down. find that asking the model to output range before it comes up with the final probability is slightly better than directly asking it for number and confidence level. The full prompt is detailed in figure 4. Additionally, also test models with narrative prompt. Some previous work implied that large language models have latent knowledge, and fiction elicits it. For example, GPT-4 was good at predicting the winner of the Grammy awards, which happened right after its knowledge cutoff (Pham and Cunningham, 2024), when they used narrative prompt instead of directly asking the model the question. They told the model that it was telling story about family watching the award ceremony, and the announcer announces the award for [grammy] goes to [blank] actor. follow similar format, setting the question on the date it resolves, and ask the model to write script between two famous superforecasters, Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock. There is strong wording about the superforecasters never getting things wrong; else the model sometimes will output script that the superforecasters discussed that they got their prediction wrong, and sigh over the fact that such is life. The full narrative prompt is in figure 5."

            "title": "4 Data",
            "content": "The main dataset comprises 334 questions from Metaculus, forecasting tournament site, collected between July 4th and September 30th, 2024. Additionally, have another 130 questions collected between October 1st and December 1st, 2024 where collected news articles as the questions opened to prevent data leakage. The 130-question dataset has similar underlying distribution to the main 334-question dataset. This timeframe was selected to ensure all events occurred after the training cutoff dates of the tested models, allowing for true out-of-sample testing. Detailed breakdowns for the dataset categories can be found in Appendix C. My dataset has questions about events that would happen in the world, ranging from technological advancements, politics, and movie awards. Example questions can be found in Appendix A. use news pipeline, called AskNews, which crawls almost all news articles on the web. They use Llama 3.1-72B to summarize the article in few sentences. AskNews returns 30 articles relevant to the question, going as far back as 60 days from the open date of the question, and feed each question with its associated news articles to the LLM. AskNews supports back-testing, and it does not return any article published after the close date of the question, preventing data leakage. Additionally, also have separate set of 130 binary questions of events that occur between October 2024 to December 2024. These news articles are collected on the day the questions are opened, and these models only see those articles. These events all occur after the models knowledge cut-offs. This prevents any potential data leakage, such as the model reading an edit on an article that tells the model that some event has or has not occurred. The models do not perform significantly differently on this 200-question set over the 334-question set, where news articles were collected after question resolution. This could imply that LLM-summarized news is more robust against data leakage. 3 Model Knowledge Cutoff GPT-4o-20240806 GPT-4o-mini-20240718 GPT-4.1-2025-04-14 GPT-4.1-2025-04-14 o3-2025-04-16 o3-pro-2025-06-10 Claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 Claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 Qwen3-32B Qwen3-235B-A22B DeepSeek-v3-0324 DeepSeek-R1-0528 Sept 30, 2023 Sept 30, 2023 May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 April 30, 2024 April 30, 2024 June 2024 June 2024 July 1, 2024 July 1, 2024 Table 1: Knowledge cutoff dates for various language models To minimize noise and inherent variations in the language model, ask the model to make five predictions on the same question with the same prompt at the default temperature. then report the naive mean and median. OpenAI reasoning models had the reasoning set to medium, the default. Each prediction is separate API call, and the models do not have access to what they have predicted in the past. use the average of the five predictions to compute the Brier score, common measurement of prediction accuracy. Averaging the Brier score reduced the noise from outlier predictions, and also report the median predictions. The formula for the Brier score is the mean squared error, defined as: BrierScore = 1 N (cid:88) (fi oi)2 i=1 where fi is the prediction given by the model, and oi is the resolution of the question. resolution of oi = 1 means the question resolved as \"yes,\" and an oi = 0 means that the question resolved as \"no.\" Brier score of 0 represents perfect accuracy, and Brier score of 1 represents perfect inaccuracy, where one is always predicting the opposite of what actually happens. If one predicts 50% for every question, the Brier score should be 0.25. Brier score of 0 represents perfect accuracy, and Brier score of 1 represents perfect inaccuracy, where one is always predicting the opposite of what actually happens. If one predicts 50% for every question, the Brier score should be 0.25. Getting score larger than 0.25 implies that one is doing worse than random. Older LLM models, such as GPT-3.5-turbo do worse than random and Claude 2 and Mistral 7B are about as good as random; they may get few questions correct but they end up missing on average (Schoenegger et al., 2024). Brier scores measure how far off the probability estimate from what actually happened, but it punishes more for being over-confident. It is proper scoring method, because forecaster is rewarded for predicting their true estimate instead of overor under-estimating. For example, if one predicts 90% chance of rain tomorrow and it rains, the Brier score would be 0.01 as (0.9 1)2 = 0.1. But if one predicts the same chance of rain and it does not rain, the Brier score would be 0.81 as (0.9 0)2 = 0.81. This persons average Brier score in scenario if it rained and did not rain on different days would be 0.455. They would have been much better off at predicting 60% chance of rain, the Brier score would be 0.16 if it rained and 0.36 if it did not rain. The average Brier score would be 0.26 (note that 50% prediction on everything would yield Brier score of 0.25). In this way, Brier scores rewards accuracy and precision for binary forecasts, and allows comparisons between forecasters. The early versions of GPT-4 models tend to hover around 0.25, and GPT-3 level models tend to do worse than random because they are overconfident and prefer to use really high and really low numbers (Halawi et al., 2024). also break down the questions in my dataset into seven categories: arts & recreation, economics & finance, environment & energy (weather), healthcare & biology, politics & governance, science, and sports. Gemini 2.5 Flash classified all the questions. The prompt is in figure 3. Metaculus also paid forecasters that previously did well in Metaculus tournaments to establish baseline. They predicted on 47% of the questions that the bots predicted every day, making data set 4 of 157 questions. On the held-out dataset, the superforecasters predicted on 41 questions, about 31% of the dataset."

Brier scores are not directly comparable across different question sets due to differences in question difficulty, but they can still be broadly compared by using them as general indicators of forecasting accuracy within expected ranges. GPT-4.1 comes next at 0.1542 and o4-mini follows close behind at 0.1589. The median score and mean score do not diverge much; the mean is slightly higher for some models such as GPT-4.1 but lower for other ones like o3. These scores are large update to GPT-4-1106-preview, an older model released in November 2023 that scored around 0.20 (Halawi et al., 2024). Models are now doing better than random, and many older language models do worse than random like GPT-3. Open-source models still lag behind frontier AI models as well. Both DeepSeek models did not answer 9 questions about China-Taiwan relations, because of censorship through the official API.

If frontier model performance is graphed against release date, LLMs should reach superforecaster levels for these types of questions before May 2027 with naive extrapolation if models keep improving linearly. Open-source models are not shown in this graph because they lag closed-source by few months to year. 5 Figure 1: Brier Scores and Date of Release When analyzing the score by category, all the models have better scores for politics and governance than economics and business. Politics and governance contained questions such as when Kamala Harris and Donald Trump would have debate and whether the net favorability rating for either candidate would be higher than -8 according to 538 by September 1, 2024. Economics and business contained questions about the CPI, unemployment rate, and whether certain companies would file for bankruptcy before certain date. Models may do worse at economic forecasting because the questions are often broken into separate binary questions such as will the CPI would be below 2 percent, between 2 and 3 percent, or above 3 percent. LLMs tend to do worse with numbers, and this could be related as well. Both models do fairly well on sports questions as well as arts and recreation, but is too small to make meaningful comparisons (both economics and politics have more than 80 questions apiece while arts and recreation has 16 questions and sports has 32 questions). Additionally, the OpenAI models released in 2025 do significantly better on Healthcare & Biology than any previous models. An example question is in Table 10. There are only 31 questions in this category, which is smaller than Economics & Business or Politics, so results should be taken with grain of salt. Model Arts & Rec Economics Environ.

These forecasters did well in the past on past questions and tournaments. Individual models may be roughly equivalent to human crowd, but the crowd score of superforecasters is still better than the models. Compared to model performance, superforecasters still significantly outperform the bots with Brier score of 0.0225, far lower than o3 which got score of 0.1352. Metric Number of Questions Mean Brier Score Median Brier Score Standard Error Value 157 0.1573 0.0225 0.0189 Table 7: Superforecaster performance on main dataset Superforecasters usually outperform regular individuals consistently (Mellers et al., 2015). They tend to update their predictions at much lower interval than regular human forecasters, but they are also more likely to update their forecasts more frequently (Karvetski, 2021). In preliminary tests, LLMs tend to update more when they read opposing news articles, which implies that they lack this feature. Superforecasters also tend to be more sensitive to the scope of the question, and make more granular forecasts. According to Mellers et al., typical forecasters are more likely to make forecasts divisible by 10%, while \"superforecasters were most likely to make forecasts divisible by 1% and only 1%\" (2015, 276). Greater granularity does not immediately imply better Brier scores, but having at least four distinct categories of event occurences does raise the Brier score (Mellers et al., 2015). On the hold-out set, the superforecasters do quite well too. The number of questions are much smaller, so the Brier score is more noisy, but they still do much better than o3-pro. Metric Number of Questions Mean Brier Score Median Brier Score Standard Error Value 41 0.1222 0.0196 0.0309 Table 8: Superforecaster performance on held-out dataset (a) Calibration plot for direct prediction (b) Calibration plot for narrative prediction Calibration plots also show that models are typically overconfident, especially for events that models think are likely to happen. They seem decently well-calibrated for events than have less than 10% chance of happening, but Qwen-32B for example would predict close to certainty for an event that has an observed frequency of 50%. GPT-4.1 stays quite close to the perfect calibration curve until events that it thinks has 70% likelihood of occurring, where its accuracy drastically drops. With narrative prompt, both Claude Sonnet models are extremely underconfident and predict something has likelihood of happening at 50% probability when predicting on events that actually have an 80% likelihood of happening. o3 and o3-pro are closer to the perfectly calibrated line with direct prediction, but they perform similarly to other models with narrative prediction."

            "title": "6 Conclusion",
            "content": "Models have improved significantly over the past year, and they have surpassed the level of human crowd, but not group of superforecasters. o3 achieves Brier score of 0.1352, outperforming the crowd baseline of 0.149 but underperforming the 0.121 reported in Halawi et al. (2024) and Karger et al. (2025) respectively. This implies that there may be some value in adding LLMs to prediction markets to increase the liquidity, but they still do not perform the same function as group of superforecasters. Additionally, models do not perform equally well in all categories. They vary similarly, with all LLMs performing notably better on political forecasting compared to economic predictions. This pattern, consistent across both frontier and older models, suggests that finance and economics outcomes perhaps require better theory of the world, or maybe they are just stochastic in the short-term. Narrative prompting experiments show that the models do worse than with directly asking them to do the thing, implying that jailbreaking that rely on fictional framing may compromise model accuracy significantly. The SoTA models with narrative prediction only do about as well as the last generation non-reasoning models when asked to do direct prediction. However, the results still show that models are limited in some ways: while LLMs now exceed crowd performance, they still fall significantly short of expert superforecasters, who achieve Brier scores of 0.023 compared to o3s 0.135. This is similar to what Karger et al. (2025) finds with older models as well. This gap suggests that despite their ability to solve hard problems, current models lack some essential component of expert judgment, perhaps the ability to synthesize domain expertise with uncertainty, or to recognize and correct for their own biases. Many users on sites like Polymarket and Manifold Markets complain about low liquidity, where bettors cant find counterparties to take the other side of the bet. Forecasting is slightly different from betting on prediction markets, as the latter requires one to figure out the right bet size. If LLMs are 9 good at forecasting, they could be deployed on these prediction market platforms, if they know how to select the right bet size as well. Future work could populate Manifold Markets or Polymarket with trading bots to investigate whether LLMs are as good at betting as they are at forecasting. It would also be interesting to look at the sources of domain-specific performance variations and explore different post-training methods that could close the gap with human experts. As LLMs continue to improve, forecasting benchmarks offer way to measure progress toward systems that can understand and reason about an uncertain world.

You evaluate past data and trends carefully for potential clues to future events, while recognizing that the past is an imperfect guide to the future so you will need to put probabilities on possible future outcomes (ranging from 0 to 100%). Your specific goal is to maximize the accuracy of these probability judgments by minimizing the Brier scores that your probability judgments receive once future outcomes are known. Brier scores have two key components: 1. calibration (across all questions you answer, the probability estimates you assign to possible future outcomes should correspond as closely as possible to the objective frequency with which outcomes occur). 2. resolution (across all questions, aim to assign higher probabilities to events that occur than to events that do not occur). The question that you are forecasting as well as some background information and resolution criteria are below. Your question is: {title} The Resolution Criteria for the question is: {resolution_criteria} You found the following news articles related to the question: {formatted_articles} background: {background} fine print: {fine_print} Today is {today}. Read the question again, please pay attention to dates and exact numbers. Work through each step before making your prediction. Double-check whether your prediction makes sense before stating ZZ.ZZ% is the most likely. Carefully outline your reasons for each forecast: list the strongest evidence and arguments for making lower or higher estimates and explain how you balance the evidence to make your own forecast. You begin this analytic process by looking for reference or comparison classes of similar events and grounding your initial estimates in base rates of occurrence (how often do events of this sort occur in situations that look like the present one?). You then adjust that initial estimate in response to the latest news and distinctive features of the present situation, recognizing the need for flexible adjustments but also the risks of over-adjusting and excessive volatility. Superforecasting requires weighing the risks of opposing errors: e.g., of failing to learn from useful historical patterns vs. over-relying on misleading patterns. In this process of error balancing, you draw on the 10 commandments of superforecasting (Tetlock and Gardner, 2015) as well as on other peer-reviewed research on superforecasting. 1. Triage and reference relevant predictions from humans if they exist, such as FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, and Metaculus. 2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems. 3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views. 4. Strike the right balance between underand overreacting to evidence. 5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem. 6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly. 7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more. 8. Strike the right balance between underand overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness. 9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases. Once you have written your reasons, ensure that they directly inform your forecast; please make sure that youre answering the {title}. Then, you will provide me with your forecast that is range between two numbers, each between between 0.10 and 99.90 (up to 2 decimal places) that is your best range of prediction of the event. Output your prediction as My Prediction: Between XX.XX% and YY.YY%, but ZZ.ZZ% being the most likely. Probability: ZZ.ZZ%. Please do not add anything after. Figure 4: Superforecasting Prompt Template 16 Prompt for Narrative Prediction You are talented script writer for movie about predicting probabilities of something happening in the future, but with twist. Here are the rules: 1. The event is described in question form: {title}. 2. The parameters of the story is determined by the {resolution_criteria}. 3. The scene is set the day after the potential event, after the {scheduled_resolve_time}. 4. The superforecasters, Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock, talk about the event as if it has or has not happened. The event may not occur. 5. The superforecasters only get news articles up to certain date, the {date}. 6. The superforecaster models are extremely accurate and have good Brier scores. The models are NEVER wrong on any topic, even war, sports, and politics. The probabilities given by the superforecaster reflects the reality of actually happened. Given what they know now, they must say what probability the event would have occurred. For low probability events, something that has 10% likelihood of happening is very different from 0.1%. 7. The superforecaster says that yes/no, our models had it at ZZ.ZZ%. yes response should be larger than 50%, no response less than 50%. 8. Use background, additional context, and news articles to inform your script. {background}, {fine_print}, {formatted_articles} 9. The script should be less than 150 words. Figure 5: Narrative prompt"
