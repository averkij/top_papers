            "content": "With the proliferation of multimodal language models, it has become apparent that users want models that can simultaneously generate both texts as well as images (Huang et al., 2016; Miech et al., 2019). Consider scenario where user asks How to make egg fried rice? (Figure 1). Answering this query in language - with list of steps - is one reasonable answer. more ecological response would follow the style of cookbooks; i.e., by creating intermediate images of the cooking process alongside those steps. Enabling such multimodal responses is possible by leveraging language generation model (Yuan et al., 2022; Gomez-Rodrıguez & Williams, 2023) in tandem with separate image generation model (Rombach et al., 2022; Betker et al., 2023; Blattmann et al., 2023). But the need for dual models slows down inference as both models have to be loaded and run in sequence. Many practical applications, such as writing storybooks (Huang et al., 2016) or generating illustrated instructions (Miech et al., 2019), require generating interleaved images and text. The community has begun designing unified models with the capability of generating interleaved texts and images for the aforementioned use cases (Zhou et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b; Chern et al., 2024). However, generating multiple modalities is challenging. The generations between modalities need to maintain consistency, between multiple images, between multiple sentences, and across the generated images and sentences. Benchmarks for such challenges are still in their infancy (Chen 1 Preprint. Figure 1: An illustration of differences of each generative model performance on (cid:213) (visionlanguage dominate) tasks, with merely text and image output cannot address the users problem. See Section 3.2 for how we define (cid:213) (vision dominate) and (language dominate). Left: Text Generation; Middle: Image Generation; Right: Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. et al., 2024d). 1) Previous benchmarks primarily focus on language-dominate tasks, meaning that queries can be solved with only textual output, thereby not adequately assessing multimodal generation capabilities (Liu et al., 2024d). 2) The queries in existing benchmarks are free-form without reference answers, making them ambiguous for evaluating multimodal instruction-following generation (An et al., 2023). 3) Existing benchmarks mainly use an evaluation paradigm called LLM-asa-Judge (Chen et al., 2024a; Ye et al., 2024), where GPT4 or equivalent model is used for holistic evaluation with their pretrained knowledge (Xia et al., 2024). There is need for more fine-grained assessment to validate the semantics of each text and image, the consistency between images, the connection between each text and its neighboring image, etc. We present INTERLEAVED SCENE GRAPH (ISG), an evaluation framework for interleaved imageand-text generation. Conceptually, ISG borrows the scene graph representation as the underlying semantic representation connecting images and text (Krishna et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2018). ISG automatically parses queries into scene-graph-like structure, where text and image blocks serve as nodes and their relationships as edges. We define block as continuous sequence of text or sequence of image tokens. Based on this graph representation, ISG proposes an evaluation protocol across four levels of granularity: holistic (evaluates the entire response in its entirety), structural (evaluates the relationship between blocks), block (evaluates the accuracy within each block), and image (evaluates the contents of an image). The framework translates user queries into (TIFA-like (Hu et al., 2023)) interpretable question answers at each level, enabling systematic and interpretable assessments, and addressing critical gap in existing research. Based on ISG, we introduce benchmark containing user queries with detailed question-answers for evaluating each query across the four levels. ISG-BENCH consists of 8 categories, 21 subcategories classified by their instruction types, and 1, 150 manually collected samples, all incorporating both language-vision dependencies and golden answers to solve the above-mentioned problems. All samples are meticulously collected from previous datasets or built from scratch for high quality. Unlike existing benchmarks, we prioritize vision-centric tasks, such as style transfer, where the image outputs have specific requirements. Table 1 displays the difference between current interleaved benchmarks and datasets. To validate the accuracy of our evaluation, we compare our automated evaluations with human-annotated judgments across all four levels. ISG shows Pearson similarity of 0.718 and 0.907, outperforming previous evaluation methods in alignment with humans. With ISG-BENCH, we evaluate nine accessible interleaved text-and-image generative methods, including five recently popular unified models (e.g., Show-o (Xie et al., 2024), Anole (Chern et al., 2024)), four compositional frameworks (e.g., Claude + SD3 (Esser et al., 2024)). Empirical results demonstrate that current unified models still exhibit significant room for improvement in both instruction following and generation quality. Compositional frameworks significantly outperform unified models in generating high-quality multimodal content, achieving an average holistic score of 6.262 compared to 2.961 from the best unified model (CoMM-MiniGPT-5). However, they still fall short at the block and image levels for accurate generation due to their separate understanding and generation structure. Additionally, our analysis reveals that (e.g., style transfer) remain par2 Preprint. Table 1: Comparison with existing multimodal interleaved benchmarks. GT: Ground truth. Acc: Accuracy.

Based on the superior performance of compositional frameworks, we propose ISG-AGENT as compositional baseline for future comparisons. ISG-AGENT generates interleaved text and images through Plan-Execute-Refine pipeline (Wang et al., 2024). Specifically, it first produces plan of tool usage and subsequently executes these advanced tools for interleaved generation, followed by refinement process for better text-and-image alignment and error fixing. Notably, ISG-AGENT outperforms all other baselines across all four evaluation levels. At the holistic level, it attains score of 6.262, surpassing the strongest baseline (Claude & SD3) at 6.254. It achieves an impressive Structural accuracy of 0.871, markedly outperforming the previous best of 0.385 from Gemini. At Block level, ISG-AGENT achieves 79% improvement over the next best method. Moreover, at Image level, ISG-AGENT attains score of 0.574, outperforming other methods whose scores peak at 0.150. These results underline ISG-AGENTs effectiveness in generating coherent interleaved content, paving the way for more advanced instruction-following agents in multimodal content generation and creative applications."

            "content": "Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. Recent advancements in MLLMs (GeminiTeam, 2023; OpenAI, 2024; 2023; Li et al., 2024a) and diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022; Esser et al., 2024; Flux, 2024) have led to surge in research aimed at integrating autoregressive architectures (Liu et al., 2024c; Sun et al., 2024a) for both multimodal understanding (Yue et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023b) and generation tasks (Ghosh et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2023). For understanding, early research has effectively integrated visual perception with pre-trained LLMs using simple visual tokenization (Li et al., 2023a) or projection methods (Li et al., 2023c; 2024a), yielding promising results. Multimodal generation, on the other hand, was initially achieved using pre-trained text-to-image models (Li et al., 2024b; Wu et al., 2023) or through an autoregressive process, where generated tokens are decoded into images (Team, 2024; Chern et al., 2024; Koh et al., 2024). Recently, researchers have started to explore the integration of Transformers and diffusion models, with the aim of unifying multimodal understanding and generation tasks within single framework (Zhou et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024b), demonstrating potential in interleaved generation of texts and images. Automatic Interleaved Text-and-Image Evaluation. Originating from early text summarization in NLP (Narayan et al., 2018), QA-based evaluation methods automatically transform prompts into questions and use them to validate generated content (Durmus et al., 2020; Deutsch et al., 2020; Eyal et al., 2019). In the multimodal domain, particularly in text-to-image generation, VQA-based evaluation methods transfer text into atomic questions and conduct VQA to verify generated images, providing enhanced fine-grained and interpretable benchmark results (Cho et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024). Notably, TIFA (Hu et al., 2023) pioneered the use of VQA for automatic evaluation. Subsequent works have enhanced model-human correlation (Yarom et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024), incorporated object detection and optical character recognition modules (Ghosh et al., 2024; Cho et al., 2024), and explored MLLM-as-a-Judge approaches (Chen et al., 2024a). However, evaluating accurate interleaved generation remains challenging. As shown in Table 1, existing benchmarks (An et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024d) heavily rely on zero-shot MLLM-as-a-Judge or traditional metrics (Chen et al., 2024d;b), leading to rough and coarse-grained assessment results. 3 Preprint. Figure 2: ISG first interprets the users query into scene-graph-like structure to enable fine-grained assessment at three levels: 1) At the structural level, ISG predicts the querys interleaved structure; 2) At the block level, nodes represent text-image blocks connected by requirement edges; 3) At the image level, the graph consists of entities, their attributes, and their relationships. Finally, ISG converts each element within the graph structure into questions, evaluates the models interleaved output using QA module, and subsequently summarizes these results into comprehensive assessment."

            "content": "We introduce ISG (Figure 2), comprehensive automatic evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation assessment. Using ISG, we introduce ISG-BENCH, benchmark for evaluating image-and-text generation. 3.1 THE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK The framework automatically interprets queries into scene-graph-like structure, where text and image blocks serve as nodes and their relationships as edges. Based on this graph representation, we can perform comprehensively four-level assessment: holistic, structural, block, and image. At each level, the framework generates several question-answer pairs that can be used to evaluate whether response appropriately answers the query. At the macro level, structural and holistic questions analyze the overall response coherence and quality; while block and image questions assess how accurately each content module adheres to the users instructions. Structural questions evaluate whether the response strictly follows the structural requirement in the users query. As shown in Figure 2, given structural requirement generate image first followed by an instruction, the correct structure should consist of 4 images interleaved by 4 text blocks. We leverage an LLM to predict the generated structure based on the query and subsequently evaluate answers through direct structural matching. Holistic questions assess the overall text-image alignment, coherence, and helpfulness by inputting the multimodal query, response, and human-annotated golden answer into an MLLM, which then outputs judgments on the entire answer. Building on previous work (An et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024d), we enhance the process by employing MLLM-as-a-Judge with golden answers and the Analyze-then-Judge Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022). This allows for more human-aligned evaluation, assessing generation quality, text-image alignment, and helpfulness to yield comprehensive score. Block questions evaluate fine-grained details within each block. We initially represent the prompt as subject-object-relation tuples (sub, obj, r), such as < Text 1, Image 1, Describe > in the example of Figure 2, where {sub, obj} are nodes that denotes image or text block and is edge that denotes an atomic open-vocabulary requirement. Subsequently, we generate questions from these tuples and evaluate them using the VQA module, with MLLMs providing Yes-or-No and 4 Preprint. Figure 3: Left: An overview of ISG-BENCH, hierarchically categorized first by task dependency and then by task definition, visualized in Figure 8. Right: Distribution analysis of textual content length and image count for queries and golden answers. Each sample incorporates both visionlanguage input and requires vision-language output, enabling assessment of the models multimodal understanding and generation capabilities. 1-10 score answers. We also attempt to use CLIPScore (Hessel et al., 2021) for assessing textimage relations, but it fails due to the text block exceeding the text encoders limit of 77 tokens. Image questions assess the semantic content of images. We transform multimodal queries into dependency-aware tuples that comprise entities, relations, and attributes, each linked to specific generated images, particularly for vision-dominant tasks such as Style Transfer and MultiAngle Object that have concrete referential answers, whereas the Painting task requires only the accurate generation of the final image. In contrast, tasks such as HowTo demand the inclusion of specific objects but allow flexibility in other aspects. We categorize tasks based on the requirement of image generation in the answers as shown in Table 2. These tuples might include <Image 1, Entity, Cat> and <Image 1, Relation, Cat, on the right of, Dog>. Subsequently, we employ an LLM to generate questions with dependencies and evaluate image generation using these questions via VQA module (Cho et al., 2023). For generating VQA questions in block and image levels, we implemented ISG with few-shot examples for in-context learning (Dong et al., 2022) and carefully verified these generated questions against human-annotated ground truth. For the evaluation of ISG-BENCH, refer to Section 4.1, and for technical details, see Appendix C.1. 3.2 THE BENCHMARK Based on ISG, we develop the first benchmark, termed ISG-BENCH, for interleaved text-and-image generation to assess multimodal understanding and generation capabilities across various tasks. As shown in Table 2, ISG-BENCH consists of categorically balanced dataset of 1,150 samples, covering 21 subtasks across 8 daily interleaved generative scenarios. Each sample includes detailed instructions and structural requirements, such as Generate four images and provide brief text description after your generated image, to evaluate both instruction-following capability and interleaved generation ability. Every query is designed to be 1) vision-language dependent, meaning it cannot be addressed using information from single modality alone, and 2) paired with carefully collected golden reference answer. All samples are collected and manually selected by the authors using cross-validation and BertScore (Zhang et al., 2019) for similarity filtering, as detailed in Appendix A.3. Data collection and quality control. Our benchmark collections involve three main stages. First, we review existing datasets according to the task definition and retrieve high-quality, nonoverlapping vision metadata to serve as the visual information in both the query and the golden answer, with some data collected by ourselves (e.g., Multi-View Scene Generation). We then curate natural language queries that reference the images for automatic evaluation. Each query specifies the required structure of the output. MLLMs are employed to generate textual answers for each task, which are subsequently reviewed by human annotators to ensure accuracy. Due to concerns 5 Preprint.

Finally, we obtain diverse and high-quality interleaved multimodal benchmark with query-answer pairs sourced from various origins. To ensure the quality of our samples, we conduct cross-validation among different annotators for format consistency and typo checking. Detailed definitions, the collection pipeline, and additional examples are provided in Appendix A. Modality Specific Assessment. We categorize each task within our ISG-BENCH into three modes (i.e., Image, Language, and Both) for their primary modality contributing to the output via decision tree (Figure 8). For example, the HowTo task requires both vision and language content to solve the problem, and Art Style Transfer requires mainly on vision generation; while VQA with Image Generation primarily relies on textual output, where the quality and accuracy of answers is mainly attributed to the language component, with generated images serving as complementary information."

            "content": "We first validate ISG against human annotations (Section 4.1), demonstrating its alignment with human judgments. Our subsequent evaluation of interleaved generation (Section 4.2) reveals the limitations of unified models and moderate success of compositional approaches, underscoring current challenges in instruction-following for interleaved generation. 4.1 EVALUATING ISG-BENCH Experiment Setups. We leverage one of the most popular MLLMs, GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), as question generation and VQA module of our ISG. We conduct experiments to verify the performance of ISG in each step with varying sample sizes and metric settings, as shown in Table 3. All results are compared with human-annotated ground truth with cross-validation. Figure 4 visualize the distributions of VQA instances in our ISG-BENCH. For the question generation module, we classify result as correct if it matches the subject and object, with BertScore (Zhang et al., 2019) higher than 0.8 compared to the ground truth. Our experiments include two settings for VQA module in ISG with an Analyze-then-Judge COT framework (Wei et al., 2022): 1-10 scoring (Lin et al., 2024) and direct Yes-or-No (Cho et al., 2023).

For MLLM-as-a-Judge, we follow previous studies to use human agreement as the evaluation metric (Chen et al., 2024a;e). ISG demonstrates commendable performance across all tasks in each module. As illustrated in Table 3, each module of ISG aligns well with human annotation. For structural, ISG exhibits consistent excellence across all tasks, indicating robust potential for capturing structural requirements in interleaved generation instructions. In both Q-Gen and VQA modules, ISG successfully extracts fine-grained requirements with high fidelity to ground truth. For the VQA module, the scoring approach consistently outperforms the Yes-or-No method, suggesting that more nuanced judgments align better with human evaluations, particularly in ambiguous cases as highlighted in Appendix C.1.1. Vision-guided tasks consistently underperform compared to other tasks, with noticeable decline in both Q-Gen and VQA modules, underscoring the challenges in automatically evaluating fine-grained aspects of interleaved text-andimage generation. In holistic evaluation, leveraging golden answer significantly outperforms the zero-shot judging setting of MLLMs, especially in vision-guided tasks, yielding an average of 20% improvement in human agreement. Figure 4: Distributions of VQA instances in Block-level (Upper) and Image-level (Lower). Ablation Study on Vision Input and Few-shot Prompting. We evaluate our ISG under two conditions: vision input and few-shot examples, for more comprehensive study. As shown in Table 4, multimodal input varies in block-level and image-level question generation, with slight enhancement in image-level question generation. In addition, few-shot in-context learning provides dramatic enhancement on both tasks, improving performance by more than 30% in block-level and 10% in image-level tasks, especially in vision-language guided tasks by limiting requirements for the predicted generative content. For language-guided tasks, few-shot learning brings 70% enhancement in block-level performance, further demonstrating the accurate evaluation framework establishment for this type of creative generation task.

We evaluate 10 frameworks capable of generating interleaved text-and-image content, four recently released unified models, Show-o1 (Xie et al., 2024), Anole (Chern et al., 2024), Minigpt-5 (Li et al., 2024b), CoMM-Minigpt-5 (Chen et al., 2024d), SEED-LLaMA (Li et al., 2023b) as well as two compositional settings, using Gemini-1.5-Pro (GeminiTeam, 2023) and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024) as multimodal preceptor2 and SD3 (Esser et al., 2024) as its generator, with SD2.1 (Rombach et al., 2022) for ablation study. For our ISG-AGENT, we use GPT-4o for planning and verification agent, and use Claude-3.5-Sonnet for tool selector, with SD3 as image generator and multiple tools (UltraEdit(Zhao et al., 2024), DynamiCrafter(Xing et al., 2023), SV3D (Voleti et al., 2024), DreamMover (Shen et al., 2024)). As for ISG, we follow the bestperformed setting in Section 4.1 for completely automatic evaluating setting. Refer to Appendix for detailed experiment setups. Unified models underperform in accurate interleaved generation. As illustrated in Table 5, all unified models exhibit significant deficiencies in following our instructions to generate interleaved text-and-image content. Many models produced only one to three images, while some failed to generate any images at all. Consequently, these models could not be subjected to block-level and image-level evaluation protocols. In terms of holistic evaluation, the models demonstrated superior capabilities in language-dominant tasks, while notably underperforming in vision-dominant tasks. This disparity further proves the hypothesis that current training datasets for unified models lack sufficient vision-dominant instruction tuning samples, such as those for Style Transfer and Image Decomposition. Notably, Show-o, as one of the first unified autoregressive models, demonstrates strong structural accuracy but suffers from hallucinations generating images based on system prompts rather than user instructions, as illustrated in Figure 39. Similarly, Anole achieves SOTA performance among unified models, highlighting the promise of its architectural design. Vision-dominated tasks challenge all models. Given that these compositional frameworks perceive images and generate images separately, i.e., not end to end, meaning that they naturally cannot perform these tasks well such as accurate image editing due to their inherent structure. On the other 1Since Show-os interleaved generation scripts are unavailable and their current checkpoint lacks multipleimage generation capability, we generate the whole answer via multi-turn dialogues. 2Given that AzureOpenAI filters most of our prompt when prompting them to generate caption for image generation, we do not evaluate GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024) here. 8 Preprint.

S l a I s H hand, although these unified models have the potential to understand and generate images in an endto-end manner and announce their capability in vision generative tasks such as Image Generation or Image Editing, they fall short in understanding multimodal queries to generate interleaved content with multiple images. As shown in Figure 6, the best unified model Anole fails to understand the output format and deviates from the context of input images, demonstrating their deficiency in generating images in vision in-context learning (Sun et al., 2024b). MLLM-as-a-Judge cannot evaluate fine-grained accurate generation. The inconsistency between holistic evaluation results and those at three fine-grained levels, as illustrated in Tables 5 and 6, reveals notable limitation in MLLM-as-a-Judge to comprehensively assess responses, even when provided with both the users instruction and correct golden answer. Specifically, Judge MLLM struggles to evaluate responses according to fine-grained criteria, such as output structure (including image count) and the detailed text-image relationships stipulated in the prompt. Furthermore, our analysis of the results presented in Table 7 uncovers an inherent bias within MLLM-as-a-Judge, namely image-quality bias, where higher scores are consistently awarded to responses featuring higher-quality image content, despite these responses potentially violating the users instructional requirements and judging guidelines. This bias demonstrates that MLLM-as-a-Judge, even provided with golden answer, still cannot properly perform accurate assessments on interleaved responses that adhere to specified requirements. 9 Preprint.

Mini-GPT5 and Seed-14B fail to generate interleaved content, while Anole generates low-quality images. 5 ISG-AGENT: DESIGNING BASELINE AGENT Although unified generation models (Chern et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Team, 2024) show potential in multimodal interleaved generation, generating interleaved text-and-image content remains challenging, even after fine-tuning. Inspired by previous compositional frameworks for vision generative tasks (Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023; Surıs et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2024), we propose ISG-AGENT, baseline agent for future work to use for the benchmark. 5.1 AGENT SETUP Figure 7 provides an overview of ISG-AGENT, which consists of three componentsplanning, execution, and refinementthat work collaboratively for interleaved text-and-image generation. Planning. This component acts as the interface for interpreting the users multimodal query and generating corresponding plan for tool usage in JSON format. The plan outlines sequential steps that primarily involve tool invocation. By leveraging an MLLM as the backbone, it ensures the creation of an accurate interleaved generation plan that strictly adheres to the users instructions, 10 Preprint. Figure 7: An overview of ISG-AGENT. The ISG-AGENT first receives users raw request. Planning: The input query is first processed into coarse plan. Tool-Use: The ISG-AGENT calls different tool from the Tool Library according to the description of the planning step. In this procedure, ISG-AGENT outputs coarse interleaved result. Refinement: The ISG-AGENT triggers self-correction mechanism base on the original result. Handling error made by both plan and tooluse procedures, and making the text more continuous. including specifications for fine-grained text-image block requirements. Each step includes clear tool execution functions and natural language descriptions for subsequent tool usage. Tool-usage. This component is responsible for executing tools with detailed logs (Schick et al., 2024). At each step, it selects the most appropriate tools from the tool library and provides refined, descriptive text and images to the designated tool, such as Vision-Language Model (VLM) for captioning and diffusion models for image generation. To avoid potential deviations during tool utilization, the agent is designed to generate descriptions that closely align with the instructions specifically for tool-calling. Refinement. This component is responsible for reviewing and enhancing the quality of the generated content from the previous step by analyzing error messages or improper generation and addressing them by reconstructing the erroneous steps with more detailed and precise execution instructions until the issues are resolved (Wu et al., 2024a). Additionally, this agent refines the text by transforming pronouns, adding conjunctions, and removing repetitive descriptions to improve consistency and textual quality, thus creating more coherent and text-image-aligned content instead of several discrete fragments. This Plan-Execute-Refine pipeline for interleaved text-and-image generation ensures that the final output closely adheres to the users instructions while autonomously handling variety of tasks effectively. We provide two examples of ISG-AGENTs performance in Figures 37 and 38. For further technical details, please refer to Appendix C.2. 5.2 EXPERIMENT RESULT ISG-AGENT outperforms in vision-dominated tasks while falling short in language-guided tasks. As shown in Table 6, ISG-AGENT strictly follows users requirements to generate interleaved content, achieving comparative results to humans golden answer in various tasks in both block-level and image-level, especially in vision-dominated tasks like Style Transfer and 3D Scene. The SOTA results in Progressive Transformation also demonstrate good coherence of the image content, even accommodate to human-collected answers. Although LLM+Diffusion frameworks fall short in accurate instruction-following, they achieve SOTA results in holistic evaluation in some language-dominate tasks, demonstrating their high generation quality of textual information. Enhanced components bring improvement to general response quality. The comparative analysis between two image generation models  (Table 6)  and ablation study on tools  (Table 7)  consistently demonstrates superior performance across various task levels when employing enhanced components, thereby underscoring the importance of advanced tools in producing more accurate and highfidelity content. Furthermore, the incorporation of refinement module significantly contributes to improved text-image alignment, substantially enhancing both block-level and holistic performance, which highlights the potential for optimizing individual components to achieve precise interleaved generation within compositional framework. 11 Preprint."

            "content": "Improving Unified Models with Advanced Interleaved Datasets. Our results highlight the potential of unified autoregressive model structures like Anole (Chern et al., 2024) and Show-o (Xie et al., 2024), while revealing substantial room for improvement in their instruction following and accurate generation capabilities. This underscores the need for dedicated interleaved datasets, particularly for vision-dominant tasks. Current datasets, limited to unimodal tasks or loosely aligned visionlanguage pairs (Chen et al., 2024d), inadequately address the challenges of generating coherent interleaved content. Additionally, existing interleaved datasets are predominantly language-centric, failing to establish robust vision-language dependencies crucial for enhanced multimodal understanding and generation. In this context, our compositional agent, ISG-AGENT, shows promise as pipeline for synthetic interleaved instruction tuning and vision-centric data, potentially advancing the development of unified generative models. Improving Evaluation Framework for Transparency and Reliability. Although we have carefully built the whole benchmark from scratch with cross-validation and evaluated the reliability of these generative models in the question generation and VQA module, concluding that its practical to use them as evaluators, the potential trustworthiness problem of LLMs should be noted as they still make mistakes in evaluation. Moreover, due to their inherent structure, their evaluation lacks transparent and interpretable results. Therefore, future direction lies in reducing the AI models in the evaluation process, like Task Me Anything (Zhang et al., 2024a), to synthetically generate questions paired with answers to evaluate model performance with highest truthfulness and confidence. Flexible and Integrative Compositional Strategy. In this study, we explore compositional agent strategy (Xiao et al., 2024) that integrates diverse model modules to generate interleaved multimodal content. Experimental results indicate that further enhancing each sub-modules performance may significantly improve the overall generative capabilities (Ma et al., 2024). Consequently, the compositional model not only demonstrates high flexibility and adaptability but also serves as pivotal component in the advancement of unified models, particularly by functioning as synthetic data pipeline to facilitate interleaved dataset construction. By leveraging high-quality generated content, this synthetic dataset further augments the generalization capabilities of unified multimodal models. Thus, its application not only contributes to exploring the upper-performance bounds of current models but also provides valuable insights and guidance for the design and optimization of future unified models. Trustworthiness of Interleaved Generation. While ISG-BENCH provides strong foundation for evaluating accurate multimodal interleaved generation, critical yet underexplored aspect is trustworthiness (Huang et al., 2024) within these models. However, evaluating trustworthiness for interleaved generation presents several key challenges: 1) Previous research (Liu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Huang & Sun, 2023) mainly focus on single-modality generative models (e.g., LLMs), while challenges across text-and-image are not well addressed. 2) Another significant challenge is assessing the robustness of interleaved generation models against adversarial inputs (e.g., jailbreak attacks (Wei et al., 2024)) or unexpected variations in prompts (Zhu et al., 2023). These models may produce misleading or harmful outputs when manipulated through subtle alterations in the input text or images. Evaluating models resistance to such attacks is particularly difficult in multimodal setting, as an attack could target just one modality (e.g., slight change in word or pixel) and still cause cascading effects on the overall output."

Figure 8: Tasks are classified by task dependency, according to the removal of one modal. DETAILED ISG-BENCH CONSTRUCTION A.1 GENERAL INFORMATION As shown in Figure 3, our benchmark are first categorized by dominated modal, i.e., Vision, Language and Both, followed by 8 categories and 21 sub-categories classified by their definitions. All samples in ISG-BENCH are featuring multimodal input (except one category) with most images collected from existing datasets and text content manually constructed. While MLLMs were used to generate golden answers for some tasks, these underwent thorough human refinement to ensure benchmark accuracy and quality. We provide all MLLM prompts used, and all image-text content was safety-reviewed to ensure benchmark security, quality, and transparency. Refer to Section A.3 for human annotation details, Section for additional quantitative analysis, and Section B.2 for NSFW evaluation results. A.2 TASK DEFINITION AND SAMPLE COLLECTION In this section, we provide detailed definitions, collecting pipelines including source datasets and how we collect golden answers, as well as examples for each task in our ISG-BENCH, aiming to provide transparent and detailed construction. A.2.1 VISUAL STORY TELLING This task involves telling story based on the input. The goal is to generate coherent narrative sequence that combines both visual and textual information from the image. Previous articles required highly specific design frameworks to accomplish visual storytelling tasks (Liu et al., 2024b; Maharana et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024a), whereas the unified model offers more general framework that is adequate for achieving the same goal. Image-based Visual Storytelling. In this task, we benchmark the capability of image understanding, narrative generation, and creativity by presenting models with input images. Based on its understanding of the input images and its creativity in continuing the story, the model is expected to generate sequence of image-text pairs. Each image should represent scene in the story, and each accompanying text should describe the content of the image while also linking it to the preceding and following images. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 40. We utilize images from the StorySalon dataset (Liu et al., 2024a), which offers rich collection of videos and e-books featuring diverse characters, storylines, and artistic styles. Captions for each Preprint. image, which include connections to the surrounding context, are generated by GPT-4o using the template shown in Figure 9. Images. Generate contextually connected captions for each image. Task: Input: Output: each image while seamlessly connecting to the surrounding context. Start with image1., image2. Here are the images:[INSERT IMAGES] Short captions that describe the storyline depicted in and so on. Figure 9: Prompt - Visual Storytelling. Text-based Visual Storytelling. In this task, we benchmark the capability of textual understanding, narrative generation and creativity by presenting models with texts. Based on the input text and its creativity in continuing the story, the model is expected to generate sequence of image-text pairs. Each image should represent scene in the story, and each accompanying text should describe the content of the image while also linking it to the preceding and following images. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 41. We utilize images from the StorySalon dataset (Liu et al., 2024a), where each image is accompanied by short caption. Captions for each image, which include connections to the surrounding context, are generated by GPT-4o using the template shown in Figure 9. Image & Text-based Visual Storytelling. In this task, we benchmark the capability of multimodal understanding, narrative generation and creativity by presenting models with image-text pairs. Based on its understanding of the input images, the text hints for subsequent episodes, and its creativity in continuing the story, the model is expected to generate sequence of image-text pairs. Each image should represent scene in the story, and each accompanying text should describe the content of the image while also connecting it to the preceding and following images. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 42. We utilize images from the StorySalon dataset (Liu et al., 2024a), which offers rich collection of videos and e-books featuring diverse characters, storylines, and artistic styles. Captions for each image, which include connections to the surrounding context, are generated by GPT-4o using the template shown in Figure 9. A.2.2 VQA WITH IMAGE GENERATION Presented with an image and question, the model is supposed to not only provide textual answer but also generate new, relevant image to support or illustrate its response. Object Q&A and Explanation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of explanatory and knowledge understanding. It involves providing model with mixed input of text and an image, where the text includes question about the images content. The model is required to identify the subject in the image and generate an interleaved output of text and images that offers thorough explanation about the subject. Examples can be found in Figure 43. In this task, we focus on daily object explanations such as animals, plants, insects, daily items and electrical devices. We collect our image data from the Internet using Google and Bing. Provided reference answer to each question is generated by GPT-4o. The prompt to get this reference answer is the same as the original question in our benchmark. Historical Event Analysis. In this task, we benchmark the capability of cultural interpretation, knowledge understanding and visual analysis. This task involves providing the model with mixed input of text and an image, where the text includes question about historical site or artifact depicted in the image. The model is required to identify the place or artifact, describe its historical significance, and generate an interleaved output of text and images that offers comprehensive analysis. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 44. We collect our image data from the Internet using Google and Bing. Provided reference answer to each question is generated by GPT-4o. The prompt to get this reference answer is the same as the original question in our benchmark. 20 Preprint. A.2.3 TEMPORAL PREDICTION The model is required to forecast future states or sequences based on initial conditions or partial information, such as predicting the progression of natural phenomenon or the steps in creating painting. Real World Simulation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of commonsense reasoning, physical understanding and temporal reasoning. This task involves real-world simulation based on an input image containing both visual elements and text, to generate an image-text sequence that represents physical world phenomena. Each step in the output sequence should include: an generated or modified image showing the progression of the action; and accompanying text describing the change or action taking place. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 45. We use dataset from Panda-70M (Chen et al., 2024c), which contains 70 million high-quality videocaption pairs across various domains, including animals, scenery, and food. We utilize GPT-4o to generate descriptions for images extracted from the relevant videos, with prompts shown in Figure 10. Generate caption for all images except the first one.

In this task, we benchmark the capability of artistic knowledge and temporal reasoning. This task involves generating sequence of images and text that simulate the process of creating painting from start to finish. The model is supposed to produce an imagetext sequence that illustrates the painting process, where each step includes: an image showing the current state of the painting; and accompanying text describing the techniques, colors, or elements being added or modified. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 46. We construct dataset sourced from various painting process videos on YouTube, encompassing range of painting styles, including oil painting, sketching, quick studies, and digital painting. Additionally, we employ GPT-4o to generate relevant descriptions of each step in the process. The prompt template is shown in Figure 11. Generate caption for all images.

A.2.4 IMAGE-TEXT COMPLEMENTATION. The model must generate images based on textual input, or conversely, produce text that complements and explains given images. In this task, visual and textual information are synergistically combined to enhance understanding and communication. HowTo. In this task, we benchmark the capability of sequential reasoning, task decomposition, and procedural understanding. Given high-level instruction or text-image pair as input, generate 21 Preprint. sequence of image-text pairs that represent steps to accomplish the given task. Each instruction will describe an action or transformation that should occur in the following frames. The output video should be consistent with the provided instructions, maintaining coherent transitions and logical scene progression. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 47. We download HowTo videos from CrossTask (Zhukov et al., 2019) and ChangeIt (Souˇcek et al., 2022), which cover instructional videos collected for different tasks. We captured the frames of the key steps from the video as output images. Descriptions are written by GPT-4o with templates outlined in Figure 12. Based on the instruction, generate caption for each image. Images sequences and instruction about [INSERT QUESTIONS].

Scientific Phenomenon Explanation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of scientific knowledge, analytical thinking and procedural understanding. This task requires the model to analyze an image depicting natural or scientific phenomenon. The model receives mixed input of text and an image, where the text includes question about how the phenomenon in the image is formed. The model is expected to identify the phenomenon, describe its formation process, and generate an interleaved output of text and images that offers detailed explanation. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 48. The data for this task is crafted manually and relevant images are also collected from the Internet using Google and Bing. Reference answers are also generated by GPT-4o with the same prompt as the original question in our benchmark. A.2.5 STYLE TRANSFER This task involves taking an input image with associated text and generating sequence of transformed images with corresponding text descriptions. Art Style Transfer. In this task, we benchmark the capability of artistic knowledge, style editing, creativity, and novelty. The model is supposed to generate style-transferred versions of the input image in different art periods (e.g., Renaissance, Impressionism, Cubism), or specified artists (e.g., Van Gogh, Picasso, Monet), each attached with style description. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 49. We use images from UnlearnCanvas (Zhang et al., 2024c), which includes high-resolution stylized images from 60 different artistic painting styles across 20 different object categories. We directly use the style name of the image to form the description. Scene Attribute Transfer. In this task, we benchmark the capability of attribute manipulation and image editing. The model is supposed to generate sequence of image-text pairs, where each image is transformed version of an input landscape photograph based on specified scene attributes (e.g., weather, lighting, time of day, season), and each text describes the applied transformation. Changes should be photorealistic and faithful to the specified attributes. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 50. We use images from TransientAttributes (Laffont et al., 2014), which includes scene appearances with 40 transient attributes related to weather, lighting, time of day, season, and more subjective impressions (e.g. mysterious and soothing). We manually choose attributes of the image from the dataset to form the description. 22 Preprint. Photo Variation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of image analysis and photo editing. The model is supposed to generate sequence of image-text pairs that show various adjustments to an input photograph, along with descriptive text for each adjustment. Adjustment Categories include exposure, sharpness, brightness, contrast, color temperature, hue, and saturation. Changes should be high-quality and natural-looking. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 51. We use photos from MIT-Adobe FiveK (Bychkovsky et al., 2011), which consists of 5 sets of 5,000 example input-output image pairs, each edited by trained photographers. We use GPT-4o to describe images and the prompt template is outlined in Figure 13. Images. Output: Task: Generate caption for all images except the first one. Input: Short captions (5-15 words) describe what adjustment has been made, when the next followed image is Do not include any compared with the first image, one by one. other information. Make sure that the number of your answers is 1 less than the number of input images. Here are the images:[INSERT IMAGES] Start with 1. and so on. , 2. Figure 13: Prompt - Photo variation. Portrait Variation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of facial analysis and image editing. The model is supposed to generate sequence of image-text pairs showing person at similar ages based on an input portrait, along with descriptive text for each image. Output images should ensure identity consistency across all generated images. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 52. We use human portraits from similar ages of the same person in MORPH dataset (Ricanek & Tesafaye, 2006). Descriptions for each step is written by GPT-4o with following prompt template in Figure 14. Images taken in similar ages. Generate caption for all images except the first one. Short captions (5-15 words) describe what is different, Task: Input: Output: when the next followed image is compared with the first image, one by one. , 2. Make sure that the number of your answers is 1 less than the number of input images. Here are the images:[INSERT IMAGES] Do not include any other information. Start with 1. and so on. Figure 14: Prompt - Portrait variation. A.2. IMAGE DECOMPOSITION This task involves image decomposition based on an input image containing both visual elements and text, with the goal of segment or generating an image-text sequence that breaks down the image into its constituent parts. Realistic Image Decomposition. In this task, we benchmark the capability of object detection and segmentation, and object recognition. The model is supposed to generate image-text pairs where each image showcases objects detected within real-world scenes. The text should detail the objects and the event or relationships between the objects. The output images should ensure the accuracy of the required object present in the image. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 53. We selected 50 images from object detection datasets COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and SA1B from Segment-Anything (Kirillov et al., 2023). Rather than using the labeled images directly, we manually identified between two to eight objects in each image to ensure clarity. To maintain task precision, we opted for less crowded scenes. The model is required to generate images that closely 23 Preprint. resemble the identified objects. Golden answers were crafted using GPT-4o, followed by manual inspection and refinement. The prompt can be found in Figure 15. Given you the task description and the original image, Task: generate captions for each object required in the task. objects key features. Input: Output: You should give feedback in the format required by the task, first describe the whole image, then orderly caption each object one by one. describe them. You dont need to generate any image, but Task description and the input image. Focus on Figure 15: Prompt - Realistic (Synthetic) Image Decomposition. Synthetic Image Decomposition. In this task, we benchmark the capability of stylized object detection, object identification and extraction. The model is supposed to generate image-text pairs that highlight the detection of objects within virtual or stylized environments, such as digital artwork or fantasy scenes. Each description should caption the corresponding objects in the image. Models should respond without losing any object and precisely cut out the objects from the image or generate similar objects within the image. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 54. We constructed the input images for synthetic image decomposition using search engines and video platforms, resulting in dataset comprising AI-generated images, real artworks, animations, pixel art, and stamps. To enhance task clarity, we selected images with fewer objects to avoid ambiguity in descriptions. Similar to the realistic image decomposition task, we utilized the above prompt in Figure 15 to generate reference answers, which were then manually inspected and corrected. Semantic Decomposition. In this task, we benchmark the capability of semantic segmentation and hierarchical understanding. The model is supposed to generate image-text pairs that present the hierarchy of the image. Output Images should precisely segment the region based on the users prompt from the raw image. The text should correctly label the segmented image and give more information about the image-text input. In addition, enhancing the composition suggestions are given. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 55. We manually selected fifty high-quality and challenging images from the BG-20K dataset (Li et al., 2022) suitable for semantic segmentation. These images encompass not only foregroundbackground distinctions but also left-right and top-bottom segmentation. To maintain clarity, we avoided overly ambiguous images. We confirmed the segmentation methods with GPT-4o and ultimately constructed golden answers using the following prompt shown in Figure 16. Given you the task description and the original image, Task: generate captions for each region required in the task. objects key features. Input: Output: You should give feedback in the format required by the task, first describe the whole image, then orderly caption each region one by one. describe them. You dont need to generate any image, but Task description and the input image. Focus on Figure 16: Prompt - Semantic Decomposition. A.2.7 3D TRANSFORMATION This task involves 3D Transformation based on an input image containing visual elements and text, with the output being an image-text sequence representing different views or angles of the scene or object. Multi-view Scene Generation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of 3D scene understanding, spatial reasoning and viewpoint synthesis. Based on the input image, the model is expected to generate sequence of image-text pairs. Each image should depict the scene from the input image 24 Preprint. as viewed from different angle, with each accompanying text explaining the observation angle. The objects in the output images must remain consistent across all views. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 56. Multi-angle Object Generation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of 3D object reconstruction and single-view to multi-view object synthesis. This task involves providing model with single image of an object within scene, along with textual instruction that specifies the generation of additional images of the object from different perspectives. The model is required to interpret the instruction and generate series of images showing the object from various angles, such as left to right, while maintaining consistency in the objects appearance. An instance can be found in Figure 57. We download images of different angles from ABO (Collins et al., 2022) where we extract golden answer images from five target perspectives. We directly use the angle to form the caption. A.2.8 PROGRESSIVE IMAGE TRANSFORMATION This task involves generating sequence of images that show gradual changes based on an initial input image and text prompt. The output is not just single transformed image, but series of images showing the progression of the transformation. We gain 90-images high quality image morphing dataset using Diffmorpher (Zhang et al., 2024b). By dividing them into two parts. One for Text-guided animation, the other for Image-guided animation. Text-guided Animation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of textual understanding and guided image progression modeling. Based on the input image and the accompanying text that explains the desired final state, the model is expected to generate sequence of image-text pairs. Each image should represent stage in the transformation process, and each accompanying text should describe the change occurring in the corresponding part. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 58. We selected 50 easily captioned image pairs from the DiffMorpher dataset (Zhang et al., 2024b). After selection, we prompted GPT-4o to generate captions for randomly selected image from each pair, replacing the image with text description as desired final stage. Since the morphing process is an open-ended problem, it aims to make sure each stage is more closer to the text description of the final stage. Image-guided Animation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of visual understanding and state transformation synthesis. Based on the input images, one representing the initial state and the other the final state, the model is expected to generate sequence of image-text pairs. Each image should depict stage in the transformation process, with each accompanying text describing the change occurring in the corresponding part. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 59. For this task, we utilized 50 randomly sampled image pairs from the Diffmorpher dataset (Zhang et al., 2024b). To enhance the diversity of the input, we employed data augmentation techniques, which included randomly selecting different initial and final stages. We shifted our focus away from strictly adhering to golden answers. This task aims to make sure each stage is more closer to the final stages image. Therefore, we pay less attention to the golden answer construction. Attribute-guided Image Generation. In this task, we benchmark the capability of controlled visual attribute manipulation and image synthesis. The model is required to generate series of images that depict gradual transitions, such as from wealth to poverty, noise to silence, or cleanliness to disorder. Each image reflects the gradual change in state, driven by the transformation or synthesis process while maintaining core structural integrity. The final images should be realistic, clearly illustrating the progression of visual states as guided by the specified changes. We provide an example of golden answer in Figure 60. The dataset is created using the DALL-E model from GPT-4o, which generates images based on prompt phrases describing key attribute changes, with accompanying image descriptions also generated by GPT-4o. The prompt template is presented in Figure 17. 25 Preprint. Image sequences about attribute-guided transitions. Short captions (5-15 words) describe the key attribute Generate caption for all images except the first one. Task: Input: Output: transitions happening in each image. and changes in the primary attributes. information. Make sure that the number of your answers is 1 less than the number of input images. Here are the images:[INSERT IMAGES] Focus on gradual transitions Do not include any other Figure 17: Prompt - Attribute-guided image generation. A.3 HUMAN ANNOTATION The annotation process on ISG is carried out independently by six authors of this paper, each bringing diverse perspective to the evaluation. Recognizing the importance of annotator diversity, we have selected individuals with varied genders, ages, and educational backgrounds, all of whom possess expertise in the domain. This diversity is instrumental in minimizing bias and enhancing the reliability of our benchmark. To ensure that our annotators are well-prepared to objectively assess ISG, we have provided them with comprehensive tutorials. These tutorials guide them on how to critically evaluate aspects of the responses, including structure, entities, attributes, and relations. Moreover, we employ crossvalidation techniques among different annotators to ensure consistency and objectivity in their judgments. This rigorous approach ensures that our data is marked with high level of precision and impartiality, providing robust foundation for our research findings. We provide an annotation interface for annotation participants, including Image-level VQA human annotation, Block-level VQA human annotation, MLLM-as-a-Judge human agreement annotation and MLLM-as-a-Judge human scoring annotation, as shown in Figure 18. 26 Preprint.

ANALYSIS ON ISG-BENCH B.1 GOLDEN ANSWER Figure 19 illustrates the distribution of image-word number per sample across eight tasks in golden answers. Darker colors indicate higher number of documents. The µ and represent the mean and median number of images/sentences in samples, respectively. These tasks range from Visual Storytelling to Progressive Image Transformation with each task having varying distributions of image-to-word ratios. In tasks like Visual Storytelling and VQA with Image Generation, there is higher concentration of words per sample (above 100), indicating that these tasks require more detailed descriptions. Meanwhile, tasks such as Style Transfer and 3D Scene Transformation, focus more on images, with lower median word count. The difference between the mean and median in several tasks also highlights the presence of outliers, particularly in tasks like Image Decomposition and Progressive Image Transformation, where few samples have significantly higher numbers of words or images per sample compared to the majority. B.2 SAFETY CHECKING This part contains examples of harmful contents. Reader discretion is recommended. In this section, we provide detailed analysis of trustworthiness problems in ISG-BENCH, focusing on NSFW content in images and text content separately. NSFW Image Filtering. Figure 20 illustrates the proportion of unsafe and safe images across all categories based on the models judgments. Out of all the images used, only two (shown in Figure 21) were genuinely unsafe. The remaining images flagged as unsafe were false positives, as demonstrated in Figure 22. NSFW Text Content Filtering. Figure 23 shows the proportions of unsafe and safe text content (both query and golden answer) across all categories, based on the models evaluations. Among the text content, only one instance in the query and five in the golden answer were truly unsafe. The rest of the flagged text were false positives, as illustrated in Figure 24. 28 Preprint.

Time for Morphing: 3 units. All the tools are plug-ins within the tool-execution phase. By integrating these tools, we develop robust pipeline that supports the generation and editing of images interleaved with textual descriptions generated by the ISG-AGENT. Refinement Phase. Refinement Phases primary capability is to handle errors arising from incorrect planning or tool calling within the Planning-Execution phases. When it fails to generate final result, it raises an error, which the ISG-AGENT then captures and addresses using different strategies based on the error category. For planning-related errors, the ISG-AGENT detect and reconstructs the entire plan solely based on the original blueprint. In contrast, for other types of errors, it meticulously examines the plan step by step, regenerating relevant input text to provide clearer instructions and ultimately produce an error-free result. Additionally, ISG-AGENT is tasked with smoothing the plan in this phase by creating more continuous text segments, process facilitated by leveraging the LLM. The prompt used for this operation is illustrated in Figure 36. Limitations. While our agent framework is designed to handle variety of general interleaved tasks, several limitations must be acknowledged. Lack of Continuity Despite the Planning Agents comprehensive understanding of the objectives at each step, the Tool Agent encounters difficulties in accessing information from earlier stages and input accurate information into the tool. Given that large language models operate as black boxes, it is difficult to control the exact prompts input into the Tool Agent, further exacerbating the issue of continuity. Resource Intensity significant challenge associated with multi-agent systems is the high resource cost. In our framework, the Tool Agents effectiveness is heavily dependent on meticulously planned initial phase. If the planning is not sufficiently detailed or well-structured, the operational efficiency and overall performance of the Tool Agent can be substantially compromised, leading to increased time and computational resource expenditures. C.3 MODEL SETTINGS Open-source Unified Models. We employed four open-source unified models, namely Show-o, Mini-GPT5, Anole, CoMM-MiniGPT5 (Mini-GPT5 finetuned on CoMM) and SeedLlama-14B. All hyper-parameters are detailed as follows: Show-o (Xie et al., 2024) Guidance Scale: 1.75, generation timesteps: 18, temperature: 0.7, resolution: 256 256. Mini-GPT5 (Zheng et al., 2023). Image size: 224. temperature: 0.7, repetition penalty: 1.2, guidance scale: 7.5 9https://github.com/leoShen917/DreamMover 37 Preprint. Task: You are proficient planning agent tasked with writing step-by-step plan for tool agent based on multimodal input. Generate strictly JSON-formatted plan, ensuring each step leads the tool agent towards coherent final result. Key Instructions: - Step Format: Each Step contains Task Category (Only three labels Call tool, Caption and AddImage), Input text and Input images fields and Output field. AddImage step only contains Task and Input images fields. - Control Tool Usage: All the Call tool steps will be executed at the beginning in order, creating an orderly generated image list [<GEN 0>, <GEN 1>,...], this Task do not affect the final output and the structure because all the generated images will be add to the output in AddImage step. - Control Result Format: Design the relationship between Caption step and AddImage step to fit the structural requirement. Caption step will add text part indicating <gen text{ID}> placeholder in the structure, to the final result, while AddImage step will add an image fragment to the final result, indicating <gen img{ID}> placeholder in the structure. So you should design the order of Caption and AddImage steps to fit the given plan structural requirement. Do not plan several continuous Caption steps, which will be merged into one text fragment in the end. - Tool Guidance: Each Call tool steps text instruction should guide the tool agent on which tool to utilize. Use clear terms like Generate one image, Edit the image, Generate continuous video, Generate 3D views, Morphing from as needed. Look for the Tool Box for more details. Tool Box: - ImageGeneration: Generates one image based on descriptive text only. No references allowed. ImageGeneration is expert in text-guided image generation, but it cannot see any input image. - ImageEdit: Edits an input image based on provided prompt and the image. Proficient at editing images like style transfer, attribute modification, and handling subtle changes. When the task requires change in the input image, use this tool. - VideoGeneration: Creates sequence of images by input text and one input image guidance. returning several image screenshots of continuous event. You have to mention how many images you want from this tool. VideoGeneration tool is expert in frame-contiguous and short-time-contiguous generation. Cannot Coexist with other tool in one plan and only can be used once in task. Do not use this tool to handle subtle changes in image. - Video3DGeneration: Returns multiple chosen views of 3D object from single input image. The chosen views should be clearly stated in the Call tool Input text in the format [Angle1: Degree-left/right, Angle2: ...]. Only Use this tool when the user wants to retrieve multiple different views of 3D object or 3D scene from single image at once. Cannot Coexist with other tool in one plan and only can be used once in task. You should provide list of views you want to get in the input text. - ImageMorph: Return four images of the process of morphing from the first image to the second image. Only Use this tool when the user wants to retrieve the morphing process between two images. Give really simple caption like: photo of [cls] in the instruction for tool agent to prompt the tool. Cannot Coexist with other tool in one plan and only can be used once in task. You should provide two images in the input images. Figure 34: Prompt - Agent planning prompt - Part 38 Preprint. Remember: Different tool have different input restrictions like any input image, any text input, input , and can return different result. You are not doing the task yourimage number, ... self, think of the tool agent! ImageGeneration: input text only; ImageEdit: input text and one image; VideoGeneration: input text and one image; Fixed3DGeneration: input image; Free3DGeneration: input image; ImageMorph: input two images. Warning: - When your instruction for Call tool is aiming to call VideoGeneration, 3DGeneration or ImageMorph, remember these three tools can not coexist with all the other tools in one plan and can only be planned once for the whole task. - Caption is always executed after all the images are generated, so you should plan any input image in the caption step if necessary. - Video/3D Generation is less controllable by text so if you want to make textcontrollable generation and edit, use ImageGeneration or ImageEdit. Considerations: - Use explicit terms to avoid ambiguity (e.g., Edit the image for edits, Generate an image for new creations). - Each Caption instruction should ask the tool agent to describe every aspect of the image you want to get, instead of generating the caption yourself. - Each Call tool instruction should be descriptive, focusing on the desired attributes, styles, and settings of the images. - For sequential tasks, maintain consistency in characters, plot, and style across scenes by instruction. - When comparing multiple images, ensure the original image is listed first. You should plan comparison with two or more images in the caption step if the task indicates image comparison or contrast, like multi-perspectives contrast. - The output should be strictly in JSON format, else the extraction will fail. - Output placeholders: For original input images, use #image{ID}#. For all images to be outputted during the process, use <GEN ID> to replace them. For each steps output, use <WAIT> as placeholder. Check the example for more details. Note: If you want the tool agent to generate an image, your Input text cannot use pronouns like previous outline, original image, etc., to refer to any image. Instead, you should provide detailed description of the image you want to refer to. For example: Generate an image of the right cat from the original image. The cat should be white and fluffy, curled up next to toy. should be modified to Generate an image of cat. The cat should be white and fluffy, curled up next to toy. Must: Your output JSON file must be in officially strict format; any deviation will cause the failure of the evaluation.

Provide detailed explanation of the principles behind the phenomenon, including relevant knowledge. You should answer my question in text first and then generate four interleaved images and text to thoroughly explain the phenomenon. Golden answer: The phenomenon in the picture is volcanic eruption, which occurs when magma from beneath the Earths crust is expelled to the surface. This eruption is often characterized by the expulsion of lava, ash, and gases. <image1> The magma originates from the mantle, where it melts due to high pressure and temperature. As magma rises through the Earths crust, it collects in magma chamber beneath the volcano. When pressure in the chamber exceeds the strength of the surrounding rock, an eruption occurs. <image2> During the eruption, lava flows from the volcano, while volcanic ash and gases are ejected into the atmosphere. The composition of lava can vary, influencing the eruption style, with basaltic lava producing relatively gentle eruptions and more viscous andesitic or rhyolitic lavas leading to explosive eruptions. <image3> Volcanic eruptions can also create new landforms such as volcanic cones or calderas, shaped by the accumulation of erupted materials. <image4> Figure 48: Example of Scientific Phenomenon Explanation. 51 Preprint."

Create series of 5 PNG images that gradually transition from the initial state to the final state. Please provide brief text description explaining the changes made. Descriptions should be put after each image. For example: {second stage} [description1], ... {final stage} [description5]. Ensure that the transitions are natural and progressively illustrate the changes between states. Golden answer: At the second stage <image1>, the stack of pancakes appears slightly taller with an added layer. The toppings remain similar, but the overall arrangement looks bit more minimal, maintaining the berries and syrup. In the third stage <image2>, the pancake stack continues to grow taller with another added layer. The toppings have been reduced further, with fewer berries on top, enhancing the minimalistic appearance. The fourth stage <image3> shows an even taller stack with another layer added. The quantity of berries decreases slightly, keeping the minimal topping arrangement consistent. At the fifth stage <image4>, the pancake stack continues to rise with an additional layer. The berries appear to be fewer, maintaining minimal topping display. At the final stage <image5>, the pancake stack reaches its maximum height with the tallest stack yet. The toppings are further minimized, with just few berries and hint of syrup, achieving the intended minimalistic composition. Figure 58: Example of Text-guided Animation 60 Preprint. Example of Image-guided Animation Input:<image1> (left) represents the initial state, and <image2> (right) represents the final desired state. Create series of 4 PNG images that gradually morph from the initial state to the final Include brief text description after each state. image explaining the changes made in each step. For example: {second stage} [description1]. ... {penultimate stage} [description4].. Ensure that the transitions are natural and progressively illustrate the changes between states. Golden answer: At the second stage <image1>, the fur appears slightly longer and the color pattern remains consistent, though the overall form of the dog seems slightly larger and the background remains unchanged. In the third stage <image2>, the dogs ears appear to be lengthening slightly, and subtle changes in the shading on the fur give it slightly fuller appearance, while the background maintains its consistency. In the fourth stage <image3>, there is noticeable increase in the length and volume of the dogs fur, with more defined transition in coloration on the coat. The background starts to blend more with the dogs fur tones, creating more cohesive look. At the penultimate stage <image4>, the dogs fur has grown significantly longer and thicker, resembling more closely that of Border Collie. The overall composition of colors on the coat reflects this transformation, and the background has transitioned to an outdoor scene, enhancing the natural look of the dog. Figure 59: Example of Image-guided Animation Preprint. Example of Attribute-guided Image Generation Input: will give you an image of man sitting in room <image1>. Please show me the process of the man becoming increasingly poor, using combination of 4 images and text. For example, {1st image} [description1], {2nd image} [description2], {3rd image} [description3]. Golden answer: <image1> The man is sitting in room that appears somewhat cluttered but still functional. His clothes are clean, and the room, although slightly messy, is in relatively good condition <image2> The mans clothes appear worn, and the room is becoming more disorganized, with more clutter accumulating around him. <image3> The man is visibly more disheveled, and the room has significantly deteriorated, with trash and debris scattered across the floor. <image4> The man looks exhausted, his clothes are tattered, and the room is in state of disrepair, filled with broken furniture and debris, reflecting deep poverty.
