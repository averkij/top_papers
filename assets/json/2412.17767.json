            "content": "LLMs have proved themselves to be powerful copilots in scientific research (AI4Science & Quantum, 2023), demonstrating their great potential for accelerating and automating scientific discovery. Despite the promising finding, there remains more ambitious question to answer: Can we simulate human research community with LLMs? Answering such question has multiple benefits: (1) simulating research communities helps understand the underlying process behind the discovery of existing research ideas; (2) it can further help democratize and accelerate the idea discovery process. However, simulating the human research community is challenging, as it involves leveraging multiple LLM agents to interact with heterogeneous and research-related data. While existing multi-agent LLM frameworks have been successfully applied to areas like social simulation (Zhou et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023) and game simulation (Hua et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023), they are not well-suited for simulating research communities due to the complexity of collaborative research activities like paper writing and review writing. Although recent efforts have explored research automation using LLMs, these frameworks are typically limited to specific research tasks, such as idea generation (Girotra et al., 2023) or code experimentation (Huang et al., 2024), or focus on simulating the workflow of single researcher (Lu et al., 2024). These frameworks cannot simulate collaborative research activities where researchers from diverse backgrounds and expertise work together to brainstorm ideas, have discussions, and review papersprocesses that are fundamental to modern human research.

An agent-data graph has researchers as agent nodes and blogs, codebases, and papers as data nodes. Without loss of generality, we abstract it into simplified version with only researcher and paper nodes and focus on critical research tasks including paper reading, paper writing, and review writing. Each data node has hidden state hu and each agent node is paired with an agent function fv() and hidden state hv. Research community as graph. Our key observation is that the deeply interconnected research community can be naturally represented as graphs. Indeed, similar graph structures like citation networks (Newman, 2001) and academic social networks (Tang et al., 2008) have been extensively studied within data mining research, with proven values in applications such as citation prediction (Holm et al., 2020), recommendation (West et al., 2016) and community detection (Yang & Leskovec, 2012). Introducing LLMs to graph-structured research community can extend these classic works from static analysis to dynamic simulation and real-time forecasting. Novel framework for research simulation. In this work, we propose RESEARCHTOWN, simulator of the human research community. To bridge the gap between existing multi-agent simulation frameworks and the complexity of research activities, we propose graph-based framework, inspired by the message-passing mechanism in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), for multi-agent simulation. Concretely, as shown in Figure 1, we propose new concept of agent-data graph with 2 generic types of nodes: agent nodes, suitable for entities like agents, and data nodes, suitable for entities such as papers, reviews, and blogs. Agent-data graphs are unique from standard heterogeneous graphs; here, the key conceptual difference between agent and data nodes is that an agent node can be considered function over data nodes. To inference on agent-data graphs, we propose TextGNN framework where message-passing processes are defined based on text-form information processing with LLMs, thanks to their strong in-context learning (Wei et al., 2023) and reasoning (Lee et al., 2024) ability. We apply the proposed agent-data graph and TextGNN to the research simulation. Here, research community can be regarded as special form of agent-data graph, called community graph, with research agents and research papers as two types of nodes, and we consider three types of edges (review, author, and cite) in the graph. Different community activities, such as paper writing and review writing, can be modeled as special message-passing processes on the community graph. Novel evaluation for research simulation. With RESEARCHTOWN for research simulation, further research question is to evaluate the quality of that. Prior works primarily use human evaluation with breakdown metrics like novelty, excitement, feasibility, and expected effectiveness (Si et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024b). These approaches inevitably suffer from subjectiveness and high costs. In our work, graph-based RESEARCHTOWN naturally provides similarity-based evaluation method, by masking given paper node in the community graph and evaluating if simulator can reconstruct the masked nodes. Such definition gets rid of high-quality human annotations, making it scalable and objective. With the help of such node masking prediction task, we build benchmark called RESEARCHBENCH with 1,000 paper writing tasks and 200 review writing tasks for systematic evaluation. Main discoveries. Based on the evaluation results from RESEARCHBENCH, we highlight three key findings: (1) RESEARCHTOWN accurately simulates collaborative research activities, achieving similarity score of 0.67 for paper writing and 0.49 for review writing, as measured by state-of-theart text embedding models; (2) RESEARCHTOWN demonstrates robustness in research simulation, showing continuous improvement when more researchers or reviewers are added and maintaining"

In real-world graph tasks, nodes often have textual attributes to carry richer information, forming text-attributed graphs (TAGs) (Yang et al., 2021; He et al., 2023). Previous work on TAGs mainly treats LLMs as tools for understanding text attributes and aims at achieving co-training LLMs and GNNs (Zhao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024). In contrast, our approach incorporates agent nodes into the graph, enabling text-based message passing between agent nodes and data nodes. Furthermore, while previous TAG research mainly focuses on node prediction and link prediction tasks (Yan et al., 2023), RESEARCHTOWN extends this scope by targeting both the reconstruction of existing nodes and the prediction of new, non-existent nodes. Graphs for multi-agent modeling. Recent works model multi-agent communication using graphs and develop learnable methods to optimize the communication process (Zhuge et al., 2024; Martinkus et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024a). However, these works often neglect the interactive nature of data, where agents can read, write, and update shared data iteratively. Currently, few works include well-defined framework to represent graphs that integrate both agents and their associated data."

            "content": "Definition of agent-data graphs. To initiate our discussion, we formally define the proposed agent-data graph. An agent-data graph is special type of heterogeneous graph = (V, E), where = Va Vd is the node set consisting of two types of nodes, agent nodes and data nodes, and = Eaa Ead Edd is the edge set consisting of three types of relations, agent-agent, data-data, and agent-data interactions. Here, each data node Vd comes with attributes, e.g., piece of text, xv; each agent node is accompanied with an agent function, e.g., an LLM fu() with its prompt template and the profile. Each agent function is responsible for two types of tasks: message generation and message aggregation. More details about agent functions are in Appendix C.3. Without loss of generality, we assume the data nodes have text attributes, and leave the extension of our work to multi-modal information, e.g., images, audio, and videos, to future works. Uniqueness of agent-data graphs. Unlike standard heterogeneous graphs, the uniqueness of an agent-data graph is that the agent nodes take functions as their attributes, rather than embeddings. Concretely, each agent node could take piece of text, e.g., xv from one data node, as the input and output new data based on its profile prompt xu, e.g., xuv = fu([xu, xv]) where [] indicates filling the prompt template with xu and xv. Such definition greatly facilitates the multi-agent scenarios where agents could communicate among themselves, with edge type Eaa; interacting with the environment, with edge type Ead; representing the inherent data relationships within an environment Edd. Example of agent-data graphs. Figure 1 shows concrete example of the agent-data graph. Its definition could be extended to more node types (e.g., codebase, blogs) and edge types (e.g., attend, post, commit). Typically, the appearance of one blog post can be directly related to multiple researchers, papers, and other blog posts. Therefore, such entities are directly connected with it."

To further simulate based on given real-world agent-data graph, we need agentic models, e.g., LLMs, to generate new data and interactions on the agent-data graph. To this end, motivated by the message-passing algorithm in GNNs, we proposed text-based message-passing mechanism on an agent-data graph, called TextGNN, where all hidden states are defined in the text space instead of the embedding space."

Afterward, the goal is to learn useful node embeddings hv by iteratively aggregating information from local neighborhoods. Hidden states, message functions, and aggregation functions are the three main components in one GNN layer. The k-th iteration of message passing (or the k-th GNN layer) is typically defined as: (k)(cid:0)h(k1) (v)}(cid:1) (k)(h(k1) = MSG = AGG , {m(k) m(k) h(k) (1) ) is the node embedding at the k-th layer, h(0) where h(k) = xv is the initial node feature, and (v) is (k)() is transformative function to convert the hidden states of the set of neighbors of node v. MSG (k)() is defined to update the hidden states of node one node into message for aggregation. AGG based on neighborhood messages. More generally, we can broadly consider the k-th layer of GNN to be an aggregation function that implicitly includes message functions inside: h(k) = AGG (k)(cid:0)h(k1) , {h(k1) (v)}(cid:1) (2) Message passing in TextGNN. Following the message-passing process in the standard GNN, we now define general form of the aggregation function to describe the text-based message-passing process on an agent-data graph G. The key difference between standard GNN and TextGNN is that all the hidden states in standard GNN are defined in the embedding space (hv Rd) while those in TextGNN are defined in the text space (hv Σ). In TextGNN, we first set the initial hidden states for data nodes h(0) = xv, where xv are text attributes, and the initial hidden states for agent nodes is empty h(0) = . Next, we design general form of message passing function that handles three distinctive types of interactions, agent-agent Eaa, agent-data Ead, and data-data Edd. Specifically, the k-th TextGNN layer for an agent node Va can be written as h(k) = AGG (cid:16)(cid:104) = fu (k)(cid:0)fu(), h(k1) (cid:110) h(k1) fa , , {fa(), h(k1) (u, a) Eaa}, {h(k1) (u, d) Ead}(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:2)h(k1) , h(k1) , h(k1) (cid:3)(cid:1) (u, a) Eaa, (u, d) Ead (cid:111)(cid:105)(cid:17) (3) where [] is the concatenation function between texts to fill in the prompt template, h(k) represents the hidden states of the k-th layer of V, fa() represents the agent function paired with the agent node in the neighborhood and fu() represents the agent function paired with the target agent node. Similarly, the k-th TextGNN layer for data node Vd can be written as h(k) = AGG (cid:16)(cid:104) = fg (k)(cid:0)h(k1) (cid:110) h(k1) , , {fa(), h(k1) (cid:0)(cid:2)h(k1) , h(k1) fa (v, a) Ead}, {h(k1) (v, d) Edd}(cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:1) (v, a) Ead, (v, d) Edd , h(k1) (cid:111)(cid:105)(cid:17) (4) where fg() is defined as global agent function without specialized profile, and fa() is the agent function paired with the agent node in the neighborhood."

We first describe the concept of community graph as the instantiation of an agent-data graph in research simulation. Then, we describe the specific TextGNN layers that are used to model each type of research activity. Agent-data graph for research community modeling - community graph. We adapt agent-data graph = (V, E) to research community simulation, which we named as community graph.

We consider the process of adding non-existent paper node into the community graph including three stages: paper reading to insert agent nodes, paper writing to insert data nodes, and review writing for deciding whether to drop generated nodes or not. TextGNN for research activity simulation. Based on the constructed community graph, we further identify the key types of research activities where TextGNN can be used for simulation. Specifically, we split the research simulation process includes three critical stages: (1) paper reading (2) paper writing (3) review writing. We believe these stages are crucial in the research community and each stage relies on the output of the previous stage as the input. We provide detailed description for each stage and the corresponding TextGNN layer definition below. Stage 1: Paper reading. Reading papers to collect insights is necessary process for initializing research project. In the community graph, the paper reading process can be described as inserting new agent node to the community graph and aggregating its neighborhood information based on Equation 3. Here, the new agent profile is non-existent before reading collection of papers, and the profile is created after the paper reading process, making the TextGNN layer unique. Concretely, by adapting Equation 3, the TextGNN layer for paper reading can be written as: hu = AGG(cid:0)fu(), {hd (u, d) Ead}(cid:1) = fu ([{hd (u, d) Ead}]) (5) where hu, {fa(), ha (u, a) Eaa} in Equation 3 are empty since the agent node is initialized as empty and is not directly connected with any agents, and Ead specifically refers to the authorship relation between agent and data nodes. Equation 3 degrades to an aggregation of papers based on the researcher agent without the profile, illustrated in Figure 2 Stage 1. Stage 2: Paper writing. After paper reading, the next important research stage is paper writing. Different from paper reading, the paper writing process can be understood as inserting inserting new data node to the community graph. Here, the new data node is non-existent before writing the paper, and the data node is created after the paper writing process. Concretely, by adapting Equation 4, the TextGNN layer for paper writing can be written as: hv = AGG(cid:0){fa(), ha (v, a) Ead}, {hd (v, d) Edd}(cid:1) = fg (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:8)fa (cid:0)(cid:2)ha, hd (cid:3)(cid:1) (v, a) Ead, (v, d) Edd (cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:1) (6) where hv in Equation 4 is empty since the paper node content is non-existent before paper writing; here, Ead specifically refers to authorship relations between agent and data nodes, and Edd refers to citation relations within data nodes. visualization of Equation 6 is shown in Figure 2 Stage 2. Stage 3: Review writing. The review writing task is the final stage of the automatic research simulation, serving as reflection stage in the multi-agent research simulator. The difference between the previous 2 stages is that first, the researchers involved during review writing are not the authors but the reviewers of the paper. Additionally, review writing is based on written paper where hv is no longer empty. Concretely, by adapting Equation 4, the TextGNN layer for review writing can be written as: rv = AGG(cid:0)hv, {fa(), ha (v, a) Ead}, {hd (v, d) Edd}(cid:1) (cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:1) (v, a) Ead, (v, d) Edd (cid:0)(cid:2)ha, hv, hd (cid:0)(cid:2)hv, (cid:8)fa = fg (7) Summary: RESEARCHTOWN simulation algorithm.

As we show next, we propose to view research evaluation as masked node prediction task, including evaluation for both paper writing and review writing. Evaluation by masked node prediction. masked node prediction task in the community graph can be defined as first masking specific node in the community graph by setting its hidden states hv = , where the original hidden state is saved as v; then an ideal model should be able to predict the hidden states of the masked node from its neighborhood (v). Concretely, in Equation 6, the output hv can be regarded as the masked node prediction for evaluation of paper writing, suppose that the node is masked version of ground truth data node. Similarly, in Equation 7, the output rv can be regarded as the predicted node attributes for review writing, where the original review is represented as v. In general, we have: hv, rv = RESEARCHTOWN (G(V, E); {xu (v)}; v) (8) where hv is the text-form hidden states of masked node and rv is the text-form prediction output of masked node v. Since we have real-world results for both paper writing and review, we treat them as ground truth even though they are not perfect because the goal of RESEARCHTOWN is to simulate the human research community rather than to find optimal solutions for papers and reviews (h for review ground-truth) and we can systematically evaluate both processes to check the effectiveness of our simulation algorithm. More specifically, since we can observe ground-truth papers when evaluating the review quality, to avoid accumulated errors, we update Equation 7 during evaluation so that reviews rv are generated based on v, {fa(), ha (v, a) Ead}, {hd (v, d) Edd}(cid:1) for paper ground-truth and rv = AGG(cid:0)h v, instead of hv: (9) More details on paper evaluation. To evaluate the paper writing stage, we define distance function dp(, ) to measure the similarity between the generated paper hv and the ground-truth paper v. Since directly comparing full papers in different formats can be challenging and inaccurate, we align hv and into unified format using well-recognized framework 1 that summarizes the core components of paper through five questions: (1) What is the problem? (2) Why is it interesting and important? (3) Why is it hard? (4) Why hasnt it been solved before? (5) What are the key components of my approach and results? We mark these questions as Q1-Q5 for short. By using an LLM-based summarization function fsum(), we convert the input papers into an aligned text-based list av = fsum(hv) and corresponds to the answer of one question mentioned above.

For paper writing, as shown in Table 1, the overall similarity score obtained using textembedding-3-large across 1,000 papers is 67.28. Notably, the score increases to 74.63 for an easy subset of the benchmark. These results demonstrate that paper writing with RESEARCHTOWN can produce realistic outputs compared to real-world ones. Moreover, it indicates that some ideas in top-tier conference papers are not hard to figure out and can be imagined by LLMs. For review writing, as shown in Table 2, the similarity scores are generally lower compared with paper writing, with strength-related scores averaging around 51 and weakness-related scores averaging around 47. This suggests that review writing is more challenging to generate with RESEARCHTOWN, particularly for weaknesses. possible explanation is that real-world review data is often noisier and more diverse, especially for the weaknesses, making it harder to simulate accurately. Special case: RESEARCHTOWN can potentially come up with high-impact ideas. Besides the full results on RESEARCHBENCH, we also evaluate RESEARCHTOWN under extreme conditions by attempting to simulate 100 of the most-cited machine learning papers from the past decade. As shown in Figure 3, RESEARCHTOWN achieves low similarity scores for papers introducing groundbreaking methods, such as Layer Normalization (Ba, 2016), or novel topics, such as Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP (Strubell et al., 2019). However, the framework performs notably better on impactful papers focused on analysis or tool development. For instance, it achieves similarity score exceeding 0.8 for papers like Is BERT Really Robust? Strong Baseline for Natural Language Attack on Text Classification and Entailment (Jin et al., 2020), which provides adversarial analysis, and Stanza: Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit for Many Human Languages (Qi et al., 2020), which offers practical toolkit. These results suggest that generating high-impact research ideas may be more feasible than commonly perceived, and RESEARCHTOWN could potentially serve as tool to inspire future impactful research. Paper writing: multi-researchers participation improves paper quality. As shown in Table 1, cited papers contribute more effectively than authors in paper writing simulation, with dataaggregation achieving score of 66.72 compared to 54.61 for agent-aggregation. The best results are obtained by combining both, surpassing data aggregation by 0.56 points. Researchers are particularly beneficial under hard scenarios, improving the text-embedding-large-3 score from 55.83 to 59.59, likely due to the inclusion of multi-hop paper information from researchers. Review writing: multi-reviewers participation improves review quality. Unlike paper writing, review writing relies heavily on the target paper, making reviewers and cited papers less impactful, with differences limited to within 1 point. However, as shown in Table 2, adding additional infor-"

Agent aggregation performs best for writing strengths and assigning scores, while data aggregation achieves the best results for writing weaknesses. This likely reflects the need for related work comparisons to identify weaknesses, while multiple reviewers contribute to more comprehensive evaluation of strengths. Interestingly, combining agent and data aggregation leads to decrease in score differences, possibly because the presence of related papers causes reviewers to apply stricter novelty judgments."

In contrast, using cited papers from the introduction section reduces the score to 65.9, while papers from other sections lower it further to 58.9.

For each example, we include RESEARCHTOWNs responses to two questions: What is the problem? and What are the key components of my approach and results? as these are the most critical among the five questions mentioned in Section 6. Appendix provides the full contents of the above two and more examples for interdisciplinary research. real-world use, RESEARCHTOWN is designed to generate non-existent papers and reviews without pre-defined neighborhoods, requiring the automatic construction of neighborhoods by matching researchers and papers. This process introduces out-of-distribution scenarios, such as interdisciplinary research, where unrelated papers and researchers from distinct domains form an unconventional neighborhood for target paper node, with no similar related works existing beforehand. RESEARCHTOWN can inspire interdisciplinary research. Interdisciplinary research is often difficult to conduct in the real world due to lack of collaboration between researchers from different fields. RESEARCHTOWN overcomes this barrier by enabling researcher agents with diverse expertise to read papers, collaborate, and generate innovative ideas together. For instance, as shown in Figure 7, combining researchers and papers from NLP and astronomy produces the novel idea of using kinematic models to study the evolution of linguistic systems. Similarly, combining researchers and papers from NLP and criminology led to the concept of leveraging LLMs to support communities impacted by mass incarceration. We find that there is little existing work combining such domains. These concrete examples highlight how RESEARCHTOWN facilitates the creation of pioneering and unexplored cross-domain research ideas. RESEARCHTOWN-written contents might have limited use in the real world. We observe failure modes in RESEARCHTOWN when combining researchers and papers from too many domains. The generated content often becomes meaningless mix of terms. For example, combining researchers and papers from LLM, biology, criminology, and astronomy, RESEARCHTOWN generates research question of How does coded language in political discourse influence societal biases, and how can Bayesian hierarchical model be employed to analyze this effect while simultaneously addressing observational biases in white dwarf population studies? It simply strings together terminology from different domains without presenting clear research direction. Such vagueness in implementation and analysis details might hinder the real use of the papers simulated from RESEARCHTOWN."

We start by defining an agent-data graph as an abstract model to describe the human research community. Furthermore, we define TextGNN framework that describes the messagepassing process on the agent-data graph. By treating the research community as specialized form of the agent-data graph, RESEARCHTOWN unifies various research activitiesincluding paper reading, paper writing, and review writinginto cohesive inference process powered by TextGNN. With the help of RESEARCHTOWN, we can simulate research activities that closely mirror real-world efforts and leverage multiple agents to enhance the robustness of the simulation. Additionally, RESEARCHTOWN further inspires interdisciplinary research, which is rare in the real world, allowing research agents from different domains to brainstorm novel ideas together. We believe that RESEARCHTOWN provides useful platform and opens new avenues for systematic evaluation and the development of algorithms for automating research processes."

We first discuss how RESEARCHTOWN prevents dangerous use including facilitating plagiarism, producing misleading or low-quality claims, and role-playing human researchers. Furthermore, we discuss the attribution and authorship issues for generated content and discuss the model and data license in our work. B.1 POTENTIAL TO FACILITATE PLAGIARISM Generative AIs capabilities for image and text generation can potentially lead to plagiarism in research (Elali & Rachid, 2023). To address this, we have implemented safeguards to ensure responsible usage. RESEARCHTOWN is designed as an assistive tool to help researchers gather inspiration for paper and review writing, rather than generating complete, ready-to-use content. By design, RESEARCHTOWN ensures that its outputs serve as starting point for further intellectual effort, rather than replacement for human researchers. For generated papers, RESEARCHTOWN provides only preliminary answers to five key research questions. These outputs are intentionally incomplete and generic, requiring significant refinement and further development by the user. Critical sections such as the introduction, background, methodology, discussion, and conclusion are not included, placing the responsibility for completing and validating the content on the researcher. For generated reviews, RESEARCHTOWN provides general guidance on potential strengths and weaknesses, accompanied by an indicative score for reference. However, these reviews are intentionally non-definitive and generic, only as supplementary aid to help reviewers organize their thoughts. Generated reviews do not replace human judgment in determining the acceptance or rejection of paper. The final evaluation, including critical reasoning, detailed feedback, and the ultimate decision, remains the sole responsibility of the reviewer. Reviewers must ensure fairness, accuracy, and rigor, using AI outputs only as starting point to enhance their assessment process. B.2 POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE MISLEADING OR LOW-QUALITY CLAIMS The motivation behind our paper is to simulate research activities and generate preliminary research progress (e.g., papers and reviews) that can be scrutinized and validated by human researchers, ultimately contributing to the acceleration of the research process. We acknowledge that AI-generated ideas may vary in quality, and therefore, these outputs are not intended for direct dissemination. Instead, they serve as initial, unofficial suggestions that require further experimentally validated by human researchers. This approach ensures that only rigorously tested and verified research is presented as final, high-quality work. B.3 POTENTIAL TO ROLE-PLAY HUMAN RESEARCHERS The primary objective of our work is to leverage existing academic literature to simulate research activities. In this paper, our research agents are designed to act as research domain experts, generating informative and relevant content based on given and limited research domain. Importantly, we do not aim to simulate human-like interactive dialogues between research agents, nor do we attempt"

By focusing on publicly available research papers, we align with the papers intended purpose: contributing to the collective advancement of knowledge and fostering academic growth. B.4 ATTRIBUTION AND AUTHORSHIP The AI-generated content, such as papers, reviews, or other research outputs, is meant for internal discussion and as reference to assist human researchers. These outputs are not intended for direct publication. Our proposed methods serve as tools to accelerate the research process by offering starting points that require further elaboration, critical analysis, and human refinement to reach publishable standard. The final authority to complete and submit research lies solely with human authors, ensuring that full responsibility and ownership remain with them.

We introduce the definition of fa() to maintain scalability and alignment with traditional Graph Neural Network definitions. In practice, we can easily parallelize fa() over all data nodes, which means we can prompt once and put all data nodes information in one prompt to get the results instead of repeating the prompting process on each data node. Thus, we provide modified version of the original aggregation process below. While the paper reading process remains the same for implementation, the paper writing process can be alternatively calculated as: This setting extends Equation 6 to hv = AGG(cid:0), {fa(), ha (v, a) Ead}, {hd (v, d) Edd}(cid:1) (cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:2)ha, {hd (v, a) Edd}(cid:3)(cid:1) (v, a) Ead (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:8)fa = fg (20)"

            "content": "In this section, we provide the technical details included in the construction process of RESEARCHBENCH. We describe the methodologies used for data collection across its three main components and we name them as: (1) PAPERBENCH, (2) HIGHIMPACTPAPERBENCH, and (3) REVIEWBENCH. Statistically, PAPERBENCH and HIGHIMPACTPAPERBENCH focus on paper writing simulation, which contains 1,000 and 100 tasks, respectively. REVIEWBENCH focuses on review writing simulation and includes 200 tasks. D.1 DATA COLLECTION DETAILS We first include technical details related to how we collect paper, author, and review data from publicly available platforms as source to build RESEARCHBENCH. Paper data collection. We begin by recording the titles of all papers that we plan to crawl. Then, using the arxiv Python package1, we query the arXiv API to check for any papers with identical titles. If match is found, we note the corresponding arXiv ID and use the API to retrieve the papers metadata, including its title, arXiv ID, author list, abstract, and citation information. Author data collection. primary challenge in collecting author data is that there might be multiple human researchers with the same name, and some human researchers may not have any publicly available publication records on public platforms including arXiv, Google Scholar, or Semantic Scholar. As result, at the paper collection stage, we only have each authors name. We use the semanticscholar Python package2 to search for the author by name, verify that they have contributed to the specific target paper, and obtain unique author ID from Semantic Scholar. This ID then allows us to retrieve their available publication information. To prevent information leakage when simulating paper writing and review scenarios, we exclude any of the authors publications released after the target papers publication year. For example, if we target to simulate paper published in 2022, we ignore all of the authors publications appearing after 2022. We also exclude the target paper itself to avoid leaking information. Generally, we limit the maximum number of collected publications to around 20, focusing on those most relevant to the target time frame. Additionally, we gather each authors co-author network and their top publications to enrich the dataset with useful relational information. Review data collection. In addition to paper and author data, we also leverage OpenReview to extract public review information. Since fully public review data is predominantly available for ICLR, we focus on collecting reviews from ICLR2024. Using the openreview Python package3, we first 1https://pypi.org/project/arxiv/ 2https://github.com/danielnsilva/semanticscholar 3https://openreview-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"

The collected review data aligns with ICLRs criteria, including detailed feedback on soundness, presentation, contributions, reviewer scores, and commentary on strengths and weaknesses. We adopt this review structure when generating our reviews, incorporating strengths, weaknesses, and ratings for the paper. D.2 PAPERBENCH TECHNICAL DETAILS PAPERBENCH is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of paper-writing simulations by gathering high-quality paper metadata from top-tier ML conferences, such as NeurIPS 2024 and ICLR 2024. Based on the collected author and paper data, we perform the following two post-processing steps: First, we address cases where authors have no accessible publications beyond the current paper, or where citation data extraction fails due to API issues. In such cases, we exclude these papers. We only retain those with full author publication information, as well as complete metadata including introduction, abstract, title, and citations. After this filtering step, we end up with approximately 1,200 papers and then randomly sample 1,000 from them. Second, to allow more fine-grained analysis, we split these 1,000 paper-writing tasks into three subgroups based on their difficulty level. We use the data-agg settings described in Section 7 to obtain results and compute similarity scores for our simulations. We then divide the dataset into three equal subsets: the worst 333 data points (hard), the middle 334 data points (medium), and the top 333 data points (easy). This results in more granular categorization of the datasets difficulty. Intuitively, papers in the hard sub-part tend to be more theoretical and math-focused, while those in the easy sub-part are more application-oriented. Examples for hard sub-parts of the dataset include Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (Domingo-Enrich et al., 2023), Mixed Dynamics In Linear Networks: Unifying the Lazy and Active Regimes (Tu et al., 2024), and Multistable Shape from Shading Emerges from Patch Diffusion (Han et al., 2024). Examples for easy sub-parts of the dataset include 4Real: Towards Photorealistic 4D Scene Generation via Video Diffusion Models (Yu et al., 2024), Skill Machines: Temporal Logic Skill Composition in Reinforcement Learning (Tasse et al., 2024), and On the Worst Prompt Performance of Large Language Models (Cao et al., 2024). D.3 HIGHIMPACTPAPERBENCH TECHNICAL DETAILS HIGHIMPACTPAPERBENCH serves as an extreme benchmark for RESEARCHTOWN, focused on simulating impactful research. We begin by collecting the 20 most-cited papers from each of 10 leading AI-related conferencesCVPR, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, AAAI, IJCAI, ACL, EMNLP, and NAACLbased on Google Scholar citation rankings.1 Additionally, we include classic machine learning algorithm papers such as those introducing VAE (Kingma, 2013), GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014), and Adam (Kingma, 2014), each with over 1,000 citations, even if they are no longer listed in the current Google Scholar citation rankings. For these impactful papers, it is crucial to prevent the inclusion of publications released after their publication year when gathering authors publication data. Such later works could significantly alter the researchers trajectory, misrepresent the historical context of these influential contributions, and leak information for simulation. After collecting paper and author data, we remove any papers with incomplete information due to crawling errors. From the remaining set, we randomly sample 100 papers to form the final benchmark. These selected papers have averaged over 100 citations in the past five years, ensuring that HIGHIMPACTPAPERBENCH represents collection of influential and well-established research. D.4 REVIEWBENCH TECHNICAL DETAILS Since public review data is only fully accessible from ICLR, we focus on collecting review data for the ICLR 2024 papers included in PAPERBENCH. All reviews are anonymous, so no direct reviewer information is available. To address this, we identify suitable reviewers by first summarizing each researchers publications. We then use the abstract of the target paper as query and the 1https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng"

To ablate the effect of the number of researchers (1 to 5), we select subset from the hard part of PAPERBENCH within RESEARCHBENCH including 333 paper writing tasks, ensuring each paper has more than five authors. This filtering results in subset of 172 paper-writing tasks. We focus on the hard subset because we believe that involving multiple research agents in more challenging scenarios yields more significant difference in performance. Data for paper-writing paper number ablation.. In this ablation, we vary the number of cited papers included in different sections of the target paper. Specifically, we examine citations in the related work, introduction, and other sections. To do this, we retrieve the raw LATEX source from arXiv and extract references at the section level. Due to varying data availability, we finalize subset of RESEARCHBENCH that includes 296 paper-writing tasks for this study. Data for review-writing researcher number ablation..

Here is the publication history of one researcher: Publication1: Learning node embeddings that capture nodes position within the broader graph structure is crucial for many prediction tasks on graphs. However, existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures have limited power in capturing the position/location of given node concerning all other nodes of the graph. Here we propose Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), new class of GNNs for computing position-aware node embeddings. P-GNN first samples sets of anchor nodes computes the distance of given target node to each anchor set, and then learns non-linear distance-weighted aggregation scheme over the anchor sets. This way P-GNNs can capture the positions/locations of nodes concerning the anchor nodes. P-GNNs have several advantages: they are inductive, scalable, and can incorporate node feature information. We apply P-GNNs to multiple prediction tasks including link prediction and community detection. We show that P-GNNs consistently outperform state-of-the-art GNNs, with up to 66% improvement in terms of the ROC AUC score. ... ... Publication8: AutoML has demonstrated remarkable success in finding an effective neural architecture for given machine learning task defined by specific dataset and an evaluation metric. However, most present AutoML techniques consider each task independently from scratch, which requires exploring many architectures, leading to high computational costs. Here we propose AutoTransfer, an AutoML solution that improves search efficiency by transferring the prior architectural design knowledge to the novel task of interest. Our key innovation includes task-model bank that captures the model performance over diverse set of GNN architectures and tasks and computationally efficient task embedding that can accurately measure the similarity among different tasks. Based on the task-model bank and the task embeddings, we estimate the design priors of desirable models of the novel task, by aggregating similarityweighted sum of the top-K design distributions on tasks that are similar to the task of interest. The computed design priors can be used with any AutoML search algorithm. We evaluate AutoTransfer on six datasets in the graph machine learning domain. Experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed task embedding can be computed efficiently and that tasks with similar embeddings have similar best-performing architectures; (ii) AutoTransfer significantly improves search efficiency with the transferred design priors, reducing the number of explored architectures by an order of magnitude. Finally, we release GNNBank-101, large-scale dataset of detailed GNN training information of 120,000 task-model combinations to facilitate and inspire future research.

How can we theoretically establish the benefits of momentum in stochastic gradient descent methods for deep learning, particularly in the presence of stochastic gradient noise? Why is it interesting and important? Why is it hard? Why hasnt it been solved before? What are the key components of my approach and result? Understanding the role of momentum in stochastic optimization is crucial for the research community as it can lead to more stable and efficient training of deep learning models. If we can theoretically prove the advantages of momentum in the presence of noise, it could reshape optimization strategies, leading to faster convergence rates and improved performance in various applications. This advancement could also inspire new methodologies that leverage momentum more effectively, potentially influencing future research directions in optimization techniques. The challenge lies in the inherent stochasticity introduced by mini-batch sampling, which can obscure the true gradient and complicate the analysis of momentums effects. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the noises impact on convergence rates, leading to misleading conclusions. Additionally, the theoretical frameworks established for noiseless scenarios do not directly translate to the stochastic case, creating significant gap in understanding. Overcoming these complexities requires rigorous mathematical analysis and potentially new theoretical tools. Previous research has primarily focused on the noiseless case or has not rigorously analyzed the stochastic setting, leading to gaps in understanding momentums role in noisy environments. Existing studies often conclude that momentum does not provide significant speedup compared to vanilla SGD, but they lack comprehensive theoretical framework that addresses the stochastic nature of deep learning. Our approach aims to fill this gap by providing more nuanced analysis that considers the effects of stochastic gradient noise on momentums performance. Our proposed methodology involves rigorous theoretical analysis of momentum in stochastic gradient descent, utilizing combination of mathematical modeling and empirical validation. We will analyze various datasets to evaluate the performance of standard SGDM against modified versions that account for stochastic noise. The key metrics for evaluation will include convergence rates and stability of training loss. We expect to demonstrate that momentum can indeed stabilize the optimization process and lead to faster convergence in the presence of noise, thereby providing solid theoretical foundation for its use in deep learning. How can we effectively leverage momentumbased optimization methods in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to enhance the generalization performance of deep learning models, particularly when trained on large-scale datasets with noisy labels and large batch sizes? This research is significant as it addresses the growing trend of using large batch sizes in deep learning, which can lead to poorer generalization performance. By improving our understanding of momentum-based methods, we can enhance model robustness and efficiency in real-world applications across various domains, including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. Insights gained could inform future optimization strategies, balancing training efficiency with generalization capabilities. The complexity arises from the intricate dynamics between momentum parameters, learning rates, and the stochastic nature of gradient updates, especially in the presence of noisy labels and large batch sizes. Naive implementations may lead to suboptimal convergence and generalization due to the interaction of these factors. Additionally, the theoretical understanding of momentums effects in non-convex optimization landscapes is still limited, complicating the design of effective algorithms. Previous research has often focused on either the empirical performance of momentum methods or their theoretical foundations in isolation, neglecting the combined effects of noise and batch size on optimization dynamics. Many studies have not adequately explored how momentum can be optimally tuned in noisy environments or how it interacts with varying batch sizes. This gap has hindered comprehensive understanding of momentums role in SGD. propose to develop novel momentum-based optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts momentum parameters based on the noise level in the training data and the batch size. This will involve conducting experiments on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, evaluating performance against standard SGD and existing momentum methods using metrics like accuracy and generalization error. The expected outcome is robust optimization algorithm that demonstrates improved generalization performance and provides practical guidelines for effectively applying momentum in SGD, particularly in challenging training scenarios characterized by noise and largescale data.

How can we efficiently generate high-quality animated 3D assets from monocular videos or text inputs? Why is it interesting and important? Why is it hard? Why hasnt it been solved before? What are the key components of my approach and result? Solving this problem has significant implications for the research community as it addresses the growing demand for automated tools in 3D content creation, which is currently labor-intensive process. By enabling the generation of animated 3D assets from easily accessible data sources, this research could democratize access to 3D modeling, fostering innovation in fields such as gaming, virtual reality, and film. Furthermore, it could lead to advancements in related areas like computer vision and generative modeling, paving the way for future research that explores more complex 4D content editing and real-time applications. The challenges in solving this problem stem from the need for high-quality 4D reconstruction from limited input data, such as monocular videos. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent complexity of accurately capturing temporal dynamics and spatial details from single viewpoint. Additionally, existing methods often rely on extensive multiview data, which is costly and time-consuming to collect. The fragility of score distillation techniques and the computational intensity of current models further complicate the task, necessitating innovative solutions to achieve both speed and quality in 4D reconstruction. Previous research has been limited by the reliance on multiview data, which restricts applicability due to the high costs associated with data collection. Additionally, existing methods, such as video score distillation, are often slow and sensitive to input variations, leading to inconsistent results. The lack of largescale dataset specifically designed for training models on 4D reconstruction has also been barrier. Our approach differs by leveraging new dataset of 12 million multiview videos and introducing feed-forward model that incorporates temporal self-attention, allowing for faster and more reliable 4D reconstruction. Our proposed methodology, L4GM, utilizes large-scale dataset of 12 million multiview videos to train 4D Large Reconstruction Model that reconstructs sequences of 3D Gaussians from monocular video inputs. The model employs temporal self-attention layers to ensure consistency across frames and includes an interpolation model to enhance output frame rates. How can we effectively generate high-fidelity 4D dynamic scenes from monocular video inputs while ensuring spatial-temporal consistency and realistic motion representation? This problem is critical for advancing computer vision and graphics, particularly in applications such as virtual reality, gaming, and film production. By enabling the generation of dynamic 3D scenes from single-view inputs, we can democratize access to high-quality content creation tools, allowing artists and developers to produce immersive experiences without extensive resources. This research could lead to breakthroughs in automated content generation, enhancing user experiences and paving the way for innovations in interactive media and AI-driven storytelling. Generating 4D dynamic scenes from monocular videos is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of single-view data, which limits the ability to accurately infer depth and motion dynamics. The lack of comprehensive datasets and the complexities of ensuring temporal coherence and spatial consistency add further difficulty. Existing methods often struggle with maintaining high visual fidelity while capturing the intricate relationships between appearance and motion, leading to artifacts and inconsistencies in the generated output. Previous research has primarily focused on static scene reconstruction or required multiview inputs, which are not always available in practical scenarios. Techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise but often rely on extensive optimization and multi-view data, limiting their applicability. Additionally, many existing methods do not effectively disentangle motion from appearance, leading to challenges in generating realistic animations. The lack of unified framework that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models has hindered progress in this area. We propose novel two-stage framework that first utilizes 3D-aware image diffusion model to generate high-quality static 3D asset from monocular video input. The second stage will involve optimizing deformable neural radiance field to learn motion dynamics, ensuring temporal coherence and spatial consistency. Our methodology will be evaluated using diverse datasets of monocular videos, employing metrics such as visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and user preference assessments. The expected outcomes include the generation of realistic 4D scenes that maintain highquality visual appearance and coherence across frames, significantly advancing the state-ofthe-art in dynamic scene generation.

Why is it interesting and important? Why is it hard? Why hasnt it been solved before? What are the key components of my approach and result? How can we enhance the robustness of conformal prediction methods against adversarial examples while maintaining computational efficiency? Solving this problem is crucial for the research community as it addresses the growing concern of adversarial attacks on machine learning models, particularly in safety-critical applications. By improving the robustness of conformal prediction, we can ensure more reliable uncertainty quantification, which is essential for decision-making processes in fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. This research could pave the way for future studies that explore more resilient predictive models and lead to practical applications where trustworthiness and safety are paramount. The challenges in solving this problem stem from the inherent complexity of adversarial attacks, which can manipulate model predictions in subtle ways. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the diverse nature of adversarial perturbations, leading to inadequate coverage guarantees. Additionally, the computational overhead associated with randomized smoothing techniques complicates the implementation of robust conformal prediction, as it requires extensive sampling and can significantly increase training time. Overcoming these technical and practical obstacles is essential to develop an effective solution. Previous research has primarily focused on either conformal prediction or adversarial robustness, often treating them as separate domains. Limitations in existing solutions include lack of comprehensive methods that integrate robust conformal prediction with adversarial noise handling. Barriers such as insufficient understanding of the interaction between conformal prediction and adversarial examples have hindered progress. Our approach differs by providing robust conformal training method that does not introduce additional computational costs at test time, thus addressing both robustness and efficiency. Our proposed methodology involves developing robust conformal prediction (RSCP) framework that utilizes randomized smoothing to enhance adversarial robustness. We will employ datasets such as CIFAR10 for evaluation and measure performance using metrics like coverage probability and computational efficiency. The expected outcomes include demonstrating that our RSCP method maintains robust coverage guarantees against adversarial perturbations while minimizing computational overhead during both training and testing phases, thus enabling the use of larger base models without increased costs. How can we develop robust and efficient framework for conformal prediction that maintains valid coverage guarantees in the presence of adversarial perturbations and label noise in machine learning classification tasks? This problem is critical for enhancing the reliability of machine learning models, especially in high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous systems, where incorrect predictions can have severe consequences. By improving conformal prediction methods to effectively handle adversarial conditions and label noise, we can provide more trustworthy uncertainty quantification. This advancement is essential for the practical deployment of AI systems, fostering greater confidence in their predictions and enabling their use in diverse domains like finance, healthcare, and security. The challenge arises from the complexities associated with label noise and adversarial perturbations, which can distort data distributions and violate the assumptions of traditional conformal prediction methods. Existing approaches often fail to account for the adversarial nature of noise or the distribution shifts that occur during inference. Additionally, ensuring valid coverage guarantees while maintaining model performance requires sophisticated techniques that balance robustness and accuracy, complicating the design of effective algorithms. Previous research has largely focused on either conformal prediction under ideal conditions or on adversarial robustness without integrating these two aspects. Many existing methods lack unified framework that effectively combines conformal prediction with robust techniques against label noise and adversarial attacks. The absence of formal guarantees for coverage in the presence of such perturbations has hindered practical applicability, leaving gap that our approach aims to fill. We propose novel framework that integrates probabilistically robust conformal prediction with adversarial training techniques. Our methodology will involve developing an adaptive conformal prediction algorithm that utilizes quantile-of-quantile approach to establish thresholds for both clean and perturbed data. We will evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, using metrics like coverage probability and prediction set size to assess performance. The expected outcomes include improved coverage guarantees under adversarial conditions, reduced prediction set sizes, and enhanced computational efficiency, ultimately leading to more reliable framework for uncertainty quantification in machine learning.

How can we develop model that generates photorealistic images from natural language prompts while maintaining fidelity to the specified content? Solving this problem has significant implications for the research community as it bridges the gap between natural language processing and computer vision, enabling more intuitive and accessible content creation. This advancement could lead to practical applications in various fields, such as digital art, advertising, and education, where users can generate tailored visual content effortlessly. Furthermore, it could inspire future research into more sophisticated generative models that integrate multimodal data, enhancing our understanding of how language and visual perception interact. The challenges in solving this problem include the complexity of accurately interpreting natural language prompts and translating them into detailed visual representations. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent ambiguity in language and the difficulty of capturing intricate details like lighting, shadows, and textures in generated images. Additionally, achieving balance between photorealism and adherence to the prompt requires overcoming technical obstacles related to model training, data representation, and the integration of different generative techniques. Previous research has primarily focused on either generating images from text or achieving photorealism, but not both simultaneously. Limitations in existing models often stem from their inability to effectively combine the strengths of text-conditional and unconditional image generation techniques. Barriers such as insufficient training data, lack of robust evaluation metrics, and the complexity of integrating multiple generative approaches have hindered progress. Our approach aims to address these gaps by leveraging diffusion models, classifier guidance, and CLIP to enhance both the quality and relevance of generated images. Our proposed methodology involves using diffusion models augmented with classifier-free guidance and CLIP for image generation. We will train our model on diverse dataset of images and corresponding text prompts, employing metrics such as Inception Score and Fr00e9chet Inception Distance to evaluate the quality of generated images. The expected outcomes include the generation of high-fidelity images that accurately reflect the content of the prompts, along with improved performance in detecting and filtering out undesired content, such as images containing people, thereby enhancing the models applicability in real-world scenarios. How can we effectively generate highresolution, semantically coherent, and diverse images from textual descriptions while ensuring fairness and reducing computational costs in text-to-image synthesis models? This problem is significant as it bridges the gap between natural language processing and computer vision, enhancing applications in creative industries such as content creation, advertising, and virtual reality. Improving the quality and diversity of generated images can lead to more accurate visual storytelling and better user experiences. Additionally, addressing fairness in AI-generated content is crucial for ethical deployment, ensuring that diverse demographic groups are accurately represented and not perpetuated by biases. The challenges arise from the complexity of aligning nuanced textual descriptions with visual representations, which often leads to issues of semantic drift and loss of detail. Existing models may struggle with maintaining high fidelity and diversity in generated images, particularly when trained on biased datasets that lack representation. Furthermore, the computational demands of current methods can hinder accessibility and scalability, making it difficult to experiment with more efficient training paradigms. Previous research has often focused on improving either the quality of generated images or the alignment between text and images, but few have successfully integrated these aspects into unified framework. Many existing models rely on complex architectures that require extensive labeled datasets and computational resources, limiting their practical application. Additionally, insufficient emphasis on fairness and representation in training datasets has hindered progress in creating inclusive generative models. We propose novel framework that combines Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with contrastive learning techniques to enhance text-to-image synthesis. This approach will utilize balanced dataset that includes diverse demographic representations, focusing on effective text-image feature alignment. We will evaluate our model using metrics such as Inception Score (IS) and Fr00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) to assess both image quality and fairness. The expected outcomes include high-quality, diverse images that accurately reflect the input text while demonstrating equitable performance across various demographic categories, ultimately setting new standard for fairness and efficiency in generative models.

Why is it interesting and important? Why is it hard? Why hasnt it been solved before? What are the key components of my approach and result? The specific research question addressed in this proposal is: How can kinematic modeling techniques from astrophysics be applied to analyze and understand the evolution of writing styles in large-scale linguistic datasets? This research bridges the gap between astrophysics and linguistics, providing novel interdisciplinary approach to studying language evolution. By applying kinematic modeling, we can uncover dynamic shifts in writing styles that may reflect broader cultural and environmental influences. The implications for the research community are profound; this study could lead to new methodologies in linguistic analysis and enhance our understanding of language development across different families. Furthermore, the insights gained could inform practical applications in fields such as computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and artificial intelligence, advancing the understanding of how language adapts and evolves in response to societal changes. Solving this problem presents several challenges. Firstly, the complexity of language is inherently multifaceted, with numerous variables influencing writing styles, including cultural context, authorial intent, and historical events. Traditional linguistic analysis may not adequately capture these dynamic shifts, as they often rely on static models. Moreover, applying astrophysical kinematic models requires deep understanding of both fields, necessitating interdisciplinary expertise. Naive approaches that merely replicate astrophysical models without adapting for linguistic nuances are likely to fail, as they may overlook critical contextual elements. Additionally, the sheer volume of linguistic data presents technical obstacles in terms of data processing and analysis, requiring robust machine learning algorithms to identify and classify transient phenomena accurately. Previous research has largely focused on static analyses of linguistic datasets, often missing the dynamic aspects of language evolution. Existing solutions have been limited by the lack of interdisciplinary approaches that integrate methodologies from other fields, such as astrophysics. Additionally, there has been scarcity of comprehensive datasets that span significant temporal and cultural shifts in language use. Barriers such as insufficient computational resources and the complexity of developing suitable machine learning models have also hindered progress. This proposal distinguishes itself by employing advanced kinematic modeling techniques, which have not been previously applied to linguistic datasets, thus offering fresh perspective and more nuanced understanding of language evolution. The proposed methodology involves developing framework that integrates kinematic modeling techniques with machine learning algorithms to analyze linguistic datasets. We will utilize large-scale corpora from diverse language families, focusing on historical texts to capture changes in syntax, vocabulary, and stylistic elements over time. Specifically, we will adapt kinematic models by defining linguistic velocity metrics that quantify shifts in writing style, analogous to how velocities are analyzed in astrophysics. Key metrics will include the frequency and distribution of linguistic features over time, allowing for the identification of transient phenomena in language use. Expected outcomes include the classification of dynamic shifts in writing styles and the elucidation of relationships between linguistic evolution and cultural or environmental influences. This research aims to produce robust, interdisciplinary framework that enhances our understanding of language dynamics, paving the way for future studies in both linguistics and adjacent fields. Furthermore, we will address ethical considerations by ensuring respectful treatment of historical texts and acknowledging the limitations of drawing parallels between astrophysical phenomena and linguistic evolution.

Why is it interesting and important? Why is it hard? Why hasnt it been solved before? What are the key components of my approach and result? The specific research question aim to address is: How can multimodal large language model that integrates qualitative narrative analysis with real-time speech translation effectively address the communication needs of communities affected by mass incarceration? Solving this problem holds significant implications for both the research community and society at large. The integration of qualitative narrative analysis with real-time speech translation can enhance our understanding of the complex social dynamics and personal experiences of individuals affected by mass incarceration. By capturing and translating haunting narrativesthat reflect the legacies of state violence, this research can contribute to the broader discourse on restorative justice and community resilience. Furthermore, the outcomes of this study could inform emergency response strategies, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive appropriate support during crises. This advancement in knowledge not only has the potential to improve communication practices but also to influence policy and practical applications in social justice and community support initiatives. The challenges in addressing this problem are multifaceted. First, the integration of qualitative narrative analysis with real-time speech translation requires sophisticated algorithms that can accurately interpret and convey nuanced meanings, particularly in emotionally charged narratives. Naive approaches may fail to capture the socio-cultural context essential for effective communication, leading to misinterpretations and potentially harmful consequences. Additionally, there are technical hurdles in processing multimodal data2014combining text, audio, and contextual cues2014while ensuring the model remains sensitive to the lived experiences of marginalized communities. The theoretical complexities of understanding and representing narratives of trauma and resilience further complicate the development of robust model. Previous research has often focused on either qualitative narrative analysis or speech translation in isolation, overlooking the critical intersection of these fields. Existing solutions have been limited by their inability to adapt translations based on socio-cultural contexts, which is vital for accurately conveying personal stories from affected communities. Barriers such as lack of interdisciplinary collaboration and insufficient datasets that reflect the experiences of those impacted by mass incarceration have also hindered progress. My approach differs by explicitly incorporating narrative analysis into the translation process and prioritizing socio-cultural contextualization, thus addressing the gaps in prior work and providing more holistic solution. My proposed methodology involves developing multimodal large language model that utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for narrative analysis and real-time speech translation. will employ mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative data from interviews with impacted individuals and quantitative data from existing linguistic resources.

Why is it interesting and important? Why is it hard? Why hasnt it been solved before? What are the key components of my approach and result? How can we develop an adaptive stochastic optimization framework that effectively solves stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) by integrating concepts from the Adam algorithm, while accommodating time-varying boundary conditions and optimizing numerical methods in real-time? Solving SPDEs is crucial in various fields such as physics, finance, and engineering, where systems are influenced by randomness and uncertainty. An effective framework that adapts to time-varying boundary conditions can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of numerical solutions, leading to deeper insights into the behavior of dynamic systems. This research has the potential to advance the understanding of critical phenomena, such as phase transitions and turbulence, which are vital for modeling real-world scenarios. Moreover, the integration of adaptive stochastic optimization methods and neural architecture search can pave the way for future research by providing versatile toolset that can be applied to wide range of complex problems, ultimately leading to practical applications in predictive modeling and risk assessment. The challenge in addressing SPDEs lies in their inherent complexity and the stochastic nature of the equations, which makes traditional numerical methods often insufficient. Naive approaches may fail due to their inability to adapt to changing conditions or to handle high-dimensional spaces effectively. Additionally, the presence of singularities and complex boundary conditions complicates the mathematical landscape, requiring sophisticated techniques for accurate approximation. The integration of deep learning and adaptive optimization introduces further challenges, such as the need for extensive computational resources and robust training methodologies, which must be carefully designed to ensure convergence and reliability. Specifically, overfitting poses significant concern, as the models performance may degrade when exposed to unseen data or extreme conditions. Previous research on SPDEs has primarily focused on either deterministic methods or has not adequately incorporated adaptive techniques that account for real-time data. Many existing solutions lack the flexibility needed to address the dynamic nature of boundary conditions, leading to limitations in their applicability. Additionally, the integration of deep learning with traditional numerical methods is still an emerging area, with few studies exploring the optimization of neural architectures specifically for SPDEs. My approach distinguishes itself by leveraging the Adam optimization algorithm alongside neural architecture search to create framework that automatically identifies optimal strategies. This integration is crucial as it allows for the real-time adjustment of numerical methods, thus filling the gaps left by prior work and overcoming barriers related to adaptability and efficiency. My proposed methodology involves developing an adaptive stochastic optimization framework that employs the Adam algorithms moment estimation to optimize numerical methods for SPDEs in real-time. The framework will utilize comprehensive dataset of simulated SPDE solutions, incorporating various boundary conditions and singularity scenarios. Key metrics for evaluation will include convergence rates, computational efficiency, and accuracy of the simulations.

This research is significant as it seeks to illuminate the often-overlooked social dynamics that arise in marginalized communities due to mass incarceration. By exploring the concept of ghost networks,this study will provide insights into how invisible social ties and resources can affect community resilience and perceptions of justice. The findings will have broader implications for the research community by advancing knowledge on the interplay between social networks and policing technologies, and their collective impact on community well-being. Moreover, this research could lead to practical applications in criminal justice reform, guiding the development of AI frameworks that prioritize ethical considerations and promote equitable outcomes, thereby influencing future policy decisions and community rehabilitation efforts. Addressing this problem is challenging due to the complexities of social dynamics in marginalized communities, where the effects of mass incarceration and systemic violence create intricate, often hidden networks. Naive approaches may fail to capture the nuanced interactions within these communities, as traditional quantitative methods may overlook the qualitative dimensions of social ties and community resilience. Additionally, there are technical obstacles in accurately mapping these ghost networks, as well as theoretical challenges in integrating social impact metrics with AI applications. The deployment of policing technologies further complicates the landscape, as these tools can exacerbate existing inequalities, making it difficult to disentangle their effects from those of community dynamics. Previous research has often focused on the direct consequences of mass incarceration, neglecting the subtler implications of social networks and the role of policing technologies. Limitations in existing studies include lack of mixed-methods approaches that combine quantitative data with qualitative insights, resulting in an incomplete understanding of community dynamics.

This research is crucial because online toxicity, particularly hate speech and harassment, adversely affects marginalized communities, compounding existing societal inequalities. By developing platform that not only detects and mitigates hate speech in real-time but also integrates user-reported impacts, we can significantly advance the understanding of how digital discourse influences mental health and community dynamics. This study will provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, promoting future investigations into the psychological effects of online interactions and informing interventions that foster inclusivity. The anticipated outcomes include comprehensive dataset that captures the multifaceted impacts of online toxicity, which could lead to innovative machine learning models and strategies for creating safer online environments. Solving this problem involves several complexities. First, accurately detecting and categorizing online toxicity is challenging due to the nuanced nature of language, context, and cultural differences. Naive approaches that rely solely on keyword filtering may fail to capture the subtleties of hate speech, leading to false negatives or positives. Additionally, understanding the psychological and societal impacts requires robust qualitative data from affected individuals, which is difficult to obtain and analyze systematically. There are also technical hurdles in integrating diverse datasets, ensuring user privacy, and developing machine learning models that can effectively contextualize and respond to the unique experiences of marginalized groups. Previous research has primarily focused on either automated hate speech detection or the psychological impacts of online toxicity, often in isolation. There is notable gap in interdisciplinary approaches that combine these perspectives while specifically addressing marginalized communities. Existing solutions have been limited by lack of comprehensive datasets that reflect both the historical narratives of systemic violence and contemporary online interactions.

Second, the environmental stressors affecting hybridization dynamics in the Viburnum clade are multifaceted, making it difficult to isolate specific genetic markers linked to adaptive traits. Naive approaches may fail because they often overlook the intricate relationships between genetic, ecological, and astronomical factors. Additionally, ensuring that the genomic data accurately reflects the phenotypic adaptations observed in response to celestial measurements demands robust validation methods that can bridge both domains, which is significant technical challenge. Previous research has largely focused on either genomic studies of plant species or the calibration of celestial measurements, with limited interdisciplinary efforts to merge these areas. significant gap exists in understanding how ecological pressures influence genetic adaptations and how these adaptations can be quantitatively linked to systematic errors in astrometric measurements. Barriers such as lack of integrated datasets and the absence of frameworks that facilitate cross-disciplinary analysis have hindered progress. My approach differs from prior work by explicitly connecting genetic markers and environmental stressors to astrometric calibration, utilizing machine learning to uncover patterns that have previously gone unexamined. The absence of clear framework for quantitative integration of these domains has also contributed to the lack of progress in this area. My proposed methodology involves multi-step framework that includes: (1) collecting genomic data from various Viburnum species, focusing on environmental stressors that influence hybridization dynamics, with stratified sampling strategy to ensure representation across different habitats; (2) employing advanced machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines, tailored to handle the high dimensionality and sparsity of genomic data; (3) correlating identified genetic markers with systematic errors in astrometric measurements using celestial mapping datasets, while addressing potential challenges related to data quality and availability; and (4) validating the findings through robust statistical methods, including cross-validation and permutation tests, to ensure that the identified genetic markers are indeed linked to adaptive traits.
