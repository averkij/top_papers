            "content": "Recent large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) and O1 (OpenAI et al., 2024b), have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across complex mathematical and scientific domains (Chen et al., 2025). Emerging research (Strachan et al., 2024; Mittelstädt et al., 2024) further highlights their promising (cid:66)Corresponding author (zhangkaipeng@pjlab.org.cn).

The system constructs subject-specific strategy profile from observer-mode data and applies it to participantmode gameplay, supported by dual-layer annotations. Four cognitively motivated tasks assess the models ability to apply individualized reasoning styles. performance in human-centric tasks, including social commonsense inference, intention recognition, and belief attribution. Beyond these capabilities, recent studies suggest that LLMs may exhibit early signs of Theory of Mind (ToM)the ability to represent and reason about others beliefs, desires, and intentions (Sarıtas et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2025). Understanding and evaluating such high-level cognitive traits is critical for advancing LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI), and potentially, artificial superintelligence. Existing benchmarks attempt to assess ToMlike reasoning through tasks such as intent classification (Liu et al., 2024), false-belief attribution (Huang, 2024), and multiple-choice social inference (Seo et al., 2024). However, these methods primarily target output plausibility or behavioral consistency, offering limited insight into underlying cognitive mechanisms, especially those that vary across individuals. In practice, different people often exhibit context-sensitive preferences in subjective scenarios and may arrive at similar conclusions via distinct reasoning trajectories (Otto et al., 2022; Charpentier et al., 2024). We refer to this as an individualized reasoning style. Social deduction games (SDGs) become an ideal evaluation scenario for internalizing and applying reasoning styles, where players must infer the hidden mental states of others and make strategic decisions accordingly (Zhang et al., 2025; Yoo and Kim, 2024). Due to their dynamic, adversarial and individualized nature (Feng et al., 2024), such settings require more than surface-level alignment: if an LLM cannot capture and adapt to players individualized reasoning style, even plausible output may not support meaningful collaboration. Bridging this gap is essential for advancing ToM-inspired modeling of individual variation in reasoning, and for building LLMs capable of personalized, adaptive inference. We identify two key challenges: (1) how to capture and represent individualized reasoning processes, which may require structured interaction settings and cognitively meaningful annotations; (2) how to evaluate whether an LLM can apply learned reasoning style in contextually adaptive ways, which calls for fine-grained, cognitively grounded tasks. To meet these challenges, we propose InMind, cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether LLMs can internalize and apply individualized reasoning styles through SDGs. As illustrated in Figure 1, InMind introduces two complementary gameplay modes: Observer, where subject reasons passively from the perspective of another player without acting, and Participant, where the subject actively engages in gameplay from their own perspective. This setup not only supports the natural capture of individualized reasoning, but also enables its application and evaluation in dynamic, interactive contexts. Crucially, InMind integrates dual-layer cognitive annotations: (1) strategy traces, which capture real-time reasoning signals such as belief updates, intention inference, and counterfactual thinking; and (2) reflective summaries, offering post-hoc insights that contextualize key game events and assess the behaviors and intentions of other players. Leveraging these signals, InMind defines four cognitively motivated tasks to evaluate distinct aspects of individualized reasoning. (1) Player Identification tests whether model can recognize behavioral patterns that align with specific reasoning style. (2) Reflection Alignment assesses the models ability to ground abstract post-game reflections in concrete game behavior. (3) Trace Attribution probes whether the model can simulate evolving, in-context reasoning across time. (4) Role Inference evaluates whether the model can internalize reasoning styles to support belief modeling under uncertainty. To concretely investigate these capabilities, we instantiate InMind within the popular social deduction game Avalon1, creating InMind-Avalon, novel dataset comprising 30 full-session human gameplays annotated with detailed cognitive traces and reflective summaries. Our empirical analysis evaluates 11 state-of-the-art LLMs on AvalonInMind and highlights several critical limitations: (1) Most models, including GPT-4o, heavily rely on superficial lexical patterns, failing to consistently infer deeper strategic intent; (2) Temporal alignment between reflective reasoning and specific in-game events remains challenging for nearly all evaluated models; (3) Dynamic adaptation of strategic reasoning based on evolving interactions is largely insufficient, indicating fundamental shortcomings in models capability for individualized reasoning. Nevertheless, we observe promising potential in certain models, such as DeepSeek-R1, suggesting possible avenues for improvement. Despite the inherent subjectivity in individualized annotations, these cognitively grounded traces and reflections effectively facilitate fine-grained tasks like hidden role identification, highlighting their practical utility for model training and evaluation. In summary, our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce InMind, cognitively grounded evaluation framework specifically designed to assess individualized reasoning and strategic adaptation of LLMs in dynamic social deduction scenarios; (2) We release InMind-Avalon, novel annotated dataset comprising 30 full-session human gameplay recordings enhanced with detailed cognitive annotations, including real-time strategy traces and reflective summaries; (3)Through extensive evaluation of current state-of-the-art models, we identify critical limitations in temporally structured reasoning, adaptive strategy use, and individualized align1https://avalon-game.com/wiki/rules/ ment. We hope that InMind serves as principled tool to guide future advances toward individualized, adaptive collaboration between humans and AI in socially rich, interactive environments."

            "content": "2.1 Theory of Mind Reasoning in LLMs Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) increasingly demonstrate capabilities aligned with Theory of Mind (ToM), including false-belief attribution, intention recognition, and motivational reasoning (Kim et al., 2025; Sarıtas et al., 2025), which suggest that LLMs can approximate certain aspects of social cognition. Several benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate these faculties, such as Social IQa (Sap et al., 2019), KoCommonGEN (Seo et al., 2024), and OpenToM (Xu et al., 2024), which typically use multiple-choice or context-driven tasks. More recent approaches incorporate dialog-based (Yu et al., 2025) and reinforcement learning settings (Lu et al., 2025) to explore deeper social reasoning. However, most benchmarks focus on output plausibility and offer limited visibility into the reasoning process itself. By contrast, the proposed InMind framework builds on these discussions and explicitly identifies two core limitations: the lack of temporal structure in evaluating reasoning over time, and the failure to distinguish between surface behavior and underlying cognition."

While several studies have utilized such environments to assess LLMs performance in role identification, belief tracking, and deception detection (Light et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2025; Chi et al., 2024), most of them fail to provide structured representations of the cognitive processes involved in gameplay. Although some efforts (Stepputtis et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024) introduce temporal and intentionaware evaluations, they still fall short in providing comprehensive or individualized annotations that capture the evolving nature of reasoning within social deduction contexts. In contrast, the InMind framework introduces cognitively annotated interactions across distinct gameplay modes, enabling the capture of individualized reasoning styles and supporting the evaluation of LLMs adaptive capabilities in dynamic social settings."

            "content": "We represent each annotated game session as structured tuple: = mode, A, {Ez}zZ , F. (1) Here, mode {Observer, Participant} denotes the cognitive perspective under which the session was recorded. The role assignment is defined as = (p1, r1), ..., (pn, rn), where each player pi is assigned hidden role ri. The game unfolds over rounds = z1, ..., zm, with each round represented by an event tuple Ez = Uz, Gz, Sz. Moreover, Uz contains all player utterances and system messages; Gz records the observable game state (e.g., team proposals, votes, mission outcomes); and Sz captures the subjects real-time strategy trace, including their beliefs, intentions, and inferences. Upon game completion, the subject provides reflective summary that articulates post-hoc reasoning, identifies pivotal moments, and evaluates other players behavior. Together, the strategy trace Sz and the reflective summary constitute the dual-layer cognitive supervision central to InMind. To simplify notation, we use superscripts and to indicate whether variable comes from an Observer-mode or Participant-mode session. Both modes share the same data structure, the key In distinction lies in the subjects perspective. Observer-mode, the subject does not take any actions but instead reasons from the perspective of designated player. This setup helps the model disentangle strategic reasoning from observed surface behavior. In Participant-mode, the subject actively engages in the game and provides annotations from their own point of view. 3.2 Evaluation Protocol The evaluation protocol of InMind consists of two stages: Capturing Individual Reasoning Styles and Applying Profile in Adaptive Tasks, as depicted in Algorithm 1. In Stage 1, it constructs subjectspecific reasoning profile to capture individual cognitive tendencies from Observer-mode gameplay, independent of overt behavior. In Stage 2, this profile is applied to set of downstream reasoning tasks to evaluate the models ability to simulate and adapt to the subjects decision-making style."

            "content": "The goal of this stage is to derive concise yet expressive profile that captures the subjects unique reasoning tendencies. Rather than relying on explicit in-game actions, this process draws from Observer-mode gameplay, in which the subject reasons aloud from the perspective of designated player without taking any actions themselves. This design helps isolate cognitive patterns from behavioral noise, allowing for more faithful reconstruction of individual reasoning styles. To construct the profile, we apply structured prompt (ProfilePrompt) over the subjects full Observer-mode session Go. The prompt instructs the model to identify recurring interpretive strategies, decision heuristics, and evaluative criteria based on the subjects commentary. The output is free-form textual summary that encapsulates how the subject tends to perceive, process, and respond to gameplay dynamics. This profile serves as static cognitive signature, reused across all downstream evaluations to assess how well models internalize and adapt to human reasoning. Algorithm 1: InMind Evaluation Protocol Input: Go, Gp, Tasks Output: Results // Stage 1: Build subject-specific strategy profile 1 LLM(ProfilePrompt(Go)) // Stage 2: Apply profile to each task 2 foreach do // Construct task-specific context and targets (C, ) ConstructTask(Gp, S, ) // Generate prediction via formatted prompt ˆY LLM(FormatPrompt(C, )) // Compute evaluation result Eval( ˆY , ) 3 4 5 Observer-mode data, to simulate the subjects reasoning in novel gameplay contexts. Given the profile and new Participant-mode session Gp, the model is prompted to generate inferences that align with the subjects cognitive style. InMind transforms naturalistic annotations into structured prediction tasks by capitalizing on the inherently player-centric structure of social deduction games (SDGs). Since reasoning in SDGs is organized around individual players and their interactions, most annotations are naturally linked to specific player IDs (e.g., P1P6). This structure allows cognitive traces and post-hoc reflections to be reformulated as clearly defined prediction problems. To this end, we introduce four such tasks, including player identification, reflection alignment, trace attribution, and role inference. All tasks are formulated as predictions over player identities or roles. Their configurations are summarized in Table 1. (1) Player Identification. Given subjectspecific strategy profile and participant-mode session Gp (with all player identities anonymized), the model is tasked with identifying which players in-game behavior best aligns with the subjects reasoning style. It produces ranked list of candidates, and evaluation is based on Top-k accuracy (typically = 1, 3). This task measures static cognitive alignment between the profile and observed gameplay. Inputs include all player utterances and strategy traces, but exclude role assignments and game outcomes."

Static tasks are presented as full-game contexts. Dynamic tasks reveal gameplay incrementally and require the model to summarize prior context, simulating human reasoning under limited memory and partial recall. reflection F, written by the subject, primarily comprises two forms of reasoning: (1) recalling specific moment that affected the games trajectory (e.g., Player 1 deceived Player 5 about mission sabotage), and (2) offering abstract evaluations of others based on global impressions (e.g., Player 3 never voiced doubt, probably hiding something, which compresses multi-round silence into single attribution). These reflections are typically temporally unanchored and do not reference specific rounds, posing challenges for grounding. We mask player IDs mentioned in and prompt the model to fill them in based on the full session Gp and the subject profile S. Performance is evaluated using exact-match accuracy, where prediction is considered correct only if all masked player IDs in are accurately recovered. (3) Trace Attribution. This task assesses whether LLMs can simulate subjects evolving reasoning trajectory across rounds of gameplay. Each round-level trace Sz reflects how the subject interprets recent events, including factual observations (e.g., P3s last statement came across as overly eager), identity attributions (e.g., suspect P2 is Evil), and intended next moves (e.g., Ill accuse P4 next to test their reaction). To evaluate this capability, we mask all player IDs in Sz and prompt the model to recover them incrementally(one round at time), using only prior game context and the subject profile S. Accuracy is measured by exact match. Unlike Task 2, this task requires real-time attribution and adjustment, testing whether models can follow the subjects strategy as it unfolds. (4) Role Inference. This task assesses whether LLMs can extend the subjects reasoning style to perform belief modeling under uncertainty. As the game unfolds, the model must incrementally infer each players hidden role based on partial observations and evolving interactions. At each round, it receives the current game history and outputs full player-to-role mapping. Scoring is weighted toward later rounds to reflect the increasing availability of evidence. The task evaluates whether models can maintain consistency, adapt to new information, and infer the hidden roles 3.3 InMind-Avalon: Case Study The InMind framework is instantiated in the sixplayer version of the social deduction game Avalon, characterized by asymmetric hidden roles and the need for collaborative reasoning under uncertainty. The Good team comprises Merlin, Percival, and two Loyal Servants; the Evil team consists of Morgana and the Assassin. For detailed rules, please refer to Appendix A. We recruited 73 experienced players, one of whom was randomly selected to serve as the subject. This player completed both observer-mode and participant-mode sessions, while other players were resampled per game to ensure strategic diversity. We then conducted all sessions via online voice chat in Mandarin Chinese to preserve authentic communication dynamics. Players frequently used game-specific expressions such as tiao pai, dui tiao, and chong piao, which introduce additional reasoning challenges due to their implicit and context-dependent meanings. We transcribed all speech and comments verbatim, including disfluencies (e.g., pauses, hesitations), in order to preserve the real-time dynamics and interaction patterns of gameplay. To ensure annotation quality, three expert annotators accompanied the subject throughout and provided real-time guidance on producing round-level strategy traces and post-game reflective summaries. All annotations were reviewed for consistency. See Appendix and for details. The resulting dataset is referred to as InMindAvalon, which comprises 30 full game sessions (25 participant-mode, 5 observer-mode), totaling 884 player turns, 160 strategy traces, and 30 reflective summaries. Each session lasts 2025 minutes, with total gameplay exceeding 10 hours. Players are limited to 30 seconds per turn, yielding concise but tactically dense utterances. All canonical roles are well represented across varied team compositions. Notably, 22 games reached the final assassination phase, with Merlin correctly identified in only 41% of cases, highlighting the difficulty of role inference. The subjects team achieved 56% win rate in participant-mode games. Additional statistics are provided in Appendix C. Based on InMind-Avalon, we construct four structured evaluation tasks following the two-stage InMind protocol (Section 3.2): (1) 25 player identification cases, (2) 194 reflection alignment instances, (3) 791 trace attribution queries, and (4) 25 role inference sessions across 93 incremental rounds."

This indicates difficulty in leveraging prior reasoning to inform current predictions. Rather than building on evolving beliefs, models tend to treat each round as an isolated instance, reflecting limited integration of temporal strategy context. These results highlight core limitation in dynamic attribution: current LLMs struggle to track and reproduce individualized reasoning styles over time, making it difficult to maintain coherent, round-by-round inference. 4.5 Role Inference Setup We task the model with inferring the hidden roles of all players from the perspective of designated subject, based on observed gameplay. To examine how contextual cues influence role inference, we vary three factors: (1) whether the prompt adopts first-person or third-person perspective, (2) whether the subjects round-level strategy traces (Sz) are provided, and (3) whether the subjects own role is revealed. These conditions define four prompting modes (AD), summarized in Table 4. Each setting is evaluated under two criteria: strict scoring and relaxed scoring. The former requires the model to accurately identify all five canonical roles, while the latter simplifies the task by grouping roles into three broader categories: Informed Good (Merlin, Percival), Uninformed Good (Loyalists), and Evil (Morgana, Assassin).

Stronger models appear toward the top. prompt perspective from first-person (Mode B) to third-person (Mode C) yields similar results. This suggests that LLMs do not show clear benefit from observer-style prompting, and we do not observe the outsider sees more of the game phenomenon commonly associated with human reasoning. While strict role identification remains challenging for most models, their performance under relaxed scoring demonstrates emerging potential for collaborative inference in social reasoning settings. We also investigate how the subjects role (e.g., Merlin or Percival) shapes the demands placed on reasoning models, as different roles require distinct inference strategies.

All configurations are tested under both strict (exact role) and relaxed (role group) scoring. Results and Analysis Figure 4 and Figure 9(See G.2) show that providing access to strategy traces Sz improves model performance across all prompting configurations. Mode achieves the highest scores under both strict and relaxed conditions, indicating that subjective annotations, even when potentially biased or incomplete, can support more effective role inference. In contrast, shifting the InMind offers novel, cognitively grounded framework for evaluating whether large language models can internalize and apply individualized reasoning styles in complex, interactive settings. By leveraging the structured dynamics of social deduction games and enriching gameplay data with dual-layer annotations from multiple perspectives, InMind enables fine-grained assessment of strategic and adaptive reasoning. Our accompanying dataset, InMind-Avalon, and comprehensive model evaluation reveal key limitations in current LLMs adapting to individualized human reasoning styles. We believe this framework paves the way for more personalized, socially aware AI systems and invites further exploration into cognitive modeling and adaptive collaboration."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "While InMind is designed as general framework for evaluating individualized reasoning in social deduction games, the current implementation focuses exclusively on the Avalon setting. Although Avalon captures many of the strategic and cognitive elements characteristic of SDGs, our experiments do not yet explore other game environments with different social structures or interaction patterns. In future work, we plan to expand both the range of tasks and the scale of the dataset to include additional games such as Blood on the Clocktower, The Resistance and Werewolf, thereby enriching the diversity of reasoning styles and dynamics. Given the inherently subjective nature of individualized reasoning, the annotation process unavoidably reflects annotator preferences and interpretation. Although expert annotators were involved throughout to guide and standardize the process, variation and bias are difficult to eliminate entirely. Expanding the dataset in both size and diversity will help mitigate such subjectivity and improve the robustness and generalizability of InMind. Moreover, the core ideas behind InMind extend beyond games and hold potential for broader domains such as multi-agent collaboration, negotiation, and human-AI teaming, where personalized, context-sensitive reasoning is essential. Supporting real-time, multi-agent dynamics will be an important step toward evaluating and enhancing LLMs in more complex, socially situated environments."

            "title": "A Game Setting and Terminology",
            "content": "A.1 Avalon Setup and Roles In the InMind-Avalon dataset, all sessions follow the 6-player variant of Avalon, featuring asymmetric roles and hidden identities. The game consists of two opposing teams: Good team (4 players): Merlin, Percival, and two Loyal Servants; Evil team (2 players): Morgana and the Assassin. Table 5 summarizes the visibility structure among roles. Merlin. Knows the identities of all evil players, but must avoid revealing this knowledge. Typically hides among loyal players and subtly steers team decisions. Percival. Is informed that two players are Merlin and Morgana but does not know who is who. Aims to distinguish the real Merlin and support them covertly. Loyal Servant. Has no knowledge of roles. Relies purely on reasoning and observation. Must avoid overexposing suspicion to protect Merlins cover. Morgana. Pretends to be Merlin to confuse Percival and manipulate good players. May mislead, mimic, or publicly claim roles to create chaos. Assassin. Knows Morganas identity. Remains hidden, tracks likely Merlin candidates, and ultimately attempts to assassinate Merlin if the good side wins. A.2 Game Flow Avalon proceeds through series of up to 5 missions, each comprising three stages: Team Formation. Each round begins with designated leader proposing team for the mission. Players then speak in turn to express their stance, analyze the game state, and (optionally) make role claims. Finally, all players vote on the proposed team. If the vote passes by majority, the team proceeds. Otherwise, leadership passes to the next player. If five consecutive votes fail, the evil team wins by default (forced vote rule). Mission Execution. Selected team members privately vote success or fail. Good players must vote success, while evil players may vote either way. mission fails if at least one player chooses fail. Mission team sizes by round are fixed: 23-4-3-4 (total of 5 missions). Team composition influences deduction dynamics. Victory Conditions. The first team to win three missions wins the game. If the good team wins three missions, the Assassin is given one opportunity to identify Merlin. If correct, the evil team wins; otherwise, the good team wins. In special cases, the evil team may knife Merlin early if both evil players agree, resulting in an immediate win upon success. A.3 On Preserving Chinese Terminology All data in InMind-Avalon is collected from live Chinese-language gameplay and annotation. We intentionally preserve core in-game terms in Chinese for two reasons: Many phrases (e.g., 跳派, 踩, 拱) carry cultural or strategic nuance not captured by direct translation. Retaining these terms enhances reproducibility and supports linguistic fidelity during model training and evaluation. table 6 provides key terminology used throughout the dataset, with English explanations."

Reviewing Reflective Summaries (F) Reflective summaries should capture global reasoning across the session. Reviewers should: Ensure the subject reflects on at least 23 major moments (e.g., turning points, team shifts, hidden role reveals). Encourage inclusion of both accurate and mistaken judgments. Highlight inconsistencies between reflection and trace progression (e.g., player previously trusted is now judged negatively without explanation). Ask for clarification when post-hoc evaluations are too vague or unsupported. 示例原始: 1 表现很像狼 建议修改: 1 第三轮突然强跳派还踩了4但第四轮又 改口说4 很像好人这种转变让我觉得很狼 (1 suddenly claimed to be Percival in Round 3 and attacked 4, but in Round 4 praised 4 this shift made me suspicious.)"

            "content": "1. Reasoning Style The player demonstrates structured 3D reasoning model, integrating utterance content, player position, and factional gain. For example, they infer the 612316 chain to identify double spies. They also apply backward reasoning from outcomes (e.g., Merlins survival) and frequently rank possibilities using probability weights (e.g., Merlin 40% / Morgana 60%). 2. Discourse Pattern This player compresses information using technical terms (drain, vision card), follows threephase speaking pattern (phenomenon reasoning strategy), and prefers hedging (if were, might be) or strong certainty words (must have) depending on rhetorical intent. Uncertain data is softened via maybe and similar terms (appearing in 78% of utterances). 3. Situation Modeling and Strategy Their identification matrix uses four axes: speech timing, team vote paradoxes, information overload suspicion, and protective camouflage. Suspicion is ranked by conflict signals, abnormal data, mismatched benefit, and positional anomalies. Strategic execution follows phases: early-stage cognitive disruption, mid-stage logic anchoring, and endgame ambiguity retention for post-hoc justification. 4. Behavioral Prediction Average utterance is 5070 characters in the first 3 rounds, typically with 1 claim + 2 supports + 1 question. Voting dissent rate is 65%, particularly against end-position teams. As good role, concealment success is 82% before round 3; as Merlin, exposure risk rises by round 2 due to overprotectiveness. Linguistic fingerprint includes rhetorical questions, 3.2 average usage of drain, and number pattern sensitivity (e.g., 16, 23). Behavioral fingerprint includes delayed first-round speech (avg. 7.3s), opposition to end-slot teams, and silence after mission success. Overall, this player acts as strategic observersubtle early, assertive later.

            "content": "1. Reasoning Style - Logical Inference: Shows strong deductive skill in identifying traps and inconsistencies from others speech and behavior. - Attention to Verbal Detail: Highly sensitive to timing, tone, and diction of others speech, often using it to infer strategic intent. - Interpersonal Observation: Observes micro-interactions and emotional cues for hidden alignment signals. - Situation Assessment: Evaluates risks and role distributions by integrating task outcomes, speech directionality, and key events. 2. Speaking Pattern - Brevity: Utterances are short and to the point. - Language Style: Uses rational and objective language; avoids emotional or speculative tones. - Information Sharing: Offers selected, high-utility evidence to guide interpretation. - Caution in Commitment: Reluctant to take side without solid justification; avoids premature exposure. 3. Strategic Judgment - Indicators of Alignment: (1) Logical coherence or contradiction in speech; (2) Behavioral anomalies or stance switching; (3) Emotional volatility at pivotal moments; (4) Correlation between mission outcomes and behavioral choices. - Ambiguity Handling: - Actively seeks more evidence; - Considers multiple plausible scenarios; - Maintains neutrality when insufficient data. - Team Guidance: - Uses questions to elicit useful information; - Shares reasoning to support collective understanding; - Proposes actionable plans in high-stakes moments. 4. Summary This player is precise, analytical, and communicative. Their reasoning centers on rational judgment and behavioral signals, allowing them to detect inconsistencies and track alignment shifts quickly.

            "content": "G.1 Impact of Prior Trace Inputs To assess the utility of temporally grounded reasoning inputs, we analyze model performance on the trace attribution task with and without access to the prior rounds strategy trace. This comparison reveals whether models can effectively incorporate evolving belief states to support context-sensitive inference. Figure 8: Bar height reflects the change in accuracy when providing the prior trace as input. Positive values indicate successful adaptation to evolving reasoning. G.2 Extended Analysis of Prompting Modes and Roles We further investigate how prompting configurations and subject roles modulate model performance. Prompting modes (AD) vary in the form and granularity of cognitive supervision, ranging from minimal cues to explicit strategy traces. Subject roles differ in informational asymmetry and strategic responsibility, thereby shaping the complexity of the underlying reasoning process. This analysis provides additional insight into the interplay between input structure and reasoning demand. G.3 Model Accuracy by Subject Role Figure 10 further examines model performance by the subjects initial role. Even when playing as Merlin( with full knowledge of Evil players), strict prediction accuracy remains low, likely due to the need for concealment. Mode performs better in most role conditions, suggesting that strategy traces contribute transferable reasoning signals. This supports the broader utility of cognitively grounded supervision for inferring hidden roles in complex social environments. Figure 9: Bars show average performance and standard deviation across all models, grouped by prompting mode and scoring criterion. Figure 10: We compare model performance when the subject plays different roles (Merlin, Percival, Loyalist, etc.). Only Modes AC are included, since Mode omits role information.

You accused me of being Morgana as soon as you spoke is this how good guy plays? If you had insight, Id understand, but youre acting like loyal subject and messing around. Arent you clearly suspect?

Ill continue to act like loyal subject causing disruption if Im not on the four-person team, must oppose it and just cooperate with my teammates.

Ill continue to play dumb and act like loyal subject who cant see the situation clearly. Since Player 3 opposed their own suggested team of 1, 3, 4, 6, Ill use that to claim Player 3 is targeting Player 6 and work with my teammate to discredit Player 6. Both Player 1 and Player 3 seem like theyre eliminating suspects randomly, and Player 4 is voting aggressively from outside the team someone should accuse them. Task 4 Round 1 [System Message] 中文6号玩家是队长他初步选择的队伍是:4,5,6 EnglishPlayer 6 is the captain, and the team he initially selected is: 4, 5, 6.

When you formed the team, was being vouched for, but you left me out, and everyone followed your \"insight\" to attack me. Now the team failed lets see how you explain this. If you cant identify the traitor, Ill mark you as definite traitor. Player 5, the only purpose of failed team is to identify traitors. If you form another failed team without identifying anyone, Im calling you traitor. [Player 1] 中文45开一张126开一张我还是保着3打136吧你要信我136你不信我拉倒 EnglishTheres one traitor in 4 and 5, and one in 1, 2, 6. still trust Player 3 lets go with 1, 3, 6. Believe me or not, up to you.

So Player 3 must be good guy. With two failed missions already, if Player 3 were traitor, Merlin wouldnt protect them. So Player 3 must be on the team. Player 2 agreed to 1, 3, 6 and accused 4 and 5 of being traitors that makes Player 2 traitor. [Player 6] 中文那你5号就认匪吧你到现在你就点不出匪那你就认匪吧 EnglishThen just admit youre traitor, Player 5. You still cant identify any traitors, so you must be one. [System Message] 中文6号玩家是队长他最终选择的队伍是:2,4,6 EnglishPlayer 6 is the captain, and the team he finally selected is: 2, 4, 6.

If someone suspects me, theyll think Im blindly following, but those who trust me will see Im just loyal subject without insight, just targeting Player 5. Player 6 included me in the team, but Player 4 opposed it from outside Player 4 feels like Merlin. Player 6 doesnt seem like an insight holder. Since Im on the team, Ill definitely agree to push for it. Its fine for my teammate Player 5 to attack me and oppose the team. Round 2 [System Message] 中文1号玩家是队长他初步选择的队伍是:1,3,6 EnglishPlayer 1 is the captain, and the team he initially selected is: 1, 3, 6. [Player 1] 中文你再怎么带也不能那么带啊你这个车你起码还有点逻辑对吧你带那个车一点 逻辑没有啊 EnglishNo matter how you form the team, you cant do it like that. At least this team has some logic, right? The other team had no logic at all.

Theres one traitor on the team and one off the team voting against it. Theyre trying to trick us into failed mission. We should reject it and only form the 3, 4, 5 team. [Player 6] 中文炸三塔那不就你5号干的事吗你开这个炸车然后呢你又组不出队又连匪 都指不出来那你说你是干什么就是尽干匪事是吧4号是4号一直没上过车为什 么4号没人带这也是个问题啊这个车我肯定不同意啊 EnglishWasnt it you, Player 5, who caused the third mission to fail? You formed failed team, cant organize valid team, and cant identify traitors. What else would that be but traitorous behavior?

Earlier, trusted Player 3, and Player 3 trusted Player 2, so followed. But after Player 2 attacked everyone targeting Player 3, me (Player 1), and then 4 and 5 cant trust Player 2 anymore. Player 5 previously accused 4 and 5 of being traitors but now wants to include Player 4? Im out. Ill form different team and not join this one.

But this makes me look more like clueless loyal subject. Why does Player 1 trust Player 6 so easily? Player 3 and 6 seem like theyre randomly eliminating suspects. Player 1 and 4 are likely Merlin or Percival. For the 3, 4, 6 team, only Players 1 and 5 agreed from outside. My teammate is probably intentionally following the vote since theyre almost confirmed as traitor. Ill cooperate and keep attacking Player 1.

Player 4 hasnt been on any team yet, and the missions failed. dont get why youre targeting Player 4. Ive trusted Player 4 as good guy from the start and vouched for them, right? Player 4 is good. Player 1 said they thought Player 4 and 5 were double traitors are you kidding? The 1, 2, 6 team failed, and youre blaming 4 and 5?

Player 3 is definitely good. Player 5s logic is flawed theyve vouched for Players 2, 3, and me (Player 1) before, then attacked Player 6, caused their team to fail, and now are protecting Player 1 and 4 while ignoring Player 6. Theyve vouched for four people! [Player 2] 中文5号确实定匪了但那我只能是2346我一张好人牌啊那只能打15双匪虽 然1的这个让车有点习惯但可能掩饰一下吧 EnglishPlayer 5 is definitely traitor.

Player 3 seems overwhelmed and is randomly eliminating suspects. Im not sure if Player 1 is self-exposing as Merlin, but if they insist theres traitor in 4 and 5, its likely theyre marking 4 or 5 as traitors maybe Merlin and Percival switched identities. Even though wasnt on the last-minute team change, think Merlin has revealed themselves. Ill vote yes to confuse others, lower my profile, and help my teammate accuse me of blindly following. If the team forms, whatever. If Players 3 and 6 both oppose 1, 3, 4, 6, they might be randomly eliminating suspects.
