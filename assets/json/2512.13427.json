            "content": "Text-to-Image (TTI) models generate realistic images according to natural text prompt. Recent years have seen significant progress in the perceptual quality of the images they generate as well as in the adherence of those images to the text prompts. However, despite substantial progress in these two aspects, state-of-the-art models often fall short of expectations when examining the semantic diversity of the outputs they generate for each prompt  (Fig. 1)  , resulting in gap between humanexpected and model-generated diversity. This gap can introduce prejudiced perspectives, as TTI models learn from datasets that have been shown to embed sociodemographic biases (Birhane et al., 2021; Garcia et al., 2023), leading to the generation of images that reflect or even amplify these biases (Bianchi et al., 2023; Cho et al., 2023). Recent work has taken broader view by developing methods for detecting open-set biases, surfacing previously unexplored forms of bias. These include analyzing bias for specific prompt (Chinchure et al., 2025), specific concept (Rassin et al., 2024), or larger set of given captions (DInc`a et al., 2024). In this work, we build on these efforts by moving beyond the evaluation of TTI model on limited set of prompts or concepts. We introduce MINETHEGAP, method that automatically mines the vast textual space of valid prompts to find those that cause TTI model to produce biased outputs. MINETHEGAP is genetic algorithm based optimization process, that leverages Large Language Model (LLM). Initially, the LLM is used to generate set of random candidate prompts for the TTI model, forming the initial population for optimization. Then, at each iteration, all prompts in the current population are measured for bias using our proposed bias score, and the prompts on which the model is found to be most biased are used to generate the population of the next iteration. Upon termination, the most biased prompts are presented to the user. Mining biased prompts requires bias measure that ranks prompts from the entire prompt space, that vary substantially in their semantics. Prior approaches are limited to quantifying bias along specific axes, regardless if these are predefined as is typical in studies of sociodemographic biases, or proposed on the fly using LLMs. While such methods have advanced open-set bias detection, they do"

These prompts, identified by MINETHEGAP, introduce bias in the generated images. In contrast, the bottom panel presents 3 images retrieved through Google Photos search, illustrating alternative interpretations of the same prompt. not provide unified way to evaluate the overall bias of prompt across multiple, potentially interacting axes. To overcome this restriction, we introduce novel measure that compares the semantic distribution of generated images to an intended distribution of plausible interpretations. Since this intended distribution is fundamentally unobservable, we approximate it by sampling diverse textual variations from an LLM, shifting the focus from fixed axes to range of semantic interpretations. Consider, for example, the prompt photo of nurse, for which 20 images generated by three TTI models are shown in Fig. 2, alongside images generated from textual variations that span additional semantic options. All models exhibit bias by predominantly producing female figures, and further deviations emerge, as the vast majority of images generated by Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1 (Rombach et al., 2022) appear in grayscale, while FLUX.1 Schnell (forest labs, 2025) frequently depicts nurses wearing masks. Measuring these deviations and applying appropriate normalization, allows us to rank bias severity across prompts, as we validate on dataset with known biases. This guides our prompt mining process. While our approach operates in open-set scenarios, we also demonstrate how it can be tailored to target specific types of bias. Automatically uncovering biased prompts highlights model deficiencies in provoking biases, and should lead to further understanding of how to train and use the model when aiming for results that are both fair and beneficial for the user. To summarize, this work makes two key contributions: (i) It introduces an automatic method for revealing biased prompts in TTI models, enabling the discovery of both well-known and previously unseen open-set biases. (ii) It proposes new bias measure that moves beyond axis-based approaches, which depend on defined attributes and categories. Instead, our bias measure compares the distribution of generated images to that of plausible textual variations of prompt, efficiently capturing deviations from the expected distribution."

Regardless of the detection method, recent advancements enable their mitigation (Kim et al., 2024; Parihar et al., 2024). Closest to our work is DInc`a et al. (2024) which introduces pipeline for evaluating open-set biases in TTI models, applied on set of real textual captions, such that the evaluated biases depend on this set of captions and are restricted to it. Our method complements these efforts by proposing an automatic method for identifying prompts that cause TTI model to generate biased outputs, from the unconstrained textual prompt space. This is achieved without relying on predefined captions, concepts, or specific bias categories, yet it can also be adapted to target them when desired. Genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms are gradient-free optimization processes where population of candidate solutions iteratively improves by selecting the best candidates to generate the next population. They have been widely applied to prompt optimization tasks (Xu et al., 2022; Tanaka et al., 2023; He et al., 2024), including in the context of TTI models, where they are used to refine prompts for improved image quality and text-image consistency (Pavlichenko & Ustalov, 2023; Tran et al., 2023; Manas et al., 2024). Broadly speaking, these methods remain within constrained search space refining given prompt. Our approach differs by searching the entire prompt space of TTI models to uncover prompts that inherently induce biased outputs of the TTI model."

Since the space of prompts is nondifferentiable, we formulate this as gradient-free optimization problem, refining population of candidate prompts through iterative selection and mutation. In this section we introduce our general framework for optimizing over , which is applicable to any objective. Section 4 discusses our proposed bias objective, used throughout the paper. Our algorithm employs an evolutionary search procedure that iteratively refines population of prompts by selecting those that expose significant bias while introducing new candidates to maintain exploration. The optimization runs for fixed number of iterations, where at each iteration the best prompts are compared to the best prompts found thus far, such that the final output consists of the top prompts identified during the entire process. Figure 3 shows the population of prompts across three iterations, illustrating how the search evolves. The framework consists of the following steps. Initial population. The optimization begins with an initial population of diverse prompts, designed to broadly cover the space of possible biases. Ideally, this population approximates uniform . To generate such set, we instruct an LLM to return sample from the space of valid prompts, candidate prompts in single query. These are then parsed and used as the starting population."

In iteration k, we rank the population from the previous iteration (represented by the sentences in the 1) and select the top-ranked (shown in the green frame). orange and purple frames at iteration We then generate mutations for each of the top-ranked sentences and add random sentences to form the next population. This process repeats in the subsequent iteration +1. Throughout all iterations, sentences are retained in the top prompts bucket if their loss improves on previous top prompts. Selection. To identify the fittest prompts in each iteration, we rank them according to an objective function that quantifies the property of interest. Our framework is independent of the objective used, however for mining biases, we apply the objective defined in Sec. 4.1. This function scores each prompt, where lower values indicate stronger presence of bias. Since the goal is to mine prompts that best optimize this objective, the prompts with the lowest scores are selected for further refinement, serving as the foundation for the next generation of prompts. Figure 3 illustrates the selection when = 2 prompts are carried over to the next iteration (top ranked panel). Mutation. After selecting the most relevant prompts, mutation step generates new candidates by exploring diverse modifications to these prompts. Unlike simple rephrasings, these modifications introduce changes that should lead to visually distinct outputs. To achieve this, an LLM is instructed to generate new modifications for each selected prompt which maintain some connection to the original prompt but allow for creative exploration through substitutions of subjects, omissions, or modifications that significantly alter the expected visual result. For example, given the prompt doctor, the LLM may generate related but distinct concepts such as nurse or dentist, as illustrated in App. C.2. The mutation pane of each iteration in Fig. 3 shows the newly generated mutations, with arrows pointing from each top-ranked prompt to its corresponding = 2 mutations. In high-dimensional search spaces such as Random candidate injection. , genetic algorithms might converge to suboptimal solutions if the population becomes too homogeneous. To avoid this, we inject additional randomly generated prompts at each iteration. These candidates, generated independently by the LLM, introduce genetic diversity into the population and allow the algorithm to explore more areas of the solution space. Since we use the same population size in each iteration, the number of random candidates to inject, denoted by r, is given by = m. As mentioned above, our optimization (i.e., mining) procedure is generic in that it can work with any loss, not necessarily only with bias scores. In App. we illustrate this optimization method on the simple task of mining prompts that produce red, blue, and green images. In this example, the loss being minimized is the mean squared error (MSE) between the generated images and synthetic image of the target color. In this simple setting, our algorithm typically converges in four iterations."

This score should reflect the extent to which the TTI model exhibits bias when generating images for that prompt. Traditional methods for ranking prompts according to the bias they exhibit, either focus on predefined biases or on LLM generated potential biases, and examine the distribution of images for each class associated with the bias. Here, we propose an efficient, fully automatic approach that does not require specifying the nature of the bias in advance and provides an interpretable ranking of prompts."

In the more biased example, we observe gaps in alignment, where certain textual variations fail to find well-matching images. In contrast, the less biased example demonstrates more varied distribution of similarity scores, indicating that the TTI model successfully spans the range of plausible interpretations. We set α = 20th percentile which results in taking the minimum over the maximum similarities. key challenge in quantifying bias is determining the expected image distribution for given prompt. Ideally, we would want to compare with human-expected distribution, which is unknown. To address this, we leverage an LLM to approximate the expected variations in how given prompt could be interpreted. Specifically, we use the LLM to generate set of diverse textual variations of the prompt, designed to span its possible ambiguities. Unlike the mutation step in the mining process, which aims to refine candidate prompts, this process explicitly models the different plausible meanings embedded within single prompt, providing reference for evaluating the TTI models outputs. Examples of textual variations and how they differ from the mutations are given in App. C. 4.1 MEASURING BIAS THROUGH LEAST-ALIGNED ELEMENTS { v1, = , vN = , and variations Given prompt p, we generate images using TTI model, , where corresponds to the number of images of the prompt using an LLM, } the user wishes to evaluate for each prompt. We then embed both sets into shared latent space, and compare their distributions. If the set of generated images fails to span the diversity of the textual variations, then this suggests that the model is biased towards certain interpretations of the prompt. To quantify the gap between the two distributions, we construct an similarity matrix between the two sets of embeddings, such that element Si,j measures the similarity between the ith text variation and the jth generated image, as visualized in Fig. 4. We then construct our bias score (where lower means more biased) as the combination of two complementary scores, as follows. , IN I1, } { The missed visual concepts score measures how well the generated images cover the diversity of the textual interpretations. For each textual variation, we identify the image most aligned to it by taking the maximum similarity score across all images. Namely, for the ith text variation, we compute maxj Si,j. text that is represented in the visual domain has at least one image strongly aligned with it. Now, we want no more than α percent of the text variations to have low maximal alignment scores. We therefore compute the lower αth percentile of these maximum scores, Qα . } The essence of this hyper parameter is to control the sensitivity of the overlap between the two distributions being compared. Setting it to zero enforces strict requirement that every textual variation must be represented in the images, while increasing its value gradually relaxes this constraint by allowing limited number of semantic concepts to differ between the text variations and the images. Similarly, the least-aligned images score measures how well each generated image aligns with the maxj Si,j {"

For each image, we compute the maximum similarity across all textual variations, identifying the closest matching text. Namely, for the jth image, we compute maxi Si,j. Again, we extract the lower αth percentile among these maxima, Qα , as an indication for the images that have no strong correspondence to any textual interpretation. This identifies cases where the TTI model generates images that do not align with reasonable textual variations, indicating bias. maxi Si,j } { Finally, to obtain single relative bias score, we take the average of the missed visual concepts score and the least-aligned images score, and normalize by the mean similarity across the entire matrix, bias = 1 2 (Qα { maxj Si,j } (cid:80) + Qα { i,j Si,j 1 2 maxi Si,j ) } . (1) The normalization is needed because the absolute similarity values are meaningful only when comparing semantically close objects. But across different prompts, we are mainly interested in capturing variance within the matrix, rather than absolute magnitudes. This objective provides single ranking criterion that reflects the severity of bias in the interpretation of TTI model of given prompt, and is used in the selection phase of our optimization process. Inherent explainability. The objective described above has an implicit advantage, which is its inherent ability to communicate to user the source of the bias. This is achieved by identifying the missing visual concepts in the textual variations, and the least-aligned images among the generated outputs. An example is given in the bottom part of Fig. 4 for both high and low bias scores. 4.2 VALIDATING OUR BIAS SCORE To validate our bias score, we assess its ability to capture known biases in TTI models. It is well established that these models often generate stereotypical representations of professions, associating certain occupations with specific genders or ethnicities. primary source of this phenomenon stems from real-world demographic imbalances that are manifested in the datasets used for training. Previously, Luccioni et al. (2024) demonstrated that bias in TTI models can be quantitatively ranked and compared to ground-truth occupational statistics, such as those from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Their method focuses on societal biases (e.g., gender and race) and shows correlation between the ranks assigned by their bias detection framework and the actual gender majority in each profession. Inspired by their evaluation, we apply our bias ranking on the same dataset and evaluate it against the ground-truth majority demographic for each occupation. Specifically, we use set of images generated by SD 1.4 with the prompt Photo portrait of where is profession taken from the BLS (see more details in Luccioni et al. (2024)). Then, we generate 15 variations for each prompt through Cartesian combination of gender and race attributes. All images and"

For both purposes, we use Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024; Meta-AI, 2024) as the core LLM. Comparisons to LLaDA 8B-Instruct (Nie et al., 2025) and Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024) are reported in App. D.1, showing the prompts mined by different LLMs are relatively similar while they differ from captions from COCO. We refer to the prompts used to instruct the LLM on the various tasks as meta-prompts and list them in App. C.1. We experiment with four TTI models: SD 1.4, SD 2.1 (Rombach et al., 2022), SD 3 (Esser et al., 2024), and FLUX.1 Schnell (forest labs, 2025), while also showing qualitative results for Qwen-Image (Wu et al., 2025) in App. D. Implementation details. The optimization process runs with population size of = 15 prompts per iteration, each limited to eight words. At each step, the top = 5 most biased prompts (according to our score) are selected, and each of them undergoes = 2 mutations. To complete the quota, = 5 random prompts are injected in each iteration. To ensure robustness in our findings, we run 50 independent mining processes per model, each starting with different randomly sampled initial population using seeds 0 through 49. When calculating the bias score, we generate = 15 images and text variations for each prompt. The least-aligned images score and missed visual concepts score are computed using the 4th smallest similarity value from the ordered set of 15, corresponding to approximately the 25th percentile. We provide ablations of these design choices in App. A.1. Mining open-set biases. Figure 7 shows qualitative results of images generated with mined prompts. For each prompt, we also present visualization of the text variations that attained the lowest alignment score (i.e., the lower αth percentile of similarity scores), by showing images generated by the TTI model for those texts. These examples highlight cases in which the model produces biased outputs, repeating semantic options where other visual concepts are applicable. Furthermore, it is evident that when the TTI model is fed with the textual variation as the prompt, it does generate images that depict the additional concepts. This indicates that even though the TTI model is capable of generating images that exhibit wide range of interpretations to the prompt, it is often biased towards specific interpretations. Appendix presents additional results, providing broader perspective on the types of prompts identified as biased. To illustrate the mining process, Fig. 8 shows segment of an optimization, plotting candidate prompt scores across iterations to highlight how the process refines the prompt pool toward increasingly biased prompts. To assess the effectiveness of the optimization process, we compare the bias scores of prompts mined by multiple runs of MINETHEGAP to those of randomly sampled prompts from the initial population, and to captions from COCO (Lin et al., 2014). As shown in Fig. S2, mined prompts consistently attain lower losses, indicating that they induce stronger bias according to our metric. Furthermore, the variance in bias scores is significantly smaller for mined prompts, suggesting that the genetic search strategy converges to stable set of highly biased prompts."

Interestingly, we show that by simply adjusting the meta-prompts of the LLM, we can restrict MINETHEGAP to detect biases of particular type or on specific subjects.

We generate images for the biased prompts mined for each model using all other models and compute their respective bias scores.

Nonetheless, bias scores remain relatively low even when examining the mined prompts on other models, suggesting that similar types of biases exist in all evaluated models. Additionally, global ranking of the models emerges based on their average bias scores.

When analyzing questions individually, only four out of 40 questions had majority vote for the mined prompt.

Setting-related categories appear most frequently across models. Figure 13: Comparison with OpenBias. Person-related queries (gender, activity, age) cannot be answered when no person is present, and food type is already specified in the prompt. In contrast, our concepts (identity, location) are more diverse and reveal the underlying bias. across the categories, where setting related categories are most frequent, followed by nature related ones. Style related categories are less frequent, yet App. D.2 demonstrates that prompts that exhibit such biases could also be mined when targeted directly. We refer to App. C.4 for further details. Comparison to OpenBias (DInc`a et al., 2024). OpenBias detects biases in TTI models by generating bias proposals for given set of captions, asking closed-set VQA questions, and aggregating responses across related images. This approach misses biases that are difficult to define or query, but which our mining process does surface. For example, the bias proposals for The person is holding hot dog with onions on it focus on the person, and are thus irrelevant when no person appears in the images  (Fig. 13)  . In contrast, our missed visual concepts focus on the location or on the (in)existence of child, and thus expose more relevant bias in the prompt. Running the full OpenBias pipeline on our mined prompts in App. D.3 further confirms these shortcomings. Quantitative comparisons evaluating OpenBias against our method in the BLS setting show that by using VQA-based gender classification, OpenBias yields Spearman correlation of ρ = 0.64, which is below our ρ = 0.72."

            "content": "We proposed MINETHEGAP, method for automatic discovery of prompts that lead given TTI model to produce biased outputs. The results highlight how these models tend to favor certain interpretations while overlooking alternative, yet equally valid, visual representations. By leveraging an LLM-driven approach to explore the space of prompts and measure bias in gradient-free manner, our method successfully optimizes for prompts that elicit systematically biased outputs. Having the ability to find these biases automatically should foster the development of TTI models that produce more fair, diverse and creative generations, ultimately enhancing the users experience. limitation of our approach is that it relies on an LLM to approximate the target distribution, which itself might be biased. We attempt to reduce bias by instructing the LLM to span ambiguities, yet bias may still remain. Additionally, we measure the gap between the textual and visual distributions using CLIP similarity, restricting the analysis to features it is sensitive to. Our design choices aim to mitigate this, comparing against explicit textual variations (e.g., female doctor) rather than the prompt itself (e.g., doctor), pushing CLIP to differentiate between concrete alternatives. We believe that better LLMs and better text-vision models may help overcome both these limitations."

            "content": "To illustrate the convergence behavior of our optimization method, we apply it to simplified task where the objective is to generate images dominated by specific color: red, blue, or green. In this setting, the loss function is defined as the mean squared error between the generated image and synthetic image of the target color. The meta-prompts used to guide the LLM remain unchanged from our standard mining procedure. Figure S1 shows the image with the lowest MSE at each iteration step. Notably, within just three to four iterations, the optimization converges to prompts that yield the desired color, visually demonstrating the efficiency and generality of the method beyond bias discovery. Figure S1: Convergence of the mining procedure on synthetic task. For each iteration, the best (lowest loss) image is shown. The optimization minimizes the MSE between generated image and solid color image (blue, red, or green). Within four iterations, the method reliably finds prompts that produce images dominated by the target color. To further assess the effectiveness of our optimization process, we analyze the bias scores of prompts mined using MINETHEGAP compared to randomly generated prompts from the initial population, and to captions from COCO (Lin et al., 2014). As illustrated in Fig. S2, the mined prompts consistently achieve lower bias scores, demonstrating that our method successfully identifies prompts that elicit stronger biases from the model. In addition to lower scores, the mined prompts exhibit reduced variance across runs, suggesting that the optimization converges toward stable set of highbias prompts. To strengthen this analysis we report an experiment in which, instead of optimizing, we instruct an LLM to generate 15 new random prompts at each of the 25 iterations. This process is repeated 10 times for each of the four TTI models and the mean over the best loss achieved at each iteration is reported in Fig. S3. Plotting this baseline against the curve of averaging 10 mining processes for each model shows that mining achieves consistently lower losses, indicating its effectiveness in uncovering biased prompts and its superiority over evaluating disjoint random sets. A.1 ABLATION STUDY ON OPTIMIZATION HYPER-PARAMETERS To evaluate how the composition of the prompt population influences the mining process, we performed an ablation study on the key hyper-parameters that define it at each iteration: the number of selected prompts s, the number of mutations per selected prompt m, and the number of randomly injected prompts r, which is determined by the constraint = 15 m, given fixed batch size of = 15. Table S1 reports the average loss and standard deviation for five configurations across four TTI models, with each configuration averaged over 10 runs. Across all models, the five configurations produced broadly similar performance, with FLUX.1 Schnell achieving lowest losses under the setting without random candidate injection. For consistency, however, we adopt the third configuration (s = 5, = 2, = 5) throughout the paper, as it strikes balance between exploiting promising prompts and exploring new regions of the prompt space."

While larger populations evaluate more candidates per iteration, allowing the optimization to identify lower-loss (more biased) prompts earlier in the process, evaluating more candidates increases the total number of NFEs. Fig. S5 illustrates the effect of the hyperparameter α, which controls the sensitivity of the overlap between semantic concepts in the set of generated images, and the set of textual interpretations of the prompt, when both are embedded into mutual embedding space. Lower values of α inherently produce lower losses, as taking lower percentiles of the similarity scores mechanically reduces the loss, independent of the bias. Consequently, evaluating this hyper-parameter solely based on the loss would be uninformative, and instead we report in Fig. S5 the Pearson correlation between the score differences for two prompts that were shown together in question in our user study (described in the main text) and the fraction of participants who choose the corresponding prompt as showing more bias. The correlation remains positive across values with peak when using the 25th percentile, which is the setting used throughout the paper, suggesting strongest fit to human perceived bias.

Specifically, we sampled 45 random prompts and, for each, generated two sets of 15 images driven by the same random seeds, one using the standard sampling procedure and another using the CADS sampler. We then computed our bias score for both sets based on the same set of LLM-generated textual variations. This experiment was performed on both SD 1.4 and SD 2.1. As shown in Fig. S7, the CADS-generated images received higher (i.e., less biased) average scores for SD 1.4, further supporting the validity of our metric. For SD 2.1 the trend is less prominent, aligning with the fact that CADS leads to smaller semantic modifications for this model, as seen in Fig. S8. Figure S7: Validating the bias loss with CADS sampling. Box plots of bias scores for images generated by Stable Diffusion 1.4 and 2.1 for random prompts, with and without CADS. CADS sampling, which is known to increase diversity, is seen to increases the scores (i.e., lowers measured bias), supporting that our metric captures bias. To complement the quantitative CADS evaluation, Fig. S8 presents qualitative examples illustrating the effect of CADS on the diversity of generated outputs. For both SD 1.4 and SD 2.1 models, we show three prompts for which 15 images were generated both with and without the CADS scheduler, using identical seeds for fair comparison. These examples visually demonstrate how CADS increases output variability, particularly for SD 1.4. In contrast, SD 2.1 shows less noticeable improvement in semantic diversity, consistent with the smaller differences in bias scores observed in the quantitative results."

System prompt The same system prompt is used for all configurations: You are creative Python assistant that generates lists of sentences in the format sentence 1, sentence 2, ...]. Always output answers with correct syntax, formatted exactly as requested. No preambles or postambles. Do not include newline characters (n) in the generated output.

To illustrate how our method identifies missed visual concepts, we present in Fig. S9 images generated by four TTI models to the prompt photo of doctor, evaluated with the variations presented above. For FLUX.1 Schnell, none of the generated images depict female doctor. This concept is present in the textual variations but absent from the images, and it is highlighted as missed visual concept. In contrast, the image sets produced by the other three TTI models each include at least one depiction of female doctor. For these models, other semantic aspects from the textual variations that fail to appear in the images are surfaced instead. Examples include the absence of patient interacting with the doctor or the lack of an emergencyroom setting. These findings illustrate how the method adapts, by identifying concepts that are absent in the image set, relative to the variation set.

S11 to S14. In addition, we present qualitative results for prompts mined for Qwen-Image (Wu et al., 2025) in Fig. S10. Each figure shows representative set of mined prompts, where for each prompt we present two sets of 15 generated images. The top row, titled Mined, displays 15 images generated by the TTI model to the mined prompt using different random seeds. These reflect the inherent diversity (or lack thereof) in the models generations for the prompt. The bottom row, titled Variations, shows 15 images generated using the variations of the same prompt generated by Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct for calculating our bias score. These represent additional plausible interpretations of the original prompt. Comparing these rows gives visual assessment of the extent to which the models generations align with the semantic space of valid interpretations. Across models, we observe that the top rows often display limited visual diversity or focus on narrow aspects of the prompt, while the bottom rows contain more varied outputs - indicating missed visual concepts in the native generations of the model. Figure S15 shows word clouds generated from the 50 most biased prompts mined for each of the four TTI models. These visualizations illustrate common terms that tend to induce biased or non-diverse outputs, revealing tendencies towards words related to nature such as field and forest. Targeting longer prompts. Prompt length plays an important role in the expected level of bias, as the more specific or detailed prompt is, the less room there is for interpretation hence biases. While our framework is independent of the length of the prompt, to better surface general biases, we deliberately targeted relatively short prompts. Nevertheless, since in the variation phase the LLM is instructed to explore any ambiguity remaining in the prompt when generating variations, it naturally adapts to aspects left unspecified. Fig. S16 shows prompts discovered when applying MINETHEGAP when relaxing the constraint on the length of the prompt from eight to 30 words. Supplementary t-SNE visualizations. To improve visibility of the images overlaid in the t-SNE visualization in Fig. 2, we provide larger versions of the same images.

For each run, we use the = 5 most biased prompts, yielding 100 prompts per LLM. As baseline, we also sample 100 captions from COCO. We embed all four sets (Qwen-mined, Llama-mined, LLaDA-mined, COCO captions) using CLIP and compute the mean nearest-neighbor cosine similarity between every pair of sets, as reported in Fig. S19. We find that prompts mined by the three LLMs are more similar to each other than to random captions from COCO. To further analyze the distributions, in Fig. S20 we project the CLIP embeddings of all sets into 2D using t-SNE.

            "content": "D.2 MINING SPECIFIC BIASES To qualitatively demonstrate that MINETHEGAP can uncover particular types of bias, we adjusted the meta-prompts guiding the LLM used during the mining process. Specifically, for the discovery of sociodemograohic biases, while generating random prompts and prompt mutations we instructed the LLM (Llama 3.18BInstruct) to depict people (e.g., their roles, activities, professions, or social interactions). For generating the corresponding prompt variations, the meta-prompt instructs to retain the original meaning of the prompt but explicitly vary aspects such as gender, race, and age. This focused prompting allows our method to target specific sociodemographic biases. Figure S21 illustrates two examples of mined prompts: the left pane shows outputs generated by SD 2.1 for mined prompt depicting firefighter, while the right pane shows SD 1.4 generating images of toddler. All images of the firefighter depict male figures, while all toddlers are Caucasian with lightcolored hair. In contrast, the associated prompt variations generated by the LLM exhibit greater sociodemographic diversity, including female figures and various ages and races. Figure S21: Sociodemographic bias. By controlling the meta prompts used for Llama 3.1-8BInstruct, we manage to capture specific biases such as gender and race. On the left pane, all images show male firefighter although the prompt is gender-free. On the right pane, all images show Caucasian toddler. The variations, on the other hand, are much more diverse including female firefighter, toddler of Asian decent, and toddler with curly brown hair. Figure S22 presents four examples of prompts that illustrate targeting additional specific biases. To surface biases of specific object categories, the LLM was instructed to generate prompts that include an adequate object in both random and mutations phases, and instructed to vary features of the object and its setting during the textual variations phase. For bias in the style of the outputs, only the meta-prompt instructing to generate variations differs from the open-set setting, asking to explore different image styles. Independent runs were conducted on general objects, food items, clothing, and image styles, and Fig. S22 mentions the setting each shown prompt was mined for. Thanks to the prompt variations which exhibit greater diversity under each subject, we manage to capture these biased prompts, highlighting the flexibility of our method in automatically mining specific kinds of representational biases when desired."

            "content": "D.3 SUPPLEMENTARY RESULTS FOR THE COMPARISON WITH OPENBIAS We provide additional qualitative comparisons with OpenBias. Figure S23 presents captions from COCO that were marked to exhibit high biases according to our bias score, while OpenBias failed to surface their biases. For example, in the prompt young boy with face paint all over his face, OpenBias proposed bias candidates related to the paint color as well as the childs gender and age. The VQA responses for the color candidates were nearly uniform, masking any detectable bias, and the age or race of the child could not be reliably inferred by the VQA. In contrast, our method generates diverse prompt variations such as specific signs or distinctive face paint patterns that expose the underlying bias more effectively, including: young boy with face paint and big sign that says happy birthday young boy with face paint and big bow tie and suspenders young boy with face paint resembling tigers stripes young boy with face paint and matching hat and cloak similar pattern appears for the prompt person wears purple and black striped socks. OpenBias proposed only the sock color as bias candidate and queried the VQA to decide whether the socks were purple or black. Our approach, however, produces more diverse variations that reveal richer bias cues and enable capturing the bias of showing only the socks. These variations include: person wears purple and black stripes socks while holding coffee cup person wearing purple and black stripes socks is looking at phones person wearing purple and black stripes socks is standing in front of building person wearing purple and black stripes socks is standing on mountain trail We further evaluate OpenBias on prompts mined using MINETHEGAP, to evaluate the extent to which it agrees on the presence of bias. Using our method, we extract 50 mined prompts from each model (SD 1.4, SD 2.1, SD 3, and FLUX.1 Schnell) and provide them as input to OpenBias. Across these 200 textual prompts, OpenBias concludes the bias proposal stage with 19 unique bias names. Figure S24 illustrates several captions that OpenBias fails to identify as biased. Consider the prompt hedgehog nestled in handwoven rattan basket. OpenBias initially proposed the animal type and basket material as bias candidates but discarded them as integral parts of the caption. Our method, by contrast, generates diverse visual concepts that surface hidden biases, including: hedgehog snuggled in handwoven rattan storage basket in rustic cabin hedgehog in handwoven rattan planter basket surrounded by succulents hedgehog nestled in handwoven rattan picnic basket on rocky outcropping hedgehog in handwoven rattan planter basket on stone wall with ivy Finally, for the caption lioness walking in tall grass, OpenBias proposed bias candidates such as the animal itself, the grass height, and the color of the animal. These questions were difficult for the VQA to answer, and the visual similarity across images further obscured the bias. Our method again exposes richer variations, for example: lioness strolling in landscape of tall grass lioness walking in grassy savannah of tall grass lioness navigating through thick stand of tall grass lioness moving through sea of tall grass"
