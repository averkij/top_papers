            "content": "Neural semantic word vector space models represent each word with real-valued vector called word embedding. One widely used set of word embeddings are the GloVe word embeddings introduced by Pennington et al. (2014). This algorithm leverages global cooccurrence matrix built with focus on local context. The GloVe model trains on this global matrix with the resulting weights being the word embeddings in which similar words are grouped closer together in the vector space. The resulting word embeddings encode semantic relationships in dense vector space, making them useful for various NLP tasks. Despite the rise of transformer-based models, pre-trained static embeddings like GloVe remain valuable for low-resource settings, computationally effi1 cient models, and interpretability-focused applications. Our motivations for updating the word embeddings with more recent data are that new words have emerged and existing words have shifted semantic meaning since the original training in 2014. For example, covid does not have representation in the 2014 embeddings. Embeddings with this updated lexicon have many benefits when used in downstream tasks such as reducing out-of-vocabulary issues. In order to reflect the current usage of English words, new embeddings trained on recent language are needed. In this work, we incorporate Minimum Frequency Threshold (MFT) into the vocabulary selection process for training updated word embeddings, building on insights from the work on GloVe-V (Vallebueno et al., 2024). The use of an MFT allows us to strike balance between filtering out excessively rare and noisy words while retaining less frequent but contextually important terms. The GloVe-V framework extends this approach by introducing statistical uncertainty estimates, which account for variability in embedding positions due to data sparsity. This enables training word vectors that are not only robust and expressive but also better suited for downstream tasks where rare words often hold critical importance, ensuring adaptability to modern language usage (Vallebueno et al., 2024). Through this paper, we detail the exact training procedures and demonstrate that the 2024 word embeddings have an updated lexicon reflecting todays language usage and cultural trends. They perform comparably to the 2014 embeddings on word analogy and similarity tasks, indicating similar structural and core semantic expressiveness. Furthermore, the 2024 embeddings show improved performance on temporally dependent Named Entity Recognition (NER) datasets. In this report, we first describe the training data used to create two different sets of word embeddings, including the chosen corpora and preprocessing steps. Then, we outline the training process for easy reproducibility. Finally, we present evaluation metrics for the embeddings, including new vocabulary coverage, direct evaluation, and performance in downstream tasks."

For the 2024 embeddings, we use 3 corpora to train 2 sets of embeddings: Wikipedia, Gigaword, and Dolma. For ample comparison to the 2014 Wikipedia and Gigaword embeddings, we adopt the same corpora with an updated Wikipedia dump. The Wikipedia corpus, dataset of Wikipedia articles, is useful source for word definitions in more naturally occurring environment than, say, dictionary. Along with Wikipedia, Gigaword (Parker et al., 2011) was used. Specifically for the 2024 vectors, we used the 5th edition of Gigaword. This corpus consists of English newswire from 4 to 7 distinct international news outlets (depending on the year) between 19942010. Since 2014, the Wikipedia dumps have roughly doubled in the number of tokens. To rebalance this growth, we put two copies of Gigaword in the training corpus. In addition to the aforementioned corpora, we also utilize Dolma v1.6 (Soldaini et al., 2024). This corpus, which was released in January of 2024, consists of 3 trillion tokens from books, programming scripts, reference materials, scholarly articles, and online content.

The data was then extracted using WikiExtractor (Attardi, 2015). The Wikipedia data was cleaned by removing tags such as <doc> and <unk> tokens. The data was preprocessed using Stanfords CoreNLP tokenizer (version 4.4.1)1 using lowercase letters. The Wikipedia and Gigaword corpora were then merged with Gigaword being included twice. Together, this corpus is about 60GB with Gigaword accounting for about 74% and Wikipedia accounting for the rest. The vocabulary size for the Wiki/Giga vectors was selected following the methodology outlined by Vallebueno et al. (2024). Specifically, the size of the vocabulary was determined by setting MFT for words to be included in 1https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/ tokenizer.html 2 the corpus. Through experiments with vectors trained using different MFTs, it was observed that an MFT of 20 yielded the highest average cosine similarity between the trained vectors and their Weighted Least Squares (WLS) vectors. high cosine similarity with the WLS vectors indicates that the trained embeddings closely align with the statistically optimal solution derived from the cooccurrence matrix, reflecting robust and accurate word representations (Vallebueno et al., 2024). For this corpus, using an MFT of 20 resulted in vocabulary size of 1,291,146 words. 3.2 Corpus #2: Dolma Like the other corpora, we preprocessed using Stanfords CoreNLP tokenizer in the same manner. After preprocessing, we removed <unk> tokens. maximum vocabulary size of 1.2 million was used. The vocabulary building process was done independently on the different subsets of Dolma and merged at the end to have 1.2 million vocabulary size. Further, the cooccurrence matrix was created by merging the cooccurrence matrices on the merged vocabulary."

The vocabulary size was set to over 1.2 million for the Wikipedia and Gigaword corpus and 1.2 million for the Dolma corpus. symmetric context window of size 10 was used to define cooccurrences. Once the cooccurrence matrix was built, it was shuffled with fixed seed of 123 for the Wiki/Giga matrix and 2024 for Dolma matrix. Embeddings of dimensions 50, 100, 200, and 300 were trained for the Wikipedia and Gigaword corpus, and 300-dimensional embeddings were trained for the Dolma corpus. The embeddings were optimized using GloVes original optimizer, AdaGrad.

By representing the vocabularies as sets, we compute the difference by subtracting the 2014 set from the 2024 set.

For the word analogy task, the goal is to predict fourth word in the analogy format word 1 word 3 : ? and compare it : word 2 :: against gold-standard labeled word to calculate accuracy. We use two benchmark datasets: Google Analogy dataset (Mikolov et al., 2013a), which comprises 8,869 semantic and 10,675 syntactic word pairs. MSR Analogy dataset (Mikolov et al., 2013b), containing 8,000 syntactic word pairs. 3 For the word similarity task, embeddings were evaluated by assigning similarity scores to word pairs and comparing these scores to human-annotated benchmarks. We use three benchmark datasets: WordSim353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001), which contains 353 word pairs classified as highly similar, less similar but related, or unrelated. SimLex999 (Hill et al., 2015), comprising 999 word pairs annotated with semantic similarity scores. MEN (Bruni et al., 2014), which includes 3,000 word pairs annotated with humanjudged relatedness scores.

In this task, tokens in sentence are tagged with predefined entity categories such as persons, locations, organizations, and other proper nouns, enabling structured information extraction from text. For this evaluation, we use Stanfords Stanza NER2 model (Qi et al., 2020), modified to replace the default word embeddings with the ones we trained. We train model for each word embedding and dataset. For NER evaluation, we trained and tested models using three datasets, separately for the 2014 and 2024 embeddings: CoNLL-03: Published in 2003, this dataset includes entities for persons, locations, organizations, and miscellaneous categories (entities not covered by the other categories) (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). CoNLL-PP: An improved version of CoNLL-03 introduced by Liu and Ritter (2023), featuring updated and modernized 2https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/ner. html data. We trained models on CoNLL-03 and evaluated them on the CoNLL-PP test set. English Worldwide Newswire: This dataset, introduced in (Shan et al., 2023), consists of over 1,000 English newswire articles published in 2023. These articles were sourced from 47 countries, excluding American news outlets, to ensure non-Western focus and recent language use. The dataset includes references to major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, providing unique opportunity to evaluate how embeddings trained on pre2020 data (2014 embeddings) generalize to recent contexts. Emerging and Rare entity recognition (WNUT 17): This 6 class dataset by Derczynski et al. (2017) includes entities from user-generated text on platforms such as Youtube, Twitter, and Reddit. The entities are rarer and often unseen, making them challenging even for humans to tag in noisy text. This data aims to improve the detection and classification of uncommon entities in dynamic, real-world text scenarios. The training subsets of these datasets were used to train the models with default parameters and no embedding finetuning or character language modeling, and the dev and test subsets were used for evaluation.

For these datasets, we report test F1 scores on per-entity and per-token basis. The results are summarized in Tables 7, 8, and 9. The results across the four NER datasets demonstrate that the 2024 embeddings generally outperform their 2014 counterparts, with particularly notable improvements on temporally dependent datasets. For the CoNLL datasets in Table 7, the 2024 embeddings perform comparably on CoNLL-03 but show clear advantages on the modernized CoNLL-PP version, with the 2024 50d Wiki/Giga embeddings achieving the highest relative improvement in per-entity scores (83.64 vs. 81.58). On the Worldwide dataset in Table 8, the 2024 embeddings demonstrate consistent improvements across both per-entity and pertoken F1 scores, with the 2024 50d Wiki/Giga embeddings achieving per-entity F1 score of 84.64, significantly outperforming the 82.1 score of their 2014 counterparts. The challenging WNUT17 dataset in Table 9 shows significant drop in overall performance compared to CoNLL and Worldwide (F1 scores ranging between 3040), but the 2024 embeddings consistently outperform their 2014 counterparts, with the 2024 200d Wiki/Giga embeddings achieving the highest per-entity and per-token F1 scores of 37.46 and 35.63, respectively. Across all three datasets, the 2024 embeddings demonstrate the most pronounced gains in lower dimensions, particularly at 50d, where the differences between 2024 and 2014 embeddings are the largest. While higher dimensions (200d and 300d) achieve the best absolute F1 6 scores, the relative gains between 2024 and 2014 embeddings are less pronounced at these dimensions. These trends suggest that the 2024 embeddings perform as well as or better than the 2014 embeddings on datasets that align temporally with their training data, while showing marked improvements on modern, linguistically diverse datasets that better reflect contemporary language usage and cultural trends."

            "content": "The 2024 word embeddings introduce diverse range of new vocabulary that reflects cultural, technological, and linguistic shifts over the past decade, including words associated with globally significant events (covid and brexit), modern slang (brainrot and periodt), emerging technologies (chatgpt and blockchain), and popular products (airpods). While many slang terms are absent from the Wikipedia & Gigaword training data because modern slang takes time to transition from social media to Wikipedia, the diverse Dolma dataset compensates by capturing informal and conversational language. The inclusion of acronyms (idk), linguistic blends (absofreakinglutely), and derivations (retweet) reveals evolving patterns in word formation driven by digital communication and social media. By capturing these shifts, the 2024 embeddings align with current vernacular and offer practical benefits for downstream tasks, such as reducing outof-vocabulary issues in modern datasets, while further exploration of these new words provides opportunities for linguistic and sociological research. In the analogy tasks reported in Table 4, the 2014 embeddings performed slightly better, with minimal differences on the Google dataset (within 0.010.03 accuracy) but larger gaps on the MSR dataset, particularly for lower dimensions where differences reached 0.07 for 100d and 0.03 for 50d embeddings. There were about 1100 instances that the 2014 50d predicted correctly, but the 2024 50d predicted incorrectly. About half of these errors were geography-based (e.g., cairo, egypt : bern, ). The other half is mainly instances in which 2024 embeddings predicted synonym of the golden answer. For example in simple, sim- , the 2024 embeddings predicted pler: cold, cooler instead of colder. Although the 2024 50d embeddings made these mistakes, the 2014 embeddings made these common mistakes as well. There were about 900 instances that the 2024 50d predicted correctly, but the 2014 50d predicted incorrectly. These errors were roughly half geography-based and the other using synonyms (using knows instead of thinks in write, writes : think, ). In the errors of the geography-based ones, the 2024 embeddings do know the right answer, but the closest neighbor wasnt the right answer. For example, the 2024 embeddings do know that Bern is in Switzerland, although sometimes the closest neighbor is not Switzerland. This can be seen in 2024 embeddings not getting kabul, afghanistan : bern, right, but getting cairo, egypt : bern, correct. The same phenomenon was seen in the 2014 embeddings. The MSR dataset errors saw more instances of using synonym in the syntactic word analogies. With this, the 2024 and 2014 embeddings perform roughly the same on the analogy tasks. This equal performance is expected as these tasks primarily rely on syntactic structures and commonly used words, which have remained relatively stable over the past decade. For the word similarity tasks, there were differences in the Spearmans Rank Correlation coefficients between the embeddings. To put these difference in perspective, we looked at the word pairs for which there was difference of 0.3 between the embeddings prediction and the human evaluation (which was scaled to 1 1, instead of 010). For the MEN dataset, there are 70 word pairs where the 2024 300d embeddings predictions fall within the threshold while the 2014 300d embeddings diverge. Conversely, there are 197 word pairs where the 2024 embeddings diverge while the 2014 embeddings remain within the threshold. For the SimLex999 dataset, these numbers are 14 and 43, respectively, and for the WS353 dataset, they are 10 and 24. Comparing the two embedding models on MEN, the 2024 embeddings excel at capturing close synonyms and hypernym-hyponym relations (e.g., cemetery graveyard, stair staircase, ice snow, sea water). In these instances, the 2024 model aligns closely with the high similarity ratings in the dataset, while 7 the 2014 embeddings tend to underestimate their similarity. This suggests that the 2024 embeddings may do more precise job at clustering terms that share core, near-equivalent meanings or clear part-whole relationships. However, there are also cases where 2014 outperforms 2024. These often involve looser thematic or distributional associations, such as color words (blue red, purple yellow) or common everyday items that the dataset treats as reasonably similar by virtue of category or context (e.g., daffodil tulip, puddle splash, chicken lamb, potato tomato). In these scenarios, the 2024 model either overestimates or underestimates similarity, whereas 2014 captures these broader relationships more accurately. On the WS353 dataset, we observe similar pattern to what emerged in previous comparisons. The 2024 embeddings tend to capture near-synonyms and clearly related category pairs more precisely. For instance, pairs such as gem jewel or coast shore have high groundtruth similarity scores that 2024 aligns with closely, whereas the 2014 embeddings underestimate these tight connections. The same holds for other near-synonym or hypernym-hyponym examples like magician wizard or lobster food, suggesting that 2024 more reliably encodes strong, direct lexical relationships. Conversely, 2014 excels with looser or more contextual associations, where the concepts are functionally or thematically related rather than strictly synonymous. For example, plane car or energy laboratory receive moderately high similarity ratings in WS353, reflecting that they share an overarching category or context (transportation, scientific research). The 2024 model underestimates these relationships, implying it is not capturing certain broad or looser conceptual links as well. On SimLex-999, we again see the two models excelling in different areas. The 2024 embeddings struggle with some pairs that share domain or have moderate conceptual overlap, such as disease infection or river sea. Although these pairs are not synonyms, SimLex999 rates them fairly high in similarity, which 2024 underestimates more than 2014 does. Similarly, 2024 sometimes undervalues nearsynonymous verbs (e.g., deserve earn, remain retain, replace restore), suggesting it can lose track of subtle lexical overlaps even though those pairs have significant degree of semantic closeness. Furthermore, in the top ten deviations for the 2024 Dolma 300-dimensional embeddings and the human annotations, all ten examples were the model having high similarity between antonyms (e.g., agree argue). For the 2024 Wiki/Giga 300-dimensional vectors, six out of the 10 were highly similar antonyms with the other 4 being synonyms not being given high enough similarity (e.g., creator maker). Overall, across MEN, WS353, and SimLex999, consistent pattern emerges: the 2024 embeddings are especially good at capturing strong, direct relationships (near-synonyms, hypernym-hyponym links, and part-whole connections) while sometimes underestimating more contextual associations. In contrast, the 2014 embeddings tend to do better on looser thematic or distributional relationships (e.g., color words, shared domains, functional overlaps) but occasionally fail on the most obvious, high-similarity pairs like strict synonyms. In contrast to the direct evaluation results where it was not clear which embedding performed better, the NER evaluations reveal the 2024 embeddings outperforming the 2014 embeddings on newer and out-of-domain datasets. On the classic 2003 CoNLL dataset, the results are nearly identical, suggesting that 2014 embeddings remain sufficient for corpora that mirror their original training domain and era. However, on CoNLL-PP and the newer Worldwide and WNUT-17 datasets, the 2024 embeddings show consistent improvements. An inspection of the confusion matrices helps illuminate why 2024 embeddings perform better on more recent data. For example, Table 12 highlights how the 2024-based model reduces misclassifications of newly prominent entities into the (no entity) category or the wrong type (e.g., labeling COVID-19 as O). Instead, the updated embeddings capture contemporary terms and are thus more likely to assign them correct tags, often MISC, rather than leaving them unlabeled or confusing them with LOC, ORG, or PER. Similarly, in Table 13, we see that the 2024 model is less likely to confuse non-Western person names with locations, NER WNUT-17 Confusion Matrix tp CORP CORP CREATIVE-WRK GROUP LOC PER PROD 58 0 CREATIVE-WRK 26 1 1 2 186 61 6 0 0 39 3 2 2 1 7 7 0 35 1 Table 10: 2024/2014 300d Wiki/Giga confusion matrix differences on the WNUT-17 test set GROUP LOC PER PROD 18 6 8 1 16 5 8 1 2 3 4 10 11 1 2 7 4 4 15 7 8 5 3 1 1 5 10 Example NER Tagging Sentence His repeated questioning of the system has prompted the Supreme Court to open an investigation into Bolsonaro.

The second example, coming from CoNLLPP shows 2024 correctly labeling COVID-19, while the 2014 embeddings did not label it. This is case in which word that is part of recent usage should be correctly tagged. The 3Thank you Twemoji for the emojis! last example from WNUT-17 shows how difficult the dataset is for tagging. Despite this, the 2024 model was able to see that finna is slang and did not tag it, although the 2014 model tagged it as person. This is an example of the 2024 embeddings better capturing colloquial vernacular. Overall, we see that the 2024 embeddings better represent current language usage, compared to the 2014 embeddings. In situations where there is temporal dependency (e.g., chatbots, NER taggers, etc.), the 2024 embeddings should be used."

            "content": "We presented new GloVe word embeddings, introducing two sets of vectors trained on updated corpora from Wikipedia, Gigaword, and subset of Dolma. These embeddings provide valuable new vocabulary, reflecting cultural and technological shifts over the last decade and offering linguists rich data to analyze the evolution of English, particularly in the context of social medias rising influence. On word analogy, the new embeddings perform comparably to the 2014 embeddings, demonstrating equal structural and core semantic expressiveness. For word similarity tasks, the higher dimension 2024 embeddings occasionally overestimate the semantic similarity between antonyms. Nonetheless, the 2024 embeddings show clear advantages in temporally dependent NER datasets, such as non-Westernoriented newswire data. These findings underline the importance of updating word embeddings to keep pace with linguistic and cultural change. The 2024 embeddings represent meaningful advancement for modern language modeling, offering tools that are better aligned with contemporary usage. Their ability to capture recent cultural, technological, and linguistic shifts makes them particularly valuable for human-centered NLP applications, such as improving chatbot interactions and designing systems that adapt to diverse and evolving user needs."
