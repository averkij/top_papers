            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Recent foundation models have advanced from fluent assistants to strong problem solvers, achieving high performance on difficult, objectively graded tasks such as competition-style mathematics (e.g., AIME) and real-world software engineering (e.g., SWE-bench) [14, 22]. Meanwhile, agentsautonomous systems that navigate the internet to acquire and consolidate evidenceare increasingly used to extend models beyond parametric knowledge by coupling external search with internal reasoning and synthesizing information across multiple sources [8, 20]. Within this broader shift, deep search has emerged as foundational evaluation scenario: it stresses an agents ability to uncover hard-to-find facts or entities through multi-step exploration, denoising, and evidence-driven synthesis. Motivated by these demands, recent work has proposed stronger agentic designs [13, 1719, 28] and introduced more challenging benchmarks that better capture deep-research behavior, including BrowseComp for hard-to-find web browsing tasks and HLE for frontier, expert-level closed-ended questions [24, 32]. However, we find that current deep-research evaluation practice suffers from three major limitations. (1) 1 Figure 1 Closed-book QA measures intrinsic knowledge, while standard RAG entangles retrieval and reasoningdistractors can hide whether errors come from bad retrieval or failed evidence-based reasoning. DeR2decouples the two by evaluating the same question under controlled inputs (instruction/concepts/related/full), isolating failure causes. End-to-end pipeline confounding with weak diagnosis: many benchmarks score the full stackretrieval, reranking, summarization/compression, context stitching, and reasoningso variance is often dominated by toolchain choices rather than the models latent research reasoning capability. Moreover, most setups expose only binary correct/incorrect outcome, which makes it difficult to attribute errors to distinct failure types such as missing the key concept, identifying the concept but failing to apply it, or being diverted by topically related noise that shifts the reasoning starting point and triggers mode-switch derailment. As result, these evaluations provide limited guidance for model selection, debugging, or targeted training. (2) Parametric leakage / memorization: if tasks can be solved via memorized facts, broad encyclopedic knowledge, or easily guessable numeric forms, then correctness does not reliably indicate that the model consulted the crucial evidence and reasoned with it, contaminating the evaluation signal. (3) Web volatility and irreproducibility: benchmarks that depend on open-web retrieval inherit non-stationarity across time, region, indexing updates, and page instability (movement, deletion, or content changes), producing high variance across repeated runs and hindering controlled comparisons and ablations [32]. To address these limitations, we propose DeR2, controlled research sandbox that isolates documentgrounded reasoning while preserving the core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, noise filtering, and evidence-based conclusion making. We mitigate (1) pipeline confounding and weak diagnosis by decoupling evidence access from reasoning via four evaluation regimes: Instruction-only (parametric knowledge), Concepts (instruction + gold concept set; concept composition/scheduling without document extraction), Related-only (instruction + only relevant documents; extraction and reasoning under clear evidence), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors; denoising and reasoning). This design yields interpretable regimeto-regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss versus reasoning loss, and it supports error attribution, including missing concepts, concept misuse, and noise-induced mode switching. We mitigate (2) parametric leakage through rigorous two-phase validation protocol: each problem must exhibit parametric failure (low accuracy without documents) while remaining document-solvable (a correct solution is achievable when provided oracle concepts). This jointly enforces novelty (not answerable from memorized knowledge alone) and tractability (answerable given the intended evidence). Finally, we address (3) web volatility by replacing open-web dependence with frozen, per-instance document library (mean: 6.5 documents) drawn from 20232025 theoretical papers. Each library includes both necessary evidence and carefully selected distractors that mimic realistic, imperfect literature gathering. Each instance further provides expert-annotated concept sets and validated chain-of-thought rationales, enabling process-level evaluation of evidence usage rather than relying solely on final-answer accuracy. Our experiments reveal two consistent failure patterns. (1) Mode-switch fragility: Some models perform better under Instruction-only than under Full-set, indicating that additional documents can disrupt the controller responsible for shifting from parametric reasoning to evidence-grounded reasoning, thereby degrading performance. (2) Structural concept misuse: even when models identify and restate the correct concepts, 2 Figure 2 (a) Existing benchmarks. Closed-book QA only evaluates intrinsic (parametric) knowledge. RAG pipelines couple retrieval and reasoning end-to-end, creating reasoningretrieval tangle that masks the true cause of failure. (b) Decoupled Retrieval and Reasoning Benchmark. DeR2provides controlled setting that decouples retrieval from reasoning by comparing Instruction-only, Full DocSet (related + noise), Related-only, and Concepts-only conditions, enabling diagnosis of grounding, mode-switching, and concept execution errors. they often fail to execute them as procedures (e.g., applying rules step-by-step or instantiating abstractions), instead reverting to generic heuristics that appear plausible but produce incorrect conclusions. Our contributions are threefold: We articulate desiderata for evaluating research-oriented LLMs and show that prior QA, RAG, and reasoning benchmarks do not sufficiently isolate evidence-grounded synthesis. We release DeR2, rigorously curated benchmark featuring frozen document libraries with embedded noise, expert concept annotations, and validated CoT rationales drawn from frontier scientific literature. We provide systematic analysis of leading LLMs under this controlled setup, revealing substantial headroom even for top-tier systems and identifying concrete failure modes that future architectures and training regimes must address."

The benchmark is designed to expose failure modes that are difficult to diagnose in end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or agent-based deep research evaluations. DeR2explicitly separates (a) models ability to identify and extract solution-relevant concepts from document set, from (b) its ability to compose and schedule these concepts to derive the correct answer. This decomposition enables controlled diagnosis of where performance collapses in retrieval-infused reasoning. Compared to conventional RAG benchmarks, DeR2provides (i) controlled document set with both relevant and distractor documents, (ii) concept-level supervision that supports capability isolation, and (iii) verifiability 3 protocol ensuring that problems are not solvable by parametric memorization alone, but become solvable once the right concepts are provided."

            "content": "Each benchmark example asks the model to answer frontier scientific question by grounding its reasoning in provided set of documents. The target capability is not merely recalling definitions, but performing multi-step derivations that require selecting, instantiating, and coordinating multiple concepts. Each example is defined by tuple: Instruction: high-level academic question derived from cutting-edge scientific papers. The question should be solvable only if the model is provided with the correct concepts, making it impossible to answer without the relevant knowledge. Concepts: All the concepts, theorems, or formulas necessary to solve the instruction. These should not be overly specific experimental data, but rather generalizable scientific knowledge. CoT (Chain of Thought): The reasoning process that connects the concepts to the final answer, illustrating how the model should use the provided knowledge step by step. Answer: The answer to the instruction, which could be product, scalar value, or conclusion derived from the concepts and reasoning. Doc Set: collection of documents that provide the necessary concepts and theories to answer the question. These documents include noise documents that are unrelated to the task, ensuring balanced challenge for the model. DeR2emphasizes research-style reasoning, where the model must transform theoretical knowledge from documents into actionable steps for solving complex scientific problems. The task focuses on concept operationalization (e.g., theorem instantiation, algorithm execution) rather than simply summarizing surfacelevel content."

            "content": "We recruited annotators and reviewers from highly selective pool: all contributors are current PhD students enrolled at top-tier Chinese universities (Project 985). To reduce domain-mismatch errors, both annotators and reviewers were strictly restricted to working only within their own specialized academic fields. To attract top-tier annotators, competitive compensation package was offered, with each task rewarded at rate of 2500 RMB per annotated question. Reviewers were compensated at 350 RMB per audited item. total of 81 annotators across various scientific disciplines participated in the data collection process. Step 1: Source paper acquisition and screening. Each annotation begins with collecting source paper published in 2023 between 2025. We place special emphasis on provenance: when paper has an arXiv preprint, we use the arXiv URL date as the publication timestamp for eligibility. We exclude applied papersincluding but not limited to physics/chemistry experiments, social surveys, and numerical simulationsbecause their conclusions are often primarily experimental and do not yield instructions solvable via concept-driven logical derivation. Eligible source papers must be theory-oriented, spanning (i) theoretical foundational disciplines, (ii) theoretical engineering disciplines, and (iii) theory-driven interdisciplinary fields. As we know, the general workflow of annotators involves selecting source papers by tracking leading research groups in each domain and referencing materials published by prominent professors in the field. Step 2: Constructing the quadruple(Instruction, Answer, Concepts, CoT). After an annotator identifies an eligible source paper via abstract-level screening, they read the full paper to understand the problem setting, assumptions, and core argument. They then construct: (i) an Instruction aligned with the papers primary research question, with scope that is neither overly broad (admitting multiple valid answers) nor overly narrow (only true within the specific paper instance); (ii) complete Answer that directly resolves the Instruction, prioritizing short artifact, scalar, or concise conclusion. If the Answer is necessarily long, the annotator must provide rigorous checklist of key scoring items to make verification objective; (iii) set of 4 Figure 3 Pipeline for constructing DeR2data: PhD annotators gather theoretical papers from academic platforms, extracting instructions, concepts, CoT, and concise answers. These questions are designed to be challenging and represent cutting-edge academic problems. During the difficulty control phase, offline AI models must fail to answer correctly three times without concepts, but have chance to answer correctly when provided with the relevant concepts. When the difficulty control conditions are satisfied, retrieve the related documents and noise documents from the references of the source paper. Finally, the reviewer conducts logical quality inspection and format quality inspection on the submitted data, and verifies the difficulty control conditions again. Concepts capturing all and only the necessary theoretical concepts/theorems/formalisms required to solve the Instruction (not incidental experimental measurements); (iv) step-by-step CoT (reasoning trace) from Instruction to Answer, derived from the papers theoretical argumentation, ensuring that every knowledge item used in the CoT is included in the Concepts list. Annotators may use AI tools for brainstorming or summarization, but the Instruction and Answer must be finalized by the annotator after fully understanding the paper. We explicitly observed two recurring AI failure modes: (a) selecting peripheral intermediate quantities as the Answer, yielding an Instruction that only holds inside the specific paper context; (b) generating overly open-ended Instructions where the provided Answer becomes only one of many plausible solutions. Therefore, human authorship is required for the final InstructionAnswer pair. Step 3: Difficulty calibration under offline LLM testing. To ensure that each item is sufficiently frontier and non-trivial, we perform controlled difficulty checks using offline models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-0528 or the Doubao web client with networking disabled). We run each condition three times and record correctness: Instruction-only the model answers the Instruction without Concepts. All three attempts must be incorrect. Concepts-only the model answers with Concepts provided. Across three attempts, it must be correct at least once and incorrect at least once. If the model is correct in all three Instruction+Concepts trials, we apply one of two remedies. Option adds deep validation step by replacing Concepts with document set (Related + Noise) and retesting; if the model remains always-correct, the item is discarded, whereas if it fails at least twice, the item can be retained (this option is discouraged when the doc set exceeds three PDFs due to context limitations in common LLM interfaces). At this point, option can still be adopted, whereby annotators can iteratively 5 Figure 4 Distribution of problem domains and answer types, showing the disciplinary coverage of the benchmark and the structural diversity of target answers. edit the Instruction and/or Concepts (by adding/removing concepts or narrowing the question scope) to increase the difficulty until the calibration criteria are satisfied. Step 4: Document set construction . Once the quadruple passes difficulty calibration, the annotator constructs the document set. Starting from the source papers references, the annotator locates at least one Related document for each Concept (a single related document may cover multiple Concepts). The annotator then curates several Noise documents that are topically adjacent to the Instruction but do not contribute solutionrelevant concepts. For all documents, the annotator must verify: (i) Related documents contain the needed Concepts; (ii) Noise documents do not contain any solution Concepts while remaining on-topic; and (iii) no document contains the Answer verbatim or in an equivalent directly-recoverable form. Review and quality assurance (QA). Reviewers are selected from annotators with at least three accepted annotations. Each reviewed item is checked for both format compliance and scientific validity: (i) the Instruction is frontier academic question grounded in 20232025 theory-oriented source paper, self-contained, and appropriately scoped; (ii) the Answer is unique, unambiguous, and easy to verify (or accompanied by strict checklist when long); (iii) the Concepts are necessary knowledge items for solving the Instruction, contain no irrelevant content, and are theoretical constructs rather than paper-specific experimental values; (iv) the CoT is coherent concept-grounded derivation that uses all Concepts (no omissions), does not rely on experimental measurements as premises, and yields unique conclusion consistent with the Answer; and (v) the difficulty calibration tests are re-run by the reviewer and the document set is re-audited to confirm that no document leaks the Answer. Collaboration loop. Annotators and reviewers collaborated in shared online document workspace with high-frequency feedback. This iterative workflow enabled the rapid correction of ambiguity, scope issues, concept leakage, and document contamination, thereby improving consistency and ensuring that all accepted items met the benchmarks structural and scientific requirements."

The key idea is to provide the model with progressively more information ranging from none to oracle concepts, to clean evidence, and finally to evidence mixed with distractors so that performance gaps can be attributed to specific failure sources rather than being conflated in an end-to-end score. We consider the following four settings, each evaluated independently (see 1). These settings enable fine-grained diagnosis of three recurring failure sources: (i) Knowledge loss (Conceptsonly Instruction-only gap), (ii) Retrieval loss (Related-only Concepts-only gap), and (iii) Noise-induced loss (Full-set Related-only gap). To ensure the decoupling is meaningful, we keep the input format and evaluation procedure identical across settings; only the provided information differs."

            "title": "3.2 Models and Evaluation Protocol",
            "content": "We evaluate diverse set of state-of-the-art models. Concretely, our evaluated pool includes GPT-5.1 [21], Gemini-3-Pro [11] and Gemini-2.5-Pro [6], Claude-Opus-4.1 [2] and Claude-Sonnet-4.5 [3], DeepSeek-V3.1 and DeepSeek-V3.2 [7], Doubao-1.6 and Doubao-1.8 [4], Qwen-3-max [33], Moonshot-Kimi-k2-thinking [30], and GLM-4.6 [1]. We aim to evaluate the retrieval-enhanced reasoning capabilities of different models in controlled sandbox environment, rather than optimizing for any specific vendor stack. Controlled evaluation interface. All models are evaluated under the same protocol: each model receives fixed input instance and produces single prediction, with no web access. All retrieval signals must originate solely from the provided document set (Related-only / Full-set) or the oracle concept list (Concepts). This design enforces the intended capability decoupling between (i) knowledge selection and de-noising, (ii) document-to-concept extraction, and (iii) concept-level composition and scheduling. Because some models cannot reliably ingest the full document set (e.g., due to context-length limits that can lead to runtime errors or empty generations), we apply lightweight pre-processing utility to ensure fair evaluation across models. Specifically, we use deterministic long-text truncation rule that takes an input string content and maximum character budget max_chars (default: 30000). If max_chars is None, negative, or the input length is below the limit, the utility returns content unchanged. Otherwise, it sets half = max_chars // 2, keeps the first half characters and the last half characters, and inserts fixed marker line in between: [... Observation truncated due to length ...]. Newlines are added on both sides of the marker. To reduce evaluation overhead while keeping decoding conditions consistent across models, we use single shared sampling configuration: temperature = 1 and nucleus sampling with = 0.7 (no additional decoding constraints beyond the API defaults). Each model-setting pair is run twice, and we report the average score over the two runs. To minimize prompt-induced artifacts, we never instruct the model to quote documents verbatim; instead, we ask for concise, verifiable final answers consistent with the benchmarks answer format. All raw generations are logged verbatim. Answers are evaluated by doubao-seed-1-6-251015, using fixed evaluation prompt provided in Appendix A.

Additionally, we use simple retrieval loss, defined as the difference between the Concepts-only score and the Full-set score: Retrieval Loss (RLoss) = ScoreConcepts-only ScoreFull-set. larger retrieval loss indicates greater degradation due to retrieval."

            "title": "3.3 Results and Analysis",
            "content": "We present results in three layers: (i) overall accuracy across the four evaluation settings, (ii) controlled factor analyses that stress specific retrievalreasoning bottlenecks, and (iii) qualitative CoT-based error attribution. Overall performance and setting-wise gaps. Table 2 reports answer-level accuracy for each model under Instruction-only , Concepts-only , Related-only , and Full-set . Across models, we observe consistent ordering Concepts-only (avg. 75.39) > Related-only (avg. 62.89) > Full-set (avg. 51.25), indicating that (i) providing gold concepts substantially improves outcomes by removing concept-extraction errors, (ii) concept extraction from documents remains major source of loss, and (iii) adding distractor documents further degrades performance through evidence selection failures. Notably, we also observe counter-intuitive but recurrent phenomenon where Instruction-only (avg. 55.89) can match or even exceed Full-set (avg. 51.21) for most models, suggesting that the performance drop is not merely attributable to noise volume but to shift in the models reasoning regime once external context is introduced. Decomposing loss: retrieval vs. reasoning. The controlled settings allow us to attribute end-to-end degradation to two interpretable gaps: document-to-concept loss (the performance drop from Concepts-only to Relatedonly ) and noise-induced loss (the drop from Related-only to Full-set ). The first gap captures failures to recover and use the required concepts from evidenceincluding locating the right passages, extracting the relevant conceptual content, and operationalizing it as executable reasoning steps. The second gap isolates robustness to distractors: given that the necessary evidence is present, it measures whether the model can ignore topic-adjacent noise and sustain correct, evidence-conditioned reasoning trajectory. Overall, this decomposition matches the benchmarks intended separation of (i) evidence selection / de-noising, (ii) structured concept extraction from long-context documents, and (iii) concept-level coordination and scheduling in multi-step reasoning. Controlled factor analysis. We next stratify instances by dataset factors that are designed to surface distinct failure modes. Noise documents. As the number of noise documents increases, Full-set performance exhibits gradual but non-linear decline, consistent with the hypothesis that distractors do not simply dilute signal, but can redirect early-step abstraction and cause irreversible trajectory drift, as illustrated in Fig.6. We additionally compare cases where models retrieve relevant concepts but fail to use them: frequent pattern is that the model cites superficially relevant evidence while executing generic template solution, indicating evidence is present but not integrated into the causal chain of inference. Required concept count. Accuracy decreases as the number of required concepts grows, even under the Concepts-only setting. This shows that providing all necessary concepts does not eliminate errors: models still struggle with concept-level working memory, dependency tracking, and coordinating multiple constraints. The effect is amplified in Concepts-only and Full-set , where concept extraction errors and spurious concept injection further enlarge the hypothesis space and increase coordination burden. Reasoning depth and answer type. We bucket problems by reasoning depth (e.g., number of steps in the reference CoT) and by answer type (e.g., formula derivation, numeric, boolean, or conclusion-style). Deeper reasoning typically yields larger gaps between Concepts-only and document-based settings, reflecting compounding failures in multi-step grounding and intermediate-state maintenance. In parallel, formuladerivation items benefit the most from explicit concepts, suggesting that document-based settings often fail at 8 Figure 5 Structural and contextual complexity of the dataset. (a) Reports the distributions of reasoning step counts and required concept counts per problem, reflecting multi-step and multi-concept reasoning demands. (b) Presents the distributions of related documents, noise documents, and total documents per instance, characterizing the degree of retrieval difficulty and noise exposure in the document sets. Together, these statistics illustrate the controlled diversity of DeR2 across reasoning depth, conceptual load, and retrieval conditions. operationalizing constructive or procedural concepts (e.g., algorithm instantiation, theorem application) even when high-level definitions are recognized. Chain-of-thought and error attribution. To move beyond accuracy, we analyze predicted CoTs against reference concepts and reasoning structure. We categorize failures into three dominant modes: (1) Reasoning mode switching failure. When external documents are provided, models often abandon viable parametric reasoning path but fail to reliably anchor new evidence-driven chain. This produces the paradoxical Instruction-only Full-set behavior on non-trivial subset (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro-Preview scores 64.2 under Instruction-only , but only 53.7 when provided with more knowledge in the Full-set ; Claude-Opus-4.1-thinking scores 49.3 under Instruction-only , but only 40 in the Full-set ; similar patterns are observed for models like OpenAI-GPT-5.1-high, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp-Thinking, etc.) and indicates that switch control between internal-knowledge reasoning and context-grounded reasoning is itself bottleneck. (2) Structural retrieval errors. Errors frequently arise not from missing definitions but from failing to execute constructive mechanisms described in documents (e.g., algorithmic steps, instantiation details, auxiliaryvariable constructions). Models replace these mechanisms with familiar heuristics, yielding CoTs that are locally coherent but globally incorrect. (3) Concept coordination breakdown. Even with correct concepts available (in Concepts), models sometimes fail due to poor coordination: They activate only subset of necessary constraints, apply concepts out of order, or lose track of intermediate invariants. This highlights that retrieval-infused reasoning is not simple retrieval + reasoning composition; it requires explicit scheduling and multi-constraint control. Table 3 presents detailed breakdown of the main failure modes at the reasoning chain level, covering four controlled evaluation settings. Each sub-table within the main table includes two key types of information: first, the concept-level performance metrics (precision, recall, and accuracy) calculated via model-assisted annotation protocol; second, the distribution of error types extracted from the predicted reasoning trajectories of evaluated models. For the concept-level metrics, the calculation process follows strict workflow: we first use the model doubao-seed-1.6-251015 to extract the set of concepts explicitly applied by each evaluated model from its predicted chain-of-thought (pred_cot).

Precision and recall are computed using standard formulas based on these counts, while concept accuracy is derived by aggregating the per-instance performance results across the entire dataset. For the error type distribution, the data is collected through targeted sampling and analysis process: for each evaluated model and each of the four evaluation settings, we uniformly sample 50 instances where the models final answer is incorrect (to focus on failure modes beyond simple concept omission). We then use doubao-seed-1.6-251015 as structured evaluator, providing it with four inputs for each sampled instancethe predicted concepts (pred_concept), predicted chain-of-thought (pred_cot), ground-truth concepts (true_concept), and reference reasoning (true_cot)and prompt it to diagnose the root causes of failure. Each incorrect instance is labeled with one or more of four predefined error categories: (1) reasoningprocess error (flaws in the logical flow of reasoning), (2) numeric or formalization error (mistakes in calculations or symbolic representation), (3) missing core concept (failure to include key concept required for the correct answer), and (4) incorrect understanding or misuse of core concept (misinterpreting concept or applying it in an inappropriate context). The full prompt used to guide the doubao-seed-1.6-251015 evaluator during the error diagnosis process is provided in the appendix.A for reproducibility. In Instruction-only , the errors mainly manifest as missing core concepts and issues with general reasoning heuristics, reflecting the limitations of pure parametric knowledge. By Concepts-only , overall accuracy significantly improves, and errors related to concepts are largely eliminated; the remaining failures are predominantly procedural, indicating that simply retrieving the correct concepts does not guarantee the correct execution of multi-step reasoning. It is further observed that in the Full-set , Related-only , and Instruction-only settings, the missing core concept(MC) is the most frequent error. This aligns with the knowledge input scaling relationship, but it is worth noting that the gap in the number of missing core concepts between Instruction-only and the knowledge-providing settings (Full-set and Related-only ) is not large, with all hovering around 40, reflecting limitation in the models ability to retrieve the correct knowledge points, or the model sometimes does not even know which concepts to extract to answer the current question. Additionally, Gemini-3-Pro only made 29 errors in the Related-only setting and delivered its optimal performance in Instruction-only (with merely 34 mistakes). This indicates that Gemini may possess more endogenous knowledge, enabling it to retrieve and comprehend concepts effectively even with limited background information. 10 Figure 6 Impact of Document Characteristics on Model Performance. (a) Under the Full-set setting, model score as function of the number of noise documents. (b) Under the Full-set setting, model score as function of the number of concepts. In Concepts-only , the model must recover concepts from less relevant evidence, and both concept omission and reasoning errors reappear, revealing structural retrieval failure rather than simple definition gaps. Finally, in the Full-set setting, although some retrievals are successful, the presence of topic-related noise exacerbates reasoning errors and misalignment of concepts. Overall, these tables indicate that the performance degradation under retrieval-augmented settings is not only due to missing concepts but also stems from failures in procedural and conceptual coordination during evidence-conditioned reasoning. Additionally, in the concepts-only setting, the models precision and recall both fail to reach 1, indicating that the model cannot comprehend the provided unseen concepts, even when usage instructions for those concepts are supplied."

            "content": "Early reading comprehension benchmarks such as SQuAD [25] and Natural Questions [16] established evaluation protocols for extractive question answering over short passages. Multi-hop extensions such as HotpotQA [34] increased reasoning complexity by requiring evidence aggregation across passages, though answers remained primarily extractive. While recent variants incorporate more abstractive generation, evaluation metrics, and task designs still tend to favor localized extraction over genuine multi-document synthesis [15]. Retrieval-augmented generation benchmarks, including KILT [23], and FreshQA [31], evaluate end-to-end RAG pipelines over large corpora. By coupling retrieval with generation, they measure system-level performance, but this coupling conflates multiple capabilities, making error attribution difficult: failures may stem from retrieval gaps, reasoning deficits, or evidence integration issues. Moreover, many tasks emphasize factoid lookup or temporal fact verification rather than multi-step synthesis that requires integrating novel concepts across multiple documents. In parallel, mathematical and formal reasoning benchmarks evaluate deductive capabilities largely in isolation from document comprehension. Benchmarks like GSM8K [5], MATH [12], Omni-MATH [10] and PutnamAXIOM [9] and test multi-step problem solving with increasing complexity. Graduate-level benchmarks such as GPQA [26] and broad suites like BIG-Bench [27] increase difficulty but remain predominantly parametric: models rely on training-time knowledge rather than synthesizing information from provided evidence. Finally, long-context evaluations (e.g., recent long-context model work [29]) demonstrate improved capacity for processing extensive documents, yet they still lack systematic measurement of synthesis when evidence must be extracted from noisy, realistic corpora.

            "content": "Our benchmark is designed as controlled environment that disentangles retrieval from reasoning for documentgrounded scientific synthesis. Concretely, each instance is organized around five-field structure (Instruction, Concepts, CoT, Answer, Document Set) and two-stage verifiability protocol: problems are unsolvable in instruction-only mode, yet become solvable once the correct concepts are provided. This explicitly targets scientific reasoning that requires integrating novel concepts rather than relying on parametric recall. Unlike end-to-end RAG benchmarks that conflate retrieval and generation, we introduce evaluation settings that decouple capabilities by construction: Instruction-only isolates parametric knowledge; Concepts isolates concept-level reasoning; Related-only measures weak concept retrieval plus reasoning; and Full-set stress-tests evidence selection and de-noising under distractors. This structure enables attribution of performance loss to (i) evidence selection and de-noising, (ii) document-to-concept extraction, and (iii) concept-level composition and scheduling. Finally, by explicitly including topically adjacent but concept-irrelevant distractors in the document set, our benchmark operationalizes adversarial noise as first-class variable. This targets failure modes that are 12 typically masked in prior benchmarksespecially the difficulty of switching from parametric reasoning to evidence-grounded reasoning, and the brittleness of multi-concept coordination under evidence overload."

            "title": "5 Conclusion",
            "content": "We introduce DeR2, controlled benchmark for decoupling retrieval from reasoning in retrieval-infused problem solving. Each instance is built with two-stage verifiability protocol and structured doc set (related + distractors), enabling stable attribution of performance loss to (i) evidence selection/de-noising, (ii) document-to-concept extraction, and (iii) concept-level composition and scheduling. Across strong commercial and open models, we observe consistent non-trivial failure modes: (1) reasoning mode switching failures where Instruction-only can outperform Full-set, indicating that adding documents may disrupt previously viable parametric reasoning path; (2) structural (procedural) retrieval failures where models recognize definitions but cannot execute constructive mechanisms; (3) Concepts-only is not an upper bound, revealing bottlenecks in multi-concept coordination and long-range dependency tracking; and (4) nonlinear noise effects that alter early reasoning topology and lead to irrecoverable trajectory drift. These results suggest that deep research capability is not simple extension of end-to-end RAG accuracy: robust systems must explicitly support evidence-grounded mode control, executable concept utilization, and adaptive hypothesis management under noisy contexts. We release DeR2 to facilitate principled model selection and diagnosis for retrieval-infused reasoning and to provide practical target for future training and evaluation."

            "content": "B.1 bad case of Claude-Opus-4.1 in Instruction-only Instruction Determine the time complexity for the proposed algorithm to provably learn multi-head attention layer from random labeled examples drawn uniformly from {1}kd. The learning process must operate under the assumption that the ground truth attention and projection matrices {Θi, Wi}m satisfy i=1 set of non-degeneracy conditions, and it should output estimates { ˆWi, ˆΘi}m that result in multi-head i=1 attention layer ˆF achieving mean squared error of at most (kd)Ω(m) with specified success probability of at least 1 δ. Pred CoT Reasoning: To determine the time complexity for learning multi-head attention layer, need to analyze several key components: 1. Problem Structure: Were learning attention heads, each with matrices Θi and Wi. The input space is {1}kd, giving us (2)kd possible inputs. 2. Target Accuracy: The required MSE of (kd)Ω(m) is exponentially small in m. This extremely high accuracy requirement significantly impacts the complexity. 3. Sample Complexity Analysis: - To achieve MSE of ϵ = (kd)Ω(m), standard learning theory suggests we need O(1/ϵ2) samples for concentration - This translates to (kd)Ω(m) samples - The success probability requirement 1 δ adds log(1/δ) factor 4. Computational Cost per Sample: - For each sample, computing multi-head attention involves: - Attention score computation: O(k2d) per head - Applying attention weights: O(k2d) per head - Total per sample: O(mk2d) for all heads 5. Learning Algorithm Complexity: - Provable learning algorithms for neural networks often use momentbased or tensor decomposition methods - For multi-head structures with heads, these methods typically require computing O(m)-th order statistics - The computational cost scales exponentially with the order of moments/tensors needed 6. Total Time Complexity: - Number of samples: (kd)Ω(m) - Cost per sample processing: O(mk2d) - Success probability factor: log(1/δ) - Combined: (kd)O(m) log(1/δ) The dominant term is (kd)O(m), which arises from both the sample complexity needed for the exponentially small error and the computational requirements of provable learning methods for multi-head structures. Final answer: (kd)O(m) log(1/δ) JY (cid:3) (cid:80) True Concepts Concept 1: crude, noisy estimate for the sum of projection matrices, (cid:80) Wi, can be obtained by calculating the empirical correlation between the input sequence and the output label via the approximation (cid:2) 1 Wi, where is the all-ones matrix. Concept 2: convex body that approximates the affine hull of the attention matrices can be constructed by using linear regression to identify input examples that induce similar attention patterns across all heads and leveraging these examples to form affine linear constraints that are simultaneously satisfied by all attention matrices Θ1, . . . , Θm. Concept 3: The estimate of the projection matrix sum can be significantly refined by using the minimum-norm point within the sculpted convex body as proxy for the average attention matrix. This allows for the identification of examples that induce large-margin (approximately 1-sparse) attention patterns across all heads, which in turn provides highly accurate linear constraints on the sum of projection matrices. 24 Concept 4: The convex body sculpting process can be re-run using the refined estimate of the projection matrix sum to produce new, much more accurate convex body that is significantly closer to the true affine hull of the attention matrices. Concept 5: An epsilon-net containing candidate attention matrices is constructed not over the full space, but specifically within the estimated m-dimensional linear span of the true attention matrices {Θi}m . This i=1 crucial dimensionality reduction step reduces the search space for the subsequent brute-force step from being exponential in d2 to being exponential only in m. Concept 6: brute-force search is performed over all m-tuples of candidate matrices from the low-dimensional epsilon-net, with linear regression solved for each. The final selection of the best model is confirmed on held-out validation set, and standard generalization bounds are used to certify that this selection is correct with probability at least 1 δ. This validation step introduces logarithmic dependency on 1/δ to the overall runtime."

B.2 Bad Case of DeepSeek-V3.1 in Concepts-only Instruction Using the lifted formulation for certifiable Schubert calculus in type A, determine the total number of bilinear equations in the system SA(u, v, ww) required to test for non-vanishing Schubert coefficients for the specific case in S4 with permutations = 2143, = 3124, and = 4132. In this context, Schubert coefficients are the structure constants in the ring of Schubert polynomials, and the lifted formulation is method to create system of polynomial equations whose solutions correspond to the geometric problem of intersecting Schubert varieties. Pred CoT Reasoning: - The lifted formulation for certifiable Schubert calculus in type involves creating system of bilinear equations SA(u, v, ww) whose solutions correspond to the intersection of Schubert varieties. - The total number of bilinear equations in the system is determined by the sum of the number of descents for each permutation involved: u, v, and ww. - For permutation, the descent set Des(w) consists of indices where w(i)u003ew(i + 1). - Compute descent sets: - For = 2143: Des(u) = {1, 3}, so Des(u) = 2. - For = 3124: Des(v) = {1}, so Des(v) = 1. - For ww, first compute for S4: = 4321. Then ww = w(w(i)), with = 4132, so ww = 1423. Des(ww) = {2}, so Des(ww) = 1. - Total number of bilinear equations = Des(u) + Des(v) + Des(ww) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Concept 2: number of points in the intersection of three generically translated Schubert varieties, expressed as cw #{Xu(E) Xv(F) Xww(G)}. Concept 3: Schubert Variety Xw is the Zariski closure of Schubert cell Ωw. The problem of finding the Schubert coefficient is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to system of equations that define membership in an intersection of these varieties. counts the u,v = Concept 4: Stiefel Coordinates are set of variables used to parameterize the flags within Schubert cell ΩA These variables form the entries of matrix χA which is central to constructing the polynomial system. . Concept 5: The Lifted Formulation is method that characterizes membership in Schubert cell using system of bilinear equations by introducing auxiliary variables (e.g., α, β), avoiding the use of higher-degree determinantal equations. Concept 6: The Maximal Descent, denoted by := max(Des(u) Des(v) Des(w)), determines the number of column vectors to consider from the Stiefel coordinate matrix and sets the range of indices for the equations in the system. Theorem 1: \"The Characterization of Schubert Cell Membership states that flag Φ is in the Schubert cell w(E) if and only if for each [d], there exist unique coefficients such that specific linear combination of ΩA the flags basis vectors lies within specific subspace defined by the permutation w, i.e., gk Ewk1 Ewk .

Reasoning state Logical break (premise error).

B.3 Bad Case of Gemini-3-Pro in Full-set Instruction For the bumblebee theory, if there exists an external coupled matter field LM , and the B-field is (0, b(r), 0, 0), under the static spherically symmetric coordinate system ds2 = A(r)dt2 + S(r)dr2 + r2dΩ2, then what is the black hole solution A(r)? Pred CoT The problem asks for the black hole solution component A(r) in the context of the bumblebee theory with an external coupled matter field and radial bumblebee field Bµ = (0, b(r), 0, 0). Based on the file **Än exact Schwarzschild-like solution in bumblebee gravity model.md** (which corresponds to the work by Casana et al.), the solution is spherically symmetric vacuum solution (where the potential ensures the bumblebee field stays at its vacuum expectation value). Although the explicit derivation in Section III was truncated in the retrieved text, the metric form is revealed in Section IV.C ( Time delay of light). Equation (75) describes the null geodesic condition ds2 = 0 for the spacetime (labeled as equation 36 in the full text) as: (cid:18) 1 (cid:19) 2M dt2 + (1 + ℓ) (cid:19)1 (cid:18) 1 2M dr2 + r2dϕ2 = 0 Comparing this with the static spherically symmetric metric ds2 = A(r)dt2 + S(r)dr2 + r2dΩ2, we can identify the metric coefficients: A(r) = 1 2M , S(r) = 1 + ℓ 1 2M where ℓ = ξb2 is the Lorentz-violating parameter derived from the non-minimal coupling ξ and the vacuum expectation value b2. The temporal component A(r) remains formally identical to the Schwarzschild solution, while the radial component S(r) is modified by the parameter ℓ. Reasoning: The relevant document [file: An exact Schwarzschild-like solution in bumblebee gravity model.md] discusses spherically symmetric solution in bumblebee gravity with radial background field. The text explicitly writes the line element for null geodesics in Eq. (75) as having dt2 coefficient of (1 2M/r) and dr2 coefficient involving (1 + ℓ). This implies that the metric potential A(r), which corresponds to gtt, is 1 2M/r. This result is consistent with the known Casana et al. (2018) solution where the radial bumblebee field modifies only the grr component of the metric (and gθθ effective potentials in some contexts, but here A(r) is the focus). Final answer: A(r) = 1 2M 27 True Concepts Theorem 1: bumblebee theory: (cid:90) d4x = (cid:20) 1 2κ + ξ 2κ BµBνRµν 1 4 BµνBµν (cid:21) (cid:90) d4x LM Theorem 2: We consider the matter field to be an electromagnetic field non-minimally coupled with the bumblebee vector field. Its Lagrangian density expression reads as LM = 1 2κ (cid:0)F µνFµν + γBµBµF αβFαβ (cid:1) , Then through Maxwell equation, we can derive Ftr = (cid:112)A(r)S(r)ϕ(r). Building upon this, we solve the modified Maxwells equations to obtain, ϕ(r) = . Concept 1: For convenience, we set ℓ = ξb2 as Lorentz-violating parameter, we consider spacelike background bµ with the form bµ = (0, br(r), 0, 0). Utilizing the aforementioned condition bµbµ = b2 = const, we can derive br(r) = b(cid:112)S(r). C1 Concept 2: By simplifying Einstein equations, we obtain: [S(r)A(r)] = 0, which implies that S(r) = A(r) where C1 is constant. Similar to the Schwarzschild-like black hole solution in bumblebee gravity, we set the value of C1 to be 1 + ℓ. Solving Einstein equations {t, t}, we can get A(r). , A(r)S(r) 4A(r)S(r) A(r) 2A(r) + A(r)2 4A(r)2 + S(r) rS(r) + 2ϕ(r)2S(r) (2 + ℓ) = 0 Answer status Incorrect Incorrect derivation path due to neglecting key constraints. The model ignored the \"external Causes of errors coupled matter field LM \" setting in the prompt, erroneously simplifying the problem to vacuum solution (non-charged solution) under pure Bumblebee gravity. Missing/incorrect content Omission of electromagnetic field contribution: Did not mention the Lagrangian of the non-minimally coupled electromagnetic field or its Maxwell equation solution ϕ(r) = q/r. Omission of source terms in Einstein equations: Failed to include the energy-momentum tensor contribution from LM when solving for A(r). Missing term in the answer formula The final A(r) lacks the charge-related correction term 2(1+ℓ)q2 (2+ℓ)r2 . Concepts Recall Status Partially retrieved. Mentioned the definition of Lorentz-violating parameter ℓ, but severely omitted: The complete action form of Bumblebee theory; The matter field Lagrangian LM and its Maxwell equation solution ϕ(r) = q/r; The solution process of Einstein equations including the matter field (derivation of the correction to A(r) from ϕ(r)). Reasoning state Logical break. The break occurred in the initial phase of understanding the problem premises and selecting formulas. The problem explicitly states the existence of an \"external coupled matter field LM \", but the model erroneously claimed the solution is spherically symmetric vacuum solution, neglected the matter field, and used charge-free Schwarzschild-like solution, resulting in the metric coefficient missing the charge contribution."
