            "content": "Human behavior traits (or behavioral summaries) refer to outwardly observable patterns of conduct inferred from public information such as spoken or written language, facial expressions, and biographical records (Rothe, 2017; Johnson, 1997; DeNeve & Cooper, 1998; Briggs & Cheek, 1986). These traits differ from psychological personality, which concerns internal dispositions typically measured through self-reports or expert evaluation (Cattell et al., 1970; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975; Myers et al., 1998; Goldberg, 1993). Unlike clinical diagnoses, behavior traits can be inferred ethically and at scale from non-intrusive signals, offering reproducible, population-level insights that complement personality research without medicalizing individuals. Advances in large language models (LLMs) (Achiam et al., 2023; Floridi & Chiriatti, 2020; Jiang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024) have further expanded this feasibility. Several studies demonstrate that LLM-based assessments of behavior traits aligned with the Big Five framework can be reliable under carefully designed prompting strategies (Serapio-Garcıa et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Tseng et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2024). These approaches enable large-scale, automated analysis while mitigating some biases inherent in self-reports. Related Work. Research on human attributes spans two complementary directions: internal personality and external behavior traits. Psychologically internal personality has traditionally been measured Equal contributions."

(1) AthlePersona was constructed by collecting player rosters and publicly available data (including facial images and basic features) from the official websites of major sports leagues. These data were then processed with LLMs for inferring behavior traits. (2) CelebPersona was derived from the CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015). Celebrity face identities were linked to their corresponding Wikidata entities, enabling the retrieval of additional biographical details and physical characteristics, which were similarly processed with LLMs for inferring behavior traits. with self-report instruments such as the 16PF (Cattell et al., 1970), EPQ (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975), MBTI (Myers et al., 1998), and the Big Five framework (Goldberg, 1993). In contrast, behavior traits emphasize outwardly observable patterns, inferred from signals such as text, facial expressions, physiology, or digital traces. Several datasets target this perspective, including SALSA for group interactions (Alameda-Pineda et al., 2015), nonsocial-context datasets for daily activities (Dotti et al., 2018), driving and physiological data for trait prediction (Evin et al., 2022), and lifelog corpora capturing multimodal daily behavior (Chung et al., 2022). Digital records such as Facebook Likes have also been shown to predict sensitive traits, including personality dimensions (Kosinski et al., 2013). Other multimodal resources, such as YouTube-Vlogs (Biel & Gatica-Perez, 2012), FI-V2 (Escalante et al., 2020), MuPTA (Ryumina et al., 2023), and MDPE (Cai et al., 2024), combine video, audio, or physiological signals for prediction tasks like impression analysis or deception detection, but they typically lack explicit textual trait descriptions or frameworks for cross-modal interpretation. comparison table of different datasets is in Tab. A1. Beyond datasets, empirical studies show that observable features in one modality can signal traits in another. For instance, facial structure has been linked to health and aggression cues (Kramer & Ward, 2010; Carre & McCormick, 2008), body images to personality judgments (Naumann et al., 2009), and facial behavior to Big Five traits (Cai & Liu, 2022). Together, these works underscore the promise of behavior trait analysis, but existing resources are limited for systematic cross-modal and causal study. See App. A2 for more details. To address these gaps, we introduce PersonaX, curated collection of multimodal datasets that contain LLM-inferred behavior traits. The assessments are derived from public information, including direct quotes from interviews, observed behaviors, career trajectories, and biographical details. For consistency, we follow the Big Five framework (Goldberg, 1993), providing trait scores across its five dimensions. PersonaX includes (i) CelebPersona, comprising 9444 public figures from the CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015), and (ii) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across seven major sports leagues. Each record integrates (1) textual trait descriptions and Big Five scores inferred by three high-performing LLMs, (2) facial images, and (3) structured biographical metadata. To safeguard privacy, we release only transformed embeddings rather than raw images or text. The proposed dataset provides unique foundation for cross-modal and causal analysis. Our contributions are mainly twofold. (i) We release PersonaX, set of multimodal datasets that combine LLM-inferred behavior traits, facial embeddings, and biographical metadata for large populations of public figures. (ii) We introduce two-level analysis framework: at the structured level, applying diverse independence tests to uncover behavior-trait dependencies; and at the unstructured level, proposing causal representation learning approach with identifiability guarantees tailored to multimodal, multi-measurement settings.

Together, they provide large-scale resources for studying LLM-inferred behavior traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes. We first describe the construction of each dataset below, then detail the selection of LLMs and prompts for trait generation in 2.1, and finally discuss consent, privacy, and bias considerations in 2.2. AthlePersona. Built from scratch, this dataset documents 4181 male professional athletes across seven major sports leagues worldwide, including the NBA, NFL, NHL, ATP, PGA, Premier League, and Bundesliga1. From official league sources, we collected biographical information (e.g., name, birth date, nationality), physical attributes (e.g., height, weight), and facial images. Nationalities were geocoded into continuous spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) to support geographic analyses. CelebPersona. This dataset builds on the established CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015), which contains rich facial attribute annotations. We linked each celebritys name to its corresponding WikiData entity, enabling retrieval of additional biographical details and physical characteristics. From the original 40 CelebA attributes, we manually retained 10 (e.g., Big Nose, High Cheekbones) that reflect more stable, inherent appearance properties, while discarding attributes subject to shortterm variation (e.g., Heavy Makeup). CelebPersona totally contains 9444 public figures. Multimodality. Each record integrates three components: (1) textual behavior-trait descriptions and Big Five scores inferred by LLMs, (2) facial images or embeddings with attribute annotations, and (3) structured biographical metadata. The full feature lists of AthlePersona and CelebPersona are shown in Tab.A2 and Tab.A3, respectively. Dataset distributions for each feature are presented in Fig.A1 and Fig. A2.

GPT-4.5-Preview (Achiam et al., 2023) was excluded due to high API costs, and Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-02-05 (Team et al., 2023) was merged into the later Gemini-2.5-Pro release.

We experimented with numeric vs. textual outputs (e.g., {1,2,3} vs. {disagree, neutral, agree}), 3-level vs. 5-level scoring scales (e.g., {1,2,3} vs. {1,2,3,4,5}), and different ordering directions (e.g., {1,2,3} vs. {3,2,1}), running controlled trials across all candidate models. Results showed that 3-level scales with numeric outputs minimized variability, whereas 5-level scales increased inconsistency. detailed comparison of scoring scales and complete prompts is provided in Prompt 3.

For each individual, trait scores are derived by prompting three LLMs to generate text descriptions, which are then mapped to Big Five trait scores. To ensure robustness, we remove 0 scores (denoting insufficient information) and aggregate the remaining values using median-based voting rule that minimizes sensitivity to outliers. For CelebPersona, facial attributes across multiple images are also aggregated into single stable value per person through majority voting. More implementation details on the voting and aggregation procedures for trait scores and facial attributes are provided in App. A5.1. To examine dependencies between trait scores and other structured features, we apply five different independence test methods: three non-parametric approaches (KCI (Zhang et al., 2012), RCIT (Strobl et al., 2019), HSIC (Gretton et al., 2005)) and two tests designed for discrete variables (Chi-square (Tallarida et al., 1987) and G-square (Tsamardinos et al., 2006)). The detailed descriptions about these methods are summarized in Tab. A6. dependency is deemed significant if < 0.05. Fig.3 shows how many of the five methods found significant dependence, and plots the score distributions. Complete p-value results for each independent test method are reported in Tab. A3 and Tab. A4. The heatmaps in Fig.3 reveal clear and interpretable dependency patterns across celebrities and athletes. In CelebPersona, demographic attributes such as gender and occupation exhibit strong dependence with nearly all trait scores, whereas in AthlePersona, stronger dependencies arise with birth year and league affiliation. Physical attributes display divergent effects: celebrities show significant associations between facial features (e.g., pointy nose, arched eyebrows) and trait scores, while athletes exhibit more consistent yet moderate associations with height and weight.

            "content": "Instead of using well-built tabular data, here we aim to directly learn the latent variables and their underlying causal mechanisms from unstructured data, such as text and images. This task has been widely studied as causal representation learning (CRL) (Xu et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Daunhawer et al., 2023; Sturma et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2025). Our persona datasets inherently contain both multi-measurement and multi-modal information 3, capturing rich observations across diverse formats. Inspired by that, we therefore design corresponding multi-modality multi-measurement CRL method. Fig.4 shows the causal model of our unique problem setting. Our framework unifies and extends prior work (Yao et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2025), supported by new identifiability theory specifically tailored to the multi-modality, multi-measurement setting. The overall structure of this section is as follows: we first formulate the causal model in 4.1, then establish the identifiability theory results in 4.2, followed by details on network training in 4.3, synthetic experiments in 4.4, and real-world analysis on the curated PersonaX dataset in 4.5. Figure 4: Multi-modality multi-measurement causal model. Latent space is in grey. is shared latent variables across different modalities, is modality-specific latent variables. xm,i denotes the m-th modality i-th observed measurement. ϵ is the independent noise term. 4.1 CAUSAL MODEL FORMULATION Data-generating processes. Let := [x1, . . . , xM ] be set of observations/measurements from modalities, where xm Rdm represents the observation from modality with dimensionality dm. Let = [z1, . . . , zM ] be the set of causally related latent variables underlying m-th modalities. Specifically, the data generation process (see Fig. 4) can be formulated as zm,i := gzm,i (Pa(zm,i), s, ϵm,i), xm := gxm (zm, ηm), (latent causal relations) (generating functions) (1) (2) where we denote the parents of variable with Pa(). Since we allow for general causal relations within each modality and across multiple modalities, Pa() potentially returns latent variables across multiple modalities. Additionally, we allow the shared latent variable generally governing the modality-specific latent variables zm. The differentiable function gz encodes the latent causal graph connecting latent components and its Jacobian matrix Jgz can be permuted into strictly triangular matrix. We use ϵm,i to denote the exogenous variable for zm,i and exogenous variables are mutually independent. We use ηm to denote modality-specific information independent of other components. Identifiability definition. As mentioned previously, our aim was to learn the latent variables underlying each modality and their causal relations. Formally, for two specifications θ := {gxm , gzm, p(s), p(ϵm), p(ηm)}M m=1 of the datagenerating process Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 that fit the marginal distribution p(x), we would like to show that: given the same value, each latent component ˆzm,i is equivalent to its counterpart zm,i up to an invertible map hm,i, i.e., ˆzm,i = hm,i(zm,i). This property is known as identifiability. m=1 and ˆθ := {ˆgxm , ˆgzm, ˆp(s), ˆp(ϵm), ˆp(ηm)}M 3Multi-modality (a.k.a., multi-view) refers to different types of data formats, such as facial images and textual descriptions. Multi-measurement usually denotes the different instantiations of the same modality, for example, celebrity photos captured at different locations or an individuals trait description generated by different LLMs."

We establish theoretical guarantees for the identifiability of our model under specific conditions. The proofs are in App. A6. Theorem 1.

Then we have [ˆzm, ˆs] = h(zm, s), where is an invertible and differentiable function. Discussions. Assumption is moderate condition that ensures the probability distributions are well-defined and computable. Assumption ii informally requires that distinct input distributions correspond to distinct output distributions. In similar spirit, Assumption iii guarantees that different values of zm induce different conditional distributions p(xm,B zm), e.g., heteroskedastic noise. It is important to note that this condition is significantly weaker than monotonicity conditions. Finally, Assumption iv imposes the differentiability of the mapping from [zm, s] to pxm,B zm,s, which can be explicitly enforced through the use of differentiable models, i.e., variational autoencoders (VAEs). Theorem 2. (Identifiability of Shared Subspace) Suppose assumptions are hold true for all the modality and the whole latent space, and we further assume (Entropy Regularization): ˆg1 xm (cid:80) k[M ] (cid:0)ˆg1 xk (xk)(cid:1) . represent set of shared latent variable encoders that minimizes Then we have the ˆs = hs(s), where hs is an invertible function. Discussions. After identifying the entire latent space and each latent subspace underlying modality observations: {[z1, s] . . . , [zM , s]}, the shared component can be isolated by leveraging the preliminary result that each is block-wise identifiable. This enables the application of existing techniques for isolating shared latent spaces, as developed in (Yao et al., 2023; Von Kugelgen et al., 2021)."

Let w(m) = (cid:16) 3 log p(zms) z2 m,1sds , , (cid:16) 2 log p(zms) zm,1sds , , 3 log p(zms) z2 sds m,dm 2 log p(zms) zm,dm sds (cid:17) (cid:17) (cid:16) 3 log p(zms) ct,ict,jsds (cid:17) (i,j)E(Mzm ) , (3) where denotes concatenation operation and (i, j) E(Mzm) denotes all pairwise indice such that zm,i, zm,j are adjacent in Mzm. For [1, , n], there exist 4n + Mzm different values of sds, such that the 4n + Mzm values of vector functions w(m) are linearly independent. ii (Sparsity Regularization): Let {0, 1}dzdz denote the true adjacency matrix of the latent causal graph, and ˆG {0, 1}dzdz be the estimated adjacency matrix. We assume that the estimated graph is at most as dense as the true graph: where 0 denotes the elementwise ℓ0 norm, i.e., the number of nonzero entries. Then we have ˆzm,i = hi(zm,π(j)), where hi is an invertible and differentiable function. ˆG0 G0, Discussions. The core idea is to exploit the rich multi-modal information present in behavior trait datasets to disentangle shared latent variables from modality-specific ones. Shared latent factors, e.g., genetic traits, act as confounders and induce sufficient variability across modality-specific components. This motivates the adoption of nonlinear ICA techniques (Hyvarinen et al., 2019). To achieve identifiability, we impose structural constraints derived from the ground-truth Markov network Mzm onto the estimated network Mˆzm , leveraging the established connection between conditional independence and vanishing cross-partial derivatives (Lin, 1997): if zm,izm,j {s, z{zm,i, zm,j}}, then 2 log p(zm) zm,izm,j = 0. These established conditions shed light on the design of training network. 4.3 NETWORK TRAINING Embedding extraction. For images, we adopt ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023) to obtain 1024dimensional embeddings, leveraging its strength in multimodal representation learning. For text, we use gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct (Bai et al., 2023), foundation model optimized for longsentence embeddings, yielding 3584-dimensional vectors. Importantly, the released dataset does not contain raw images or text. Instead, all images and texts are converted into embeddings and further transformed through an additional invertible transformation, ensuring privacy while preserving utility. (cid:80) Encoders and decoders. Each modality has its own encoder, which estimates modality-specific latents ˆzm, exogenous variables ˆηm, and shared latents s. To maintain conditional independence across measurements, decoders reconstruct each observation separately. This reconstruction is optimized via mean squared error: LRecon = (cid:80) Independence constraints. To enforce theoretical assumptions, we require independence among latents and exogenous variables. This is implemented by aligning their joint distribution ˆγ with an isotropic Gaussian prior using KL divergence: LInd = KL(p(γ) (0, I)). Sparsity regularization. Causal relations are captured through learnable adjacency matrix ˆA, implemented via normalizing flows (Papamakarios et al., 2021). sparsity penalty encourages minimal yet sufficient causal graphs: LSp = ˆA1.

            "title": "4.4 SYNTHETIC EXPERIMENTS ON VARIANT MNIST",
            "content": "We first evaluate our method on synthetic data derived from MNIST (LeCun, 1998), benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines including BetaVAE (Higgins et al., 2017), Multimodal Contrastive Learning (MCL; (Daunhawer et al., 2023)), and Multimodal Causal Representation Learning (MMCRL; (Sun et al., 2025)). We construct two modalities using Colored MNIST (Arjovsky et al., 2019) and Fashion MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017), where cross-modal causal dependencies are explicitly designed: the horizontal position of digits affects image transparency, which in turn causally influences the vertical placement of fashion items and consequently their grayscale intensity. Fig.5(a) illustrates some generated images, while Fig.5(b) shows the underlying causal graph. This setup provides structured yet non-deterministic mapping across modalities. Refer to App. A8 for more details. As shown in Fig. 5(c), our method achieves an R2 of 0.96 and an MCC of 0.92, clearly outperforming MMCRL which reaches R2 of 0.90 and MCC of 0.85, and also consistently surpassing both BetaVAE and MCL. These results highlight the advantage of explicitly modeling cross-modal causal dependencies with multiple measurements, setting where existing approaches remain constrained. 4.5 REAL-WORLD TRAIT ANALYSIS ON PE N AX After validating our method on synthetic data with strong results, we next apply it to the PersonaX datasets, training networks to learn latent representations and then applying causal discovery to obtain meaningful causal graph. Fig. 6 shows the causal graph obtained from AthlePersona, while results for CelebPersona are provided in App. A9. The discovered latents naturally group into three categories: shared latents (Sk), image-based latents (Z1,k), and trait-based latents (Z2,k). From AthlePersona, we identify two shared factors (S1, S2), five image-based latents (Z1,1Z1,5), and five trait-based latents (Z2,1Z2,5). Importantly, the estimated latents may correlate with, but are not necessarily identical to, the well-defined Big Five traits. After obtaining the causal graph, we assign each variable concrete interpretation, guided by the independence test results reported in Tab. A7, to facilitate clearer analysis. The undirected edge between S1 and S2 suggests bidirectional relation between mindset and culture. mindset (S1) influences self-awareness (Z2,4). Moreover, cross-modal links reveal that confidence (Z2,1) affects facial expressions (Z1,4), and emotional stability (Z2,3) impacts grooming (Z1,2). sequential pathway emerges among image-based latents: Z1,1 (skin tone) Z1,3 (attractiveness) Z1,4 (facial expressions), highlighting appearance factors in athletes. Figure 6: The causal graph with latent variables learned from AthlePersona dataset. Red, blue, and green nodes correspond to shared latents, image latents, and behavior trait latents. Together, these findings validate our framework: synthetic experiments confirm identifiability and quantitative performance, while real-world analysis demonstrates its ability to uncover meaningful and interpretable cross-modal causal structures in human trait data. See App. A9 for more analysis."

See App. A1 for more discussions. Conclusion. We presented PersonaX, two multimodal datasets linking LLM-inferred behavioral traits with facial and biographical information. Our two-level analysis pipeline combines structured dependence tests with unstructured causal representation learning, addressing both theoretical and empirical aspects: theoretically, we propose novel identifiability theory tailored for multimodal, multi-measurement CRL; empirically, we demonstrate population-specific patterns and interpretable latent structures. These resources provide foundation for studying invariant causal mechanisms of human behavioral traits while promoting diversity, equality, and mutual respect for all human beings."

            "content": "A1 ETHICS STATEMENTS AND BROADER IMPACTS Understanding human behavioral traits has broad implications for psychology, humancomputer interaction, and AI personalization. By releasing two multimodal, publicly accessible datasets (CelebPersona and AthlePersona) together with two-level causal analysis framework, this work provides the community with resource to systematically investigate behavioral traits in relation to facial and biographical features, and to advance methodological research in multimodal CRL. The ethical considerations and limitations must be acknowledged. We recognize that inferring behavioral traits from public data carries risks of reinforcing stereotypes or enabling misuse in sensitive domains (e.g., hiring, lending, surveillance). To mitigate these risks, (i) all data is sourced from consent-based, legally accessible platforms; (ii) no raw images or texts are releasedonly transformed embeddings with additional obfuscation; and (iii) we enforce strict non-commercial usage restrictions, accompanied by detailed guideline file (USAGE GUIDELINES.md). These safeguards are intended to reduce the likelihood of misuse while maintaining research utility. The current release is demographically limited: AthlePersona covers only male athletes, while CelebPersona focuses on high-visibility celebrities. These choices were intentional: male professional leagues attract broader and more consistent public attention with accessible records, and the celebrity dataset builds upon the established CelebA benchmark. In both cases, we deliberately selected cohorts with sufficient public visibility to ensure the availability of high-quality data for reliable LLM inference for behavior traits. As such, results should not be interpreted as universally representative, but rather as population-specific analyses across complementary domains (sports and entertainment). We explicitly view broader demographic coverage (e.g., female athletes, less visible public figures, longitudinal data) as crucial direction for subsequent dataset extensions. Our overarching goal is to foster understanding of population-level patterns, not deterministic inference about individuals. We actively discourage applications in high-stakes decision-making, and instead encourage the community to use PersonaX for methodological development (e.g., causal discovery under selection bias, multimodal integration) and for examining fairness and robustness across social contexts. We also plan to update the dataset iteratively in response to community feedback, with inclusivity and transparency as guiding principles. Overall, this work aims to advance the scientific study of behavioral traits while foregrounding fairness, privacy, and ethical responsibility. By articulating clear limitations, safeguards, and future commitments, we hope to enable constructive research and minimize risks of harmful deployment. A2 DETAILS ABOUT RELATED WORK A2.1 HUMAN BEHAVIOR TRAIT ANALYSIS Human behavior traits have long been central to understanding how individuals reflect on their strengths, limitations, and interpersonal tendencies (Rothe, 2017; Johnson, 1997; DeNeve & Cooper, 1998; Briggs & Cheek, 1986). In contrast to psychological personality, which emphasizes internal dispositions typically assessed through self-reports or expert evaluation, behavior traits focus on outwardly observable patterns inferred from language, facial appearance, physiological states, and digital traces. Traditional self-report instruments, such as Cattells 16PF (Cattell et al., 1970), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975), and the MyersBriggs Type Indicator (Myers et al., 1998), provided early frameworks for personality assessment. The Big Five (Goldberg, 1993) has since emerged as the prevailing paradigm, supported by strong empirical evidence and predictive power (Cobb-Clark & Schurer, 2012; Oshio et al., 2018; Komarraju et al., 2011; Roccas et al., 2002; Gerber et al., 2011). However, these methods remain vulnerable to self-report biases and limited scalability. Computational approaches have sought to infer traits from observable signals rather than introspection. Examples include linguistic cues (Pennebaker et al., 1999), handwriting (Asra & Shubhangi, 2015), speech (Mohammadi et al., 2010), facial expressions (Gucluturk et al., 2018), and online profiles (Youyou et al., 2015; Celli et al., 2014). landmark study by (Kosinski et al., 2013) showed that"

Focus distinguishes between inner personality (psychological, self-reported) and outer behavior traits (observable signals). Score indicates whether personality or trait scores are included. Text Desc. shows whether textual trait descriptions are available. Modalities lists the input data types. Task / Focus describes the primary research application. Unlike prior datasets, PersonaX uniquely combines multimodal signals with both scores and textual descriptions, supporting systematic crossmodal and causal analyses. Facebook Likes could predict wide range of sensitive traits, including personality and demographics, with accuracies comparable to psychometric tests. Beyond digital traces, physiological and behavioral signals have been linked to traits in contexts such as driving (Evin et al., 2022), smart-home daily activities (Dotti et al., 2018), and long-term lifelogging (Chung et al., 2022). These works demonstrate the potential of behavioral data for trait inference, often in settings where traditional questionnaires are impractical. Several multimodal datasets have been developed to study traits in richer contexts. SALSA (AlamedaPineda et al., 2015) captures group behavior at social events through multimodal recordings with personality annotations. YouTube-Vlogs (Biel & Gatica-Perez, 2012), FI-V2 (Escalante et al., 2020), MuPTA (Ryumina et al., 2023), MDPE (Cai et al., 2024), and Amigos (Miranda-Correa et al., 2018) integrate video, audio, and physiological data for tasks such as impression analysis or affect recognition. While valuable, these datasets are generally small-scale and lack explicit textual trait descriptions or unified frameworks for cross-modal analysis. Other resources like CelebA (Liu et al., 2015), FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019), and FairFace (Karkkainen & Joo, 2021) enable large-scale analysis of facial attributes but do not provide trait or personality annotations. Complementing dataset development, empirical studies have examined how outward features in one modality can signal traits in another. The kernel of truth hypothesis (Zebrowitz, 2018) suggests that physical cues may reflect behavioral tendencies, supported by findings linking facial morphology to health (Kramer & Ward, 2010), aggression (Carre & McCormick, 2008), and personality judgments from body images (Naumann et al., 2009). More recently, machine learning methods have shown that Big Five traits can be predicted from facial behavior (Cai & Liu, 2022; Youyou et al., 2015; Kachur et al., 2020). Beyond vision, correlations have also been observed with activity levels (Wilson & Dishman, 2015), sensor data (Dotti et al., 2018), and physiological signals (Gao et al., 2019). Despite these advances, existing resources remain fragmented: many rely on self-reports, others are constrained to controlled laboratory settings, and most lack integration of textual, visual, and biographical information in unified framework. Our contribution addresses this gap by introducing PersonaX, which provides two multimodal datasets, CelebPersona and AthlePersona, linking facial, physical, and occupational features with LLM-inferred Big Five behavior traits. This enables systematic exploration of cross-modal relationships and supports both predictive and causal analyses at scale. A2.2 CAUSAL DISCOVERY AND CAUSAL REPRESENTATION LEARNING Causal discovery (Spirtes et al., 2001) from observational data has attracted considerable attention in recent decades. Constraint-based and score-based methods are two primary categories in causal discovery. Constraint-based methods, such as PC (Spirtes & Glymour, 1991) and FCI (Spirtes et al., 1995), leverage conditional independence tests (CIT; (Zhang et al., 2012; Strobl et al., 2019; Gretton et al., 2005; Tallarida et al., 1987; Tsamardinos et al., 2006)) to estimate the graph skeleton and"

            "content": "then determine the orientation. For score-based methods, the approach can vary based on the search strategy, which may involve greedy search, exact search, or continuous optimization. One typical score-based method with greedy search is Greedy Equivalent Search (GES) (Chickering, 2002). The exact score-based methods are often time-consuming, such as dynamic programming (DP) (Koivisto & Sood, 2004), A* (Yuan et al., 2011), and integer programming (Cussens, 2011; Li & Wu, 2022). NOTEARS (Zheng et al., 2018) is the first work to cast the Bayesian network structure learning task into continuous constrained optimization problem (Li et al., 2022; 2024d) with the least squares objective. Subsequent work GOLEM (Ng et al., 2020) adopts continuous unconstrained optimization formulation with likelihood-based objective. line of works have extended NOTEARS to handle nonlinear cases via deep neural networks, such as DAG-GNN (Yu et al., 2019) and DAG-NoCurl (Yu et al., 2021). Some methods are developed to improve the computational efficiency, e.g., ψDAG (Ziu et al., 2024). In recently years, there are activa researches on causal discovery from various data constraints, including distributed data (Li et al., 2024c), heterogeneous data (Huang et al., 2020), deterministic relations (Li et al., 2024b), latent confounder and selection bias (Luo et al., 2025), and etc. Causal representation learning (CRL) aims to recover high-level causal variables from low-level observations, bridging machine learning and causal inference (Scholkopf et al., 2021; Li et al., 2025; Fan et al., 2024). It generalizes classical causal discovery (Spirtes et al., 2001) by learning structured representations that respect causal semantics. CRL methods with identifiability guarantees typically rely on additional assumptions: (1) Functional constraints on the data-generating process (Xu et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2022); (2) Interventional or multi-environment data that introduce distributional shifts to expose latent structure (Hyvarinen et al., 2019; Khemakhem et al., 2020); (3) Multimodal or multiview settings, where aligned observations across modalities help identify shared causal factors through sample-level invariance (Yao et al., 2023; Daunhawer et al., 2023; Sturma et al., 2023). Recent studies unify these approaches under general invariance principles, showing that many can be seen as special cases of broader framework (Ahuja et al., 2023). Parallel to these theoretical advances, some works focus on practical CRL applications without strict identifiability. Examples include variational methods for biomedical data (Mao et al., 2022), contrastive learning for multimodal causal analysis (Zheng et al., 2024), and causal discovery on neuroimaging datasets (Rawls et al., 2021). In contrast, our work aims to combine both theory and application: we derive formal identifiability conditions under multi-modality multi-measurement settings and integrate these insights into practical estimation framework for human trait analysis. A2.3 MULTIMODALITY AND REPRESENTATION LEARNING In the context of broader machine learning, multimodal representation learning focuses on integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio, to learn unified representations for downstream tasks (Manzoor et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2020). Among these methods, contrastive learning has emerged as powerful approach, particularly for weakly supervised settings, due to its scalability and effectiveness (Daunhawer et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2022; Radford et al., 2021; Khosla et al., 2020; Oord et al., 2018). prominent example is CLIP model (Radford et al., 2021), which aligns text and image embeddings through contrastive objectives (Sun et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2022; Girdhar et al., 2023). Unlike these methods that primarily aim for discriminative or generative performance, our work is centered on uncovering the underlying causal structure shared across modalities, with the specific goal of generating insights into personalities through principled causal representations. A2.4 LLM REASONING AND INFERENCE Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), Gemini (Team et al., 2023), DeepSeek (Liu et al., 2024), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), and Claude (Anthropic, 2023) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and inference capabilities across wide range of tasks, including arithmetic (Cobbe et al., 2021), commonsense reasoning (Srivastava et al., 2022), text editing and generation (Tang et al., 2025), code generation (Chen et al., 2021), and scientific QA (Wang et al., 2023). These models perform zero-shot or few-shot reasoning using techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022), self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023), active prompting (Diao et al., 2023), confidence-based If-or-Else prompting (Li et al., 2024a)"

Despite their black-box nature, LLMs have shown emergent abilities to perform structured reasoning without explicit supervision, making them powerful general-purpose inference engines. Recent research has explored the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer, simulate, and even express human personality traits.

Similarly, (Serapio-Garcıa et al., 2023) show that LLMs can produce consistent personality profiles when prompted, often aligning with outputs from standardized psychometric assessments. Beyond inference, other studies examine how LLMs naturally exhibit personality-like traits in their responses. (Jiang et al., 2023) introduce methods to control and elicit desired personality traits in language model outputs, while (Wang et al., 2025) analyze the emergent ability of LLMs to emulate distinct personality patterns during generation. Furthermore, recent works such as (Tiuleneva et al., 2024; Rao et al., 2023) utilize LLMs to annotate or assess personality traits from textual data, illustrating their growing role in computational personality research. Our work addresses these limitations by providing multimodal datasets that unite visual, physical, demographic, and personality dimensions, with multiple model-generated assessments that enable systematic evaluation.

For each celebrity sample, there are at least two facial images taken from different angles, and up to 35 facial images per sample, referenced via relative file paths. The AthlePersona dataset focuses on high-profile athletes and contains similar structure to CelebPersona, with emphasis on athletic context. It captures personal traits such as birth year, month, and day, physical measurements like height and weight, and the name of the athletes league. Personality descriptions and Big Five scores are again generated by ChatGPT, Gemini, and LLaMA, with final aggregated trait scores summarizing the predictions. Unlike CelebPersona, this dataset includes only single facial image per athlete but maintains key demographic and geographic metadata. It omits facial feature annotations and categorical occupation labels, instead reflecting the athletic domain through the league information. A3.2 DISTRIBUTION PLOTS The Figure A1 shows the distribution of AthlePersona. The AthlePersona dataset is dominated by athletes born between 1985 and 2005, with uniform spread across birth months and days. Most individuals are associated with NFL, NHL and NBA, showing strong skew toward U.S. sports. Heights cluster around 180199 cm, and weights around 90109 kg, which aligns with physical norms for elite athletes in contact sports. Nationalities are overwhelmingly North American, with minimal representation from other continents, highlighting clear Western and U.S.-centric dataset bias. The Figure A2 shows the distribution of CelebPersona. The CelebPersona dataset predominantly features younger individuals, with birth years peaking between 19901999, and shows balanced distribution across birth months and days. Most individuals are from North America and Europe, with underrepresentation from other continents. There is notable occupational bias toward Entertainment,"

A4 DETAILS ABOUT LLM SELECTION AND PROMPT DESIGN Throughout this paper, we rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate human personality. Fortunately, Benefiting from the recent explosion in the size and availability of LLMs (Achiam et al., 2023; Floridi & Chiriatti, 2020; Jiang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2023), some research has shown that personality measurements in the outputs of some LLMs under specific prompting configurations are valid and reliable (Serapio-Garcıa et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Tseng et al., 2024). We built our datasets from number of professional athletes and celebrities, based on the facts that they are famous and it is likely to have sufficient information about them online. In Section 2.1, we present some experiments to show how to select LLMs for personality generation, and also how to design the prompts. In the following, we will demonstrate more details. A4.1 DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO SELECT LLMS (REGARDING TABLE 1) Model Choices in Table 1. We present the comparative evaluations on 10 of the state-of-the-art LLMs on our two persona datasets. Initially, we choose the Top 10 models based on the Arena leaderboard (Chiang et al., 2024). To enhance diversity, we also included Qwen2.5-Max and QwQ32B (Bai et al., 2023) from Alibaba, both noted for their strong reasoning capabilities. We list all those 12 LLMs and summarize them in Table A5, including the model name, the company name,"

Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-02-05 (Team et al., 2023) was omitted due to inaccessibility, it was merged to the latest Gemini-2.5-Pro-Exp-03-25 model. Therefore, in the end, we only considered 10 LLMs, as shown in Table 1. Evaluation Metrics in Table 1. We list 8 evaluation metrics in the experimental results. For each dataset, we randomly sampled 100 individuals, conducted 100 LLM queries in total, and reported the average results. The query prompt is almost the same as the Prompt 1, except that here we considered 5-level (i.e., strong disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree) for scoring scale instead of 3-level. As for each evaluation metric, here are detailed explanations: Generation Time (GT) measures the computational efficiency of each large language model by recording the average inference time required to produce responses. This metric is quantified in seconds and provides insight into the practical usability of different models, with lower values indicating faster processing speeds. Missing Rate (MR) quantifies the frequency at which language models fail to provide the requested scoring output due to limitations in their knowledge base. This metric is calculated as the percentage of instances where the model cannot generate proper response (with output score 0 - Unknown), highlighting gaps in the models capability to handle certain types of queries or domains. Indecisive Rate (IR) captures the proportion of responses where models express uncertainty or provide neutral answers rather than definitive judgments (with output score 2 - Neutral). This metric reflects"

            "content": "the models confidence level and willingness to make clear assessments, with higher rates indicating more cautious or uncertain behavior. Privacy Preservation (PP) evaluates the models ability to protect individual identities by effectively anonymizing personal information in its responses. This metric assesses how well the model handles sensitive data and maintains privacy standards while still providing meaningful analysis. For each response, if there contains any individual name information, return 0, otherwise return 1. Output Formatting (OF) measures adherence to specified response structure and format requirements. This metric evaluates whether the model consistently follows given instructions regarding how responses should be organized and presented, ensuring usability and consistency. For each response, if it absolutely follows the given instructions and the output template format, return 1, otherwise return 0. Context Consistency (CC) assesses the internal coherence between different components of the models response, specifically examining alignment between the analysis, assigned score, and provided justification. Factual Accuracy (FA) measures the absence of factual errors in the models output, evaluated through cross-validation using mutual critique between different language models. This metric is crucial for determining the reliability and trustworthiness of the generated content. Note that both CC and FA metrics were evaluated through generator-evaluator manner by 4 different evaluator LLMs (Gemini-2.5-Pro-Exp-03-25, Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental, ChatGPT4o-latest(2025-03-26), and Grok-3-Preview-02-24), to ensure logical consistency within responses. Basically, we collect the generated trait analysis output by 10 generator LLMs, and feed into other 4 evaluator LLMs. The evaluator LLMs will return 0 (indicating No) or 1 (indicating Yes). The evaluation prompt is presented in Prompt 2. There are mainly two reasons why we do not use human evaluators but instead choosing LLM evaluators: (1) First, human evaluator is expensive and costly; (2) Second, except loyal fans, most people may not have an in-depth understanding about celebrity or athlete. To that end, LLMs probably have seen more information about certain celebrity or athlete than normal human in general. Therefore, for factual accuracy evaluation, it is reasonable to use LLM evaluators. Note that in this way, we aim to point out any statement which absolutely violates the factuality or commonsense. As for evaluating context consistency, it turns out to be text interpretation task, it is also reasonable to apply LLMs. Overall Score (OS) provides comprehensive performance measure by calculating the average of all evaluation metrics except Generation Time. The score calculation is: OS = 1 6 [P + OF + CC + + (1 R) + (1 IR)]. (4) It offers holistic view of each models capabilities across the various assessment dimensions. Analysis. Table 1 presents comparative evaluation of 10 LLMs. ChatGPT-4o-Latest (Achiam et al., 2023) and Gemini-2.5-Pro (Team et al., 2023) achieved the highest overall scores. Performance is consistently stronger on CelebPersona than on AthlePersona, indicating that assessing athlete personalities is more challenging. This is particularly reflected in the higher MR on AthlePersona, which is possibly due to the limited public information available for younger or less prominent athletes. While GT varies substantially across models, both PP and OF are consistently strong. IR differs notably, e.g., 0.46 for Qwen-Plus (Bai et al., 2023) while 0.11 for DeepSeek-R1 (Liu et al., 2024), suggesting significant variation in models confidence calibration. A4.2 DETAILS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SCORING SCALE (REGARDING FIGURE 2) Prior research has demonstrated the importance of prompt engineering strategies in enhancing LLM performance across various tasks (Serapio-Garcıa et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Tseng et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a; Tang et al., 2025). These foundational studies have established that prompt structure and presentation significantly influence model outputs, particularly in psychological assessment applications. Building on this foundation, we systematically investigate how variations in scoring scale format affect the consistency of LLM-generated trait assessments across the Big Five traits, with implications for reliable automated psychological evaluation."

            "content": "How to Design Prompts? As shown in Fig. 2, the radar and box plots in the top and middle illustrate the extent of intra-prompt variability across the Big Five traits, while the bottom panel reports Manhattan distances between prompts to capture inter-prompt differences. Across both CelebPersona and AthlePersona datasets, Llama-4-Maverick (Touvron et al., 2023) stands In contrast, out for its highly stable outputs, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro (Team et al., 2023). Qwen2.5-Max (Bai et al., 2023) tends to produce the most variable results. Among these prompts, the Number-L3-Inc format consistently yields the lowest variance, suggesting that coarse, numerically formatted 3-point scales help LLMs produce more deterministic responses. Conversely, more complex prompts, especially those using Level-5 textual scales, lead to noticeably higher variability. Taken together, these findings suggest that prompt design, particularly scale granularity and formatting, plays critical role in shaping the reliability of LLM-based trait assessment. Experimental Design and Methodology in Figure 2). We evaluated five top-performing LLMs using structured prompt format [Number/Text]{[L3/L5]{[Inc/Dec], where elements specify response type (numerical vs. textual), scale granularity (3-level vs. 5-level), and ordering (increasing vs. decreasing). We list all different scoring scale in different prompts in Prompt 3. This systematic approach enables comprehensive analysis of how different formatting choices interact to influence model behavior. Each model was tested across 100 trials per prompt format on both CelebPersona and AthlePersona datasets, with temperature set to 0 to reduce stochastic variability (even though temperuture 0 will still have output variation) and isolate prompt-related effects. Consistency was quantified using standard deviation (std) of trait scores across repeated runs, providing direct measures of output stability. Comprehensive Analysis Framework. Our analysis encompasses three complementary perspectives as shown in Figure 2: (1) Top: trait-specific variability patterns through radar plots, (2) Middle: aggregate consistency measures via box plot distributions, and (3) Bottom: inter-prompt relationship quantification using Manhattan distance matrices. This multi-faceted approach provides both granular insights into individual trait reliability and broader patterns in prompt format effectiveness. Model Performance Hierarchy and Stability Patterns. The analysis reveals clear performance hierarchy among evaluated models. Llama-4-Maverick demonstrates exceptional consistency with standard deviations consistently below 0.2 across all prompt formats and behavior traits, forming tight, regular polygons in radar plots that indicate robust internal mechanisms for maintaining consistent assessments. The models box plots show minimal variability between prompt formats with few outliers, suggesting sophisticated handling of diverse input structures. Gemini-2.5-Pro occupies an intermediate position with generally low variability but occasional sensitivity to specific prompt formats, evidenced by longer box plot whiskers and more distributed quartiles. The model shows particular stability with numerical formats while demonstrating increased variance with textual scales, indicating format-dependent reliability patterns. ChatGPT-4o-Latest exhibits moderate consistency overall but with notable prompt-dependent variations, particularly visible through outliers in box plot distributions. While generally reliable, certain prompt-model-trait combinations produce unexpectedly high variability, suggesting sensitivity to specific formatting choices. Grok-3-Beta shows concerning instability, particularly in AthlePersona where some prompt formats yield standard deviations exceeding 0.8. Wide interquartile ranges indicate dramatic consistency variations depending on prompt format, with pronounced radar plot irregularities revealing trait-specific vulnerabilities. Qwen2.5-Max consistently ranks as the least reliable model, exhibiting high median standard deviations and extensive outliers reaching above 1.0. The models radar plots often show expanded, irregular shapes indicating inconsistent performance across traits, with Manhattan distances exceeding 2.0 for complex formats. Trait-Specific Consistency Patterns. The radar plot analysis reveals compelling trait-specific reliability patterns. Openness emerges as the most stable trait across nearly all models and prompt formats, consistently showing standard deviations below 0.3. This stability suggests that LLMs demonstrate inherent consistency when evaluating creative and intellectual characteristics, possibly due to clearer linguistic markers for openness-related traits in training data. Neuroticism presents notable dataset dependency, showing moderate stability in CelebPersona but considerably higher variability in AthlePersona, particularly for less stable models where standard deviations can exceed 1.0. This context-dependent pattern indicates that evaluation domain significantly influences how models interpret emotional stability markers. Extraversion and Agreeableness exhibit"

The geometric shapes formed by different prompt formats in radar plots reveal systematic differences: simpler formats tend to create smaller, more regular polygons, while complex textual formats often produce irregular, expanded shapes indicating inconsistent cross-trait performance. Format Optimization and Complexity Trade-offs. The Number-L3-Inc format consistently yields the lowest variance across models and datasets, demonstrating that simple numerical 3-level scales enhance deterministic responses. Box plot analyses show this format produces the tightest distributions with minimal outliers across all models. Manhattan distance matrices reveal that Number-L3-Inc and Number-L3-Dec formats show consistently low inter-prompt distances (often below 1.0), indicating that scale direction has minimal impact when using simple numerical formats. Conversely, textual 5-level formats (Text-L5-Inc/Dec) produce significantly higher variability, with standard deviations often exceeding 0.5 and Manhattan distances reaching above 2.0 between prompt pairs. This indicates that textual formats not only increase intra-prompt variability but fundamentally alter response distributions compared to numerical approaches. The increased granularity of 5-level scales appears to introduce additional decision boundaries that models interpret inconsistently. Number-L5 formats show intermediate complexity, exhibiting distances that fall between L3 numerical formats and textual formats. This suggests that 5-level scales represent transitional complexity levelmore challenging than 3-level scales but not as fundamentally different as textual ones. Cross-Dataset Insights and Domain Effects. Systematic comparison between CelebPersona and AthlePersona reveals important domain-dependent patterns. AthlePersona generally produces higher standard deviations and inter-prompt distances across most models, suggesting that athlete trait assessment presents inherent challenges for LLMs. This pattern may reflect training data biases, where celebrity personalities are more extensively documented in text corpora compared to athlete psychological profiles, leading to less robust assessment capabilities in athletic contexts. Implications and Final Model Selection. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about measurement precision in automated assessment contexts. Counter-intuitively, reducing scale granularity and employing numerical rather than textual formats substantially improves reliability, suggesting that cognitive complexity reduction outweighs precision benefits of more detailed scales. Based on our comprehensive analysis across multiple evaluation dimensions, we made the following strategic selections for our trait generation framework: After careful consideration of the consistency patterns, trait-specific reliability, and cross-dataset performance, we chose the Number-L3-Inc format as our standardized prompt structure. This format demonstrated the lowest variance across all models and datasets, with standard deviations consistently below 0.3 and minimal inter-prompt distances, ensuring maximum reliability in automated trait assessment. For model selection, we adopted multi-model approach incorporating Llama-4-Maverick, ChatGPT-4o-Latest, and Gemini-2.5-Pro. Llama-4-Maverick serves as our primary model due to its exceptional consistency (std 0.2) across all traits and formats. ChatGPT-4o-Latest provides complementary reliability with moderate consistency and broad accessibility, while Gemini-2.5-Pro offers additional validation particularly for numerical format processing. This ensemble approach leverages the strengths of multiple models while mitigating individual model limitations observed in our analysis. Notably, we excluded Grok-3-Beta and Qwen2.5-Max from our final selection due to their concerning instability patterns, with standard deviations frequently exceeding 0.8 and inconsistent cross-trait performance that could compromise assessment reliability. The observed trait-specific and dataset-dependent variations underscore the critical importance of careful prompt design in LLM-based psychological evaluation systems. The convergent evidence across radar plots, box plot distributions, and distance matrices demonstrates that prompt engineering represents fundamental factor in determining assessment reliability, with implications extending beyond trait evaluation to broader automated psychological assessment applications. A5 DETAILS ABOUT INDEPENDENT TEST (IT) RESULTS To evaluate independence relationships across different variable types in our analysis, we employ five statistical testing methods. For discrete variables, we utilize two classical approaches: the Chi-square test (Tallarida et al., 1987), which evaluates statistical independence between categorical variables, and the G-square test (Tsamardinos et al., 2006), likelihood-ratio variant that demonstrates improved"

For continuous and mixed variable types, we implement three kernel-based methods: the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2005), which measures dependence in high-dimensional data using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces; the Randomized Conditional Independence Test (RCIT) (Strobl et al., 2019), non-parametric approach that employs randomized Fourier features to approximate kernel-based conditional independence testing; and the Kernel-based Conditional Independence Test (KCI) (Zhang et al., 2012), which extends HSIC methodology for testing conditional independence in complex data structures. This comprehensive suite of methods enables robust independence testing across diverse data types encountered in our experimental framework. dependency is deemed significant if < 0.05, and each cell in Fig. 3(a)/(b) shows the number of methods that detect such significance, and we summarize these 5 methods in Table A3 and Table A4. A5.1 DETAILS ON VOTING AND AGGREGATION As described in the main paper, trait scores for each individual are obtained from three LLMs, which generate text descriptions that are mapped into Big Five trait scores. These outputs are then combined into single score per trait using two-step aggregation procedure. First, we discard any score of 0 (denoting Insufficient Information) to retain only confident assessments. Second, among the remaining values, we take the median, rounding up when necessary. This median-based rule is more robust to outliers than simple mean. Example. Suppose three LLMs output scores [2, 3, 0] for Extraversion. After discarding the 0, the remaining scores are [2, 3]. The median is 2.5, which we round up to 3 as the final aggregated trait. For CelebPersona, each individual is associated with multiple images annotated with binary facial attributes (e.g., Big Nose, High Cheekbones). Since different images may yield different attribute values, we aggregate them by majority voting across all available images. If the votes are unequal, the majority determines the attribute value: 1 for Absent and +1 for Present. In the case of an exact tie (equal votes), we assign the value 0, denoting an indeterminate outcome. This process ensures that each celebrity has consistent, person-level attribute vector, while explicitly flagging ambiguous cases. Overall, this aggregation strategy increases robustness by filtering uncertain outputs, reducing sensitivity to outliers, and providing interpretable features at the individual level."

Agreeableness shows the most consistent evidence of demographic sensitivity, particularly with birth timing variables, though significant relationships (p < 0.05) remain infrequent across methods. Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Neuroticism demonstrate predominantly dependent relationships with demographic features, with p-values typically samller than 0.05 across most variable-method combinations. Particularly, league affiliation, geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude), and birth year show consistent results, with most methods yielding very low p-values (near 0.000) suggesting dependence, while birth month and birth day produce high p-values indicating independence. The multi-method validation approach reveals important methodological insights about dependency detection reliability. Classical categorical tests (CSQ, GSQ) occasionally detect marginal associations that kernel-based methods (RCIT, HSIC, KCI) fail to identify, suggesting method-specific sensitivities rather than robust dependencies. The independence test heatmap shows mixed results: some variables like birth month, birth day, and height demonstrate low consensus scores (0-2 out of 5 methods achieving 0.05), indicating weak or inconsistent dependencies. However, several variabletrait combinations achieve moderate to high consensus scores, primarily involving league, latitude, longitude, and weight. This pattern suggests nuanced relationship where certain demographic factors (geographic and league-related variables) show more consistent associations with behavior traits in athletic populations than temporal or physical characteristics. The dependencies between Big Five behavior traits and league, latitude, longitude, and weight in athletic populations likely reflect complex interplay of self-selection, environmental influences, and sport-specific demands. League affiliations may attract distinct behavior trait profilesteam sports favoring extraversion and agreeableness for collaboration, while individual sports might select for conscientiousness and controlled neuroticism. Geographic variables (latitude/longitude) capture regional cultural differences in values like individualism versus collectivism, as well as environmental factors such as climate that research has linked to behavior trait development. Weight dependencies may emerge through multiple pathways: conscientiousness influencing self-regulation of diet and exercise, neuroticism affecting stress-related eating behaviors, openness driving willingness to experiment with training regimens, and sport-specific body type requirements that indirectly link physical characteristics to the behavior traits favored in those sports. These relationships represent genuine demographic-trait associations rather than statistical noise because they align with theoretically plausible mechanisms involving cultural adaptation, environmental pressures, and the mutual influence between behavior traits and lifestyle choices in elite athletic contexts. A5.3 DETAILS ABOUT IT RESULTS OF CELEBPERSONA Figure A4 shows heatmaps of p-values from different statistical independence tests evaluating the relationship between facial/demographic features and Big Five personality traits in the CelebPersona dataset. Features like birth year, gender, occupation, latitude, longitude, pointy nose and big lips frequently show strong associations with Big Five traits. In contrast, attributes like birth day, narrow eyes and bushy eyebrows generally appear independent of traits. The CelebPersona dataset reveals several robust dependency patterns with p-values consistently below 0.05 across multiple methods. Birth timing variables demonstrate the strongest dependencies: birth day shows significant associations with openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion across kernelbased methods, suggesting developmental timing effects on trait formation. Birth month exhibits dependencies with conscientiousness and moderate associations across other traits. Among facial features, big nose demonstrates consistent dependencies with conscientiousness across kernel methods, while bushy eyebrows shows significant associations with openness and extraversion. Weight exhibits notable dependencies with agreeableness and neuroticism, indicating body composition-trait linkages. Narrow eyes shows dependencies with conscientiousness and agreeableness, while oval face demonstrates associations with neuroticism and other traits.

The dependency patterns in celebrity populations reveal intriguing domain-specific insights that distinguish them from general populations. The pronounced birth timing effects, particularly the strong associations between birth day and multiple behavior traits, suggest that developmental timing may interact with entertainment industry selection pressures in unique ways. Celebrities born on certain days may possess behavior configurations that enhance their ability to navigate public scrutiny, media attention, and performance demands.

A6 THEOREMS AND PROOFS In this section, we will present more details about the theorems and their proofs. In Theorem 1, We begin by showing how the modality-specific latent subspaces [zm, s], where zm is modality-specific latent variables and is modality-shared latent variables, can be recovered in nonparametric manner using multiple measurements. Building on this result, then in Theorem 2, we demonstrate the identifiability of the shared latent variable by leveraging the information across multiple modalities. Finally in Theorem 3,, conditioned on the recovered s, we establish the identifiability of each modality-specific latent variable zm up to minor indeterminacies, i.e., component-wise identifiability with an inner-modality permutation. The logical dependencies among the theorems are summarized in the flowchart as shown in Figure A5. A6.1 PROOF OF THEOREM 1 Theorem 1. (Identifiability of Subspace) Under the causal model described above, if the estimated observations matches the true joint distribution of any {xm,A, xm,B, xm,C} (they are exchangable) which are three measurements draw from one modality, and: (Well-Posed Probability): The joint, marginal, and conditional distributions of (xm,B, zm) are all bounded and continuous. ii (Modality Variability): The operators Lxm,C zm and Lxm,Axm,C are injective. iii (Measurement Changes): For any z(1) Zt where z(1) = z(2) , z(2) , we have p(xm,Bz(1) ) = p(xm,Bz(2) , s). iv (Differentiability): There exists functional such that (cid:2)pxm,B zm,s( zm, s)(cid:3) = h(zm, s) for all zm Zm and S, where is differentiable. Then we have [ˆzm, ˆs] = h(zm, s), where is an invertible and differentiable function. Importantly, Theorem 1 is not limited to the use of Discussion on Insufficient Measurements. multiple measurements within single modality for recovering latent variables. It also reveals that, when the number of measurements in one modality is insufficient (i.e., fewer than 3), additional modalities can provide complementary information, provided that the required assumptions are met. We first introduce another operator to represent the point-wise distributional transformation. To maintain generality, we denote two variables as and b, with respective support sets and B."

(28) By Assumption iii, different wm corresponds to different pxm,B wm(xm,B wm), there is no repeated element in {pxm,B wm (xm,B wm)} (and {pxm,B ˆwm(xm,B ˆwm)}). Hence, the relabelling map is one-to-one (invertible). Furthermore, Assumption 4 implies that pxm,B wm (xm,B h(wm)) determines unique h(wm). The same holds for the pxm,B ˆwm (xm,B ˆwm), implying that pxm,B wm (xm,B h(wm)) = pxm,B ˆwm(xm,B ˆwm) = ˆwm = h(wm). (29) Next, Assumption iv implies that the function must be differentiable. Since the VAE is differentiable, we can learn differentiable function that satisfies Assumption iv. Consider ˆwm related to wm via ˆwm = h(wm).

A6.2 PROOF OF THEOREM Theorem 1 establishes that the modality-specific latent variables wm are block-wise identifiable. Given multiple instances of block-wise identifiability for [zm, s] across different modalities m, the shared component is expected to be identifiable as well. To support this insight, we first present related lemma from multi-view causal representation learning. Lemma 1 (Identifiability from Set of Views (Yao et al., 2023)). Consider set of modality observations xm that satisfy Assumption 2.1 in (Yao et al., 2023). Suppose there exists set of modalityspecific encoders, each mapping to common latent space. Let ˆg1 denote family of encoders aimed xk (xk)(cid:1) . at recovering the shared latent variables by minimizing the total entropy: (cid:80) Then, under the stated assumptions, the shared latent variables are block-identifiable. k[M ] (cid:0)ˆg1 xk Theorem 2.

            "content": "Proof. We now relate our results to Lemma 1. In (Yao et al., 2023), identifiability is established under the assumption that multiple measurement views are available for shared latent space, and that each measurement process is invertible. This setting guarantees block identifiability of the latent space by aligning the outputs of modality-specific encoders. Specifically, for each modality m, we have: [ˆzm, ˆs] = h(zm, s), (31) where the key insight is that ˆs corresponds to the shared component across all modality-specific representations wm, extracted via their respective encoders. Furthermore, Lemma 1 establishes that any set of encoders minimizing the total entropy (cid:88) (cid:0)ˆg1 xk (xk)(cid:1) k[M ] (32) can recover the ground-truth shared latent variables from each modality xm m, up to bijective transformation hs: ˆs = hs(s). (33) That is, the shared latent content is block-identified from the multi-view observations {xm}m[M ]. Finally, since each modality-specific latent variable zm is causally influenced by the shared component s, we may apply the identifiability conditions in (Von Kugelgen et al., 2021) as base case. This allows us to further identify zm up to modality-specific bijection hz: ˆzm = hz(zm). (34) Hence, both the shared latent component and the modality-specific components zm are blockidentifiable. In the final step of our proof, we build on the identifiability result from (Yao et al., Discussion. 2023), which assumes that multiple invertible measurement processes are available to recover the shared latent variables. In contrast, our framework relaxes this assumption by not requiring each measurement process to be invertible. Instead, Theorem 1 ensures block identifiability of each modality-specific latent variable wm by exploiting the information-sharing structure inherent in multi-modal and multi-measurement settings. We further leverage structural prior where the shared component is common cause of the modality-specific variables, rather than an effect. This causal asymmetry eliminates the need for stronger conditions such as global optimization or invariance constraints. Consequently, the conditions in (Von Kugelgen et al., 2021) apply, providing identifiability guarantees for the modality-specific latent variables zm. A6.3 PROOF OF THEOREM 3 We begin by presenting useful lemma from (Zhang et al., 2024), which connects group-wise transformations to component-wise transformations in Markov network. This lemma is instrumental for the subsequent proof, in particular, it enables us to first recover the latent variables within groups of adjacent nodes in the Markov network. Lemma 2 (Identifiability of Hidden Causal Variables). If zi is function of at most one of ˆzk and ˆzl, and given that zi and zj are adjacent in Markov network Mz, at most one of them is function of ˆzk or ˆzl.

It is worth noting that in many cases, the above result already enables us to recover some of the hidden variables up to component-wise transformation, that is, ˆz,i = hi(z,π(j)), where hi is an invertible function. We next present proposition that shows how an arbitrary permutation over all components can be resolved into permutation within each modality block. Proposition 1.

Discussion. We demonstrate that multi-modality information enables the use of the shared confounder as continuous conditional prior over the modality-specific latent variables zm. This represents the key distinction from conventional multi-modality or multi-view frameworks (Sun et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2023; Von Kugelgen et al., 2021). By conditioning on sfor example, gene-level representationwe can achieve component-wise identifiability of latent variables and recover their causal graph under milder assumptions. Furthermore, Proposition 1 shows that the modality-specific latent structure zm, obtained via Theorem 2, facilitates the resolution of permutation indeterminacies across the latent spaces associated with different modalities.

The details are given as follows. Network Architecture. For the high-dimensional data, we use large foundation model to extract high-dimensional feature first, and then use the 3-layer multi-layer perception (MLP) for the encoders and decoders. Specifically, for image data, we utilize ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023) to extract 1024-dimensional embedding vectors, as this model excels at multi-modal embedding extraction. For text descriptions, we employ the gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct model from Alibaba (Bai et al., 2023), which is specifically designed for long-sentence embedding tasks and demonstrates superior performance in capturing semantic representations from extended textual content. After this gte model, we will get 3584-dimensional embedding vector for each input text description. Encoder and decoder. Each modality xm is given as an input to the corresponding encoder and outputs the estimated modality-specific latent ˆzm, exogenous variables ˆηm, and shared latent variables across different modalities.

Conditional independence constraints. We enforce the conditional independence condition xm,j xm,k zm (where xm,j and xm,k refer to the j-th and k-th measurements in m-th modality) and the independence condition on ηm zm by enforcing the independence among components in γ = [{ˆzm}M i=1]. To implement it, we assume that γ follows an independent prior distribution p(γ), such as standard isotropic Gaussian, and enforce the independence by matching the distribution of ˆγ to the prior distribution. Specifically, we minimize the KL divergence between the posterior and Gaussian prior distribution as follows: m=1, {ˆηm}M m=1, {ˆϵi}dz LInd = KL(p(γ)N (0, I)). Proposition 2 (Conditional Independence Condition). Denote xm,j and xm,k are two different measurements in one modality for the m-th modality with modality-specific latent variable zm. zm is the set of block-identified latent variables, and ηm η are exogenous variables in modality m. We have xm,j xm,k zm ϵm,j ϵm,k. Proposition 3 (Independent Noise Condition). Denote and η as the block-identified latent variables and exogenous variables across all modalities. ϵs are the causally-related noise terms. We have η η ϵ. Sparsity regularization. We use normalization flow (Huang et al., 2018) to estimate the exogenous variables ϵ and implement the causal relations through learnable adjacency matrix ˆA. The binary values in ˆA represent the causal generation process between latent variables, e.g. ˆAi,j = 1 indicates ˆzj is the parent of ˆzi, while ˆAi,j = 0 means ˆzj dose not contribute to the generation of ˆzi. For each component ˆzi, we select its parents Pa(ˆzi) based on the estimated causal adjacency matrix, and apply the flow transformation from Pa(ˆzi) to ˆϵi. To encourage sparsity among the latent variables ˆz, we introduce regularization term on the learned adjacency matrix. The sparsity assumption indicates that the optimal causal graph should be the minimal one which still allows the model to successfully match the ground truth observational distribution. In particular, we reduce the dependencies between different components of ˆz by adding L1 penalty on the adjacency matrix, s.t., LSp = ˆA1.

For colored MNIST, we define horizontal position as latent cause that influences image transparency, where digits are positioned at different horizontal locations and their transparency varies accordingly. For fashion MNIST, we establish vertical position as latent cause that affects grayscale intensity of the clothing items. The causal structure connects these modalities through cross-modal relationship: the horizontal position in colored MNIST serves as causal factor for the vertical position in fashion MNIST, creating meaningful intermodal dependency. Notably, our dataset design reflects different measurement characteristics across modalities: for fashion MNIST, each sample contains single image representing one measurement, while for colored MNIST, we generate three images with different background colors (red, green, blue) for each sample, providing three distinct measurements that capture different aspects of the same underlying latent variables. The generated image examples are shown in Figure 5(a). The key hyper-parameters are listed in Table A7. Ground Truth Causal Graph and Training Configuration. The underlying causal relationships in our synthetic dataset are illustrated in Figure 5(b). The causal graph demonstrates how latent variables within and across modalities interact: horizontal position in colored MNIST causally influences both the image transparency within the same modality and the vertical position in fashion MNIST across modalities. Subsequently, the vertical position in fashion MNIST determines the grayscale intensity of the fashion items. This carefully designed causal structure enables us to evaluate whether our method can correctly identify and disentangle these known causal relationships from the observed multi-modal data. A8.2 DETAILS ABOUT RESULTS AND ANALYSIS We compare our approach against several baseline methods including MCL, BetaVAE, and MMCRL using two key metrics: R2 (coefficient of determination) and MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient). As shown in Figure Figure 5(c), our method consistently outperforms all baseline approaches across both evaluation metrics. Specifically, our approach achieves R2 scores of 0.96 and MCC scores of 0.92, demonstrating superior performance in both regression and classification tasks for causal variable identification. The substantial improvement over strong baselines like MMCRL (R2 = 0.90, MCC = 0.85) validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework in learning causally meaningful representations from multi-modal observations. These results confirm that our method successfully captures the underlying causal structure while maintaining high fidelity in representation learning, even when dealing with asymmetric measurement structures across different modalities.

A9.2 DETAILS ABOUT RESULTS AND ANALYSIS We interpret the shared latent variables S1, S2, and S3 as representing education, cultural background, and growing environment, respectively. Notably, S2 influences Z2,4, which we interpret as cultural background shaping ones language use, while S3 influences Z2,1, suggesting that the growing environment affects the use of positive language. Furthermore, expressiveness (Z2,5) is found to causally influence approachability (Z1,10), reinforcing the idea that ones ability to convey emotions plays key role in how approachable they appear. On the visual side, we observe that variations in event context (Z1,5) and lighting conditions (Z1,3) lead to changes in hairstyle (Z1,4), which in turn influence face visibility (Z1,8), overall style (Z1,6), and how good-looking (Z1,7) the person appears. To validate our example, we conducted an RCIT test between the Big Five traits (Final to Final N) and two sets of latent variables: five derived from trait descriptions across both datasets. We also carry out the same tests on ten facial attributes from CelebPersona and ten latent variables derived facial images. As shown in Figure A7 (a), confidence (Z2,1) exhibits strong statistical dependence with Openness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness. In contrast, Self-awareness (Z2,4) is significantly associated only with Extraversion, suggesting that more extraverted individuals tend to be more self-aware, likely due to their expressiveness, social engagement, and sensitivity. For the test result of CelebPersona in Figure A7 (b), positive language use (Z2,1) has significant dependence with Agreeableness indicates that more agreeable individuals are likely to use warmer and more positive language, aligning with their prosocial and empathetic tendencies. On the other hand, the high p-values across all Big Five traits suggest that expressiveness (Z2,5) operates independently of stable behavior trait dimensions in this dataset, possibly reflecting more situational or behavior factors not captured by self-reported traits. In Figure A7 (c), the p-value heatmap confirms that many facial attributes are significantly influenced by latent appearance factors like clothing style (Z1,1), lighting (Z1,3), and event context (Z1,5), as shown in the causal graph. Traits like Big Nose, Pointy Nose, and Oval Face are tightly linked to hairstyle and good looking (Z1,7)."
