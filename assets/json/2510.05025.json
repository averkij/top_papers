            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) (Jiang et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) have demonstrated susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks that can manipulate LLMs to generate harmful outputs. While jailbreaking attacks (Qi et al., 2024) on images generally adopt imperceptible adversarial perturbations, existing textual jailbreaking attacks (Zou et al., 2023; Andriushchenko et al., 2025) operate under an implicit assumption that jailbreak prompts are constructed by visibly modifying malicious questions. Specifically, whether these methods rely on manually designed prompt templates (Shen et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023a) or automated algorithms (Zou et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2025), they consistently involve the insertion of human-perceptible characters into the original malicious questions. In this paper, we introduce imperceptible jailbreaks by using set of Unicode characters, i.e., variation selectors (Butler, 2025). Variation selectors are originally designed to specify glyph variants for some special characters, such as changing emojis in different colors. Instead, we demonstrate that they can be repurposed to form invisible adversarial suffixes appended to malicious questions for jailbreaks. While these characters are imperceptible on screen, they occupy textual space that tokenizers of LLMs can encode. For instance, given string such as Hello World appended with variation selectors, it will appear as the same Hello World but meanwhile introduces additional invisible characters that can be encoded by the tokenizer. By leveraging these invisible variation selectors, we can construct adversarial suffixes that render jailbreak prompts visually indistinguishable from their original malicious counterparts on screen. To optimize such suffixes, we propose chain-of-search pipeline by maximizing the log-likelihood of target-start tokens (e.g., Sure) for harmful responses. Concretely, we start with randomly initialized invisible suffixes and candidate target-start tokens, and use random search (Andriushchenko et al., 2025) to discover effective combinations for each malicious question. Successful suffixes and target-start tokens are then reused as initialization points in subsequent search rounds on previously failed malicious questions. We perform this bootstrapped procedure in multiple rounds. Work done during Kuofeng Gaos internship at Sea AI Lab. Correspondence to Yiming Li and Tianyu Pang."

            "content": "Figure 1: An illustrative comparison between an original malicious question and our imperceptible jailbreak prompt. Although both appear visually identical when rendered on screen, the jailbreak version includes invisible suffixes composed of variation selectors. These invisible characters can be encoded by LLM tokenizers as additional tokens, necessary to bypass safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our imperceptible jailbreaks can achieve high attack success rates against four aligned LLMs without producing any visible modifications in the written prompt. Our optimized invisible suffixes play crucial role in redirecting model attention away from the original malicious question and toward the invisible suffixes, thereby steering the model toward generating unsafe completions. Notably, our method can also generalize to prompt injection scenarios. Figure 1 illustrates that our imperceptible jailbreak prompt with invisible suffixes is visually identical to the original malicious question on screen but is tokenized differently by LLMs, enabling effective adversarial manipulation to jailbreak LLMs. In summary, our main contributions are three-fold: We explore how to construct jailbreak prompts exclusively through invisible modifications to original malicious questions. For the first time, we show that invisible variation selectors can be adversarially optimized to circumvent LLM safety alignment. We introduce chain-of-search pipeline to enable the effective optimization of imperceptible adversarial suffixes. We demonstrate that our imperceptible jailbreaks achieve high attack success rates against four aligned LLMs while remaining visually indistinguishable from original malicious questions on screen, and this method can be extended to prompt injection attacks as well."

            "content": "Jailbreaking attacks on LLMs. Existing jailbreaking attacks fall into two categories: manual and automated jailbreaks. Manual jailbreaks (Li et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2025) handcraft jailbreak prompts that exploit model inherent limitations, such as in-context demonstrations of harmful content (Wei et al., 2023b), multilingual translations (Yong et al., 2023), or programmatic scenarios (Kang et al., 2024). Automated jailbreaks instead rely on optimization techniques (Zheng et al., 2024; Kong et al., 2025; Zhang & Wei, 2025) or leverage the capabilities of LLMs (Yu et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024; Takemoto, 2024; Jin et al., 2024) to assist in crafting jailbreaks. For example, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) (Zou et al., 2023) optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce unsafe completions, and I-GCG (Jia et al., 2025) improves its convergence and success rates through multi-coordinate updates and an easy-to-hard initialization strategy.

            "content": "Figure 2: Variation selectors are originally designed to alter the appearance of special characters, but they do not influence the appearance of standard characters, like normal alphabetic characters. Hence, we can use these invisible variation selectors to achieve imperceptible jailbreaks. driushchenko et al., 2025) combine carefully crafted prompt with random search to elicit static affirmative token (e.g., Sure) for harmful responses. Unlike prior approaches that visibly alter malicious questions, we show that invisible characters can also guide LLM unsafe outputs while leaving the on-screen appearance of the original malicious question unchanged. Imperceptible attacks on textual modality. Prior work on imperceptible text-based attacks investigates adversarial perturbations that preserve the on-screen appearance of text while manipulating underlying encodings. For instance, Boucher et al. (2022) introduce broad class of imperceptible encoding perturbations, including zero-width characters (e.g., U+200B), homoglyphs, and control characters for deletions and reordering. They show that each of these modifications to embed inputs can degrade machine translation, toxic content classifiers, and search engines. Building on this line of work, HYPOCRITE (Kim et al., 2022) proposes to perturb every unit of input texts with homoglyphs to generate adversarial examples for sentiment analysis, while SilverSpeak (Creo & Pudasaini, 2025) applies homoglyph substitutions to evade AI-text detectors. In contrast to these approaches, we exploit variation selectors as the basis for imperceptible perturbations. In particular, variation selectors are more numerous than zero-width or control characters, providing richer perturbation space. Moreover, unlike homoglyphs that can only substitute characters at their fixed positions in the input, variation selectors can be flexibly appended to arbitrary positions. Finally, while prior studies primarily aim to reduce model utility or evade AI-text detection, our work aims to jailbreak aligned LLMs by inducing unsafe outputs."

Besides, we propose chain-of-search pipeline to construct the imperceptible jailbreak prompts. 3.1 VARIATION SELECTORS Unicode is universal character encoding standard that represents the worlds writing systems in consistent way. Each character is assigned number, also known as codepoint. In many cases, there exists straightforward one-to-one relationship between these codepoints and visual characters rendered on screen. Existing jailbreaking attacks typically use these visible characters to modify malicious questions to generate jailbreak prompts. These visible modifications (Jia et al., 2025; Andriushchenko et al., 2025) have been shown to be effective in eliciting harmful outputs. However, in addition to these visible characters, Unicode defines 256 invisible variation selectors (Butler, 2025), including two contiguous ranges: the original 16 selectors (U+FE00U+FE0F) and an extended set of 240 supplementary selectors (U+E0100U+E01EF). Variation selectors are originally designed to modify the appearance of the preceding character, creating visual distinctions for some special characters. As shown in Figure 2, the variation selector U+EF0F can change the appearance of check mark, transforming it from text symbol to colored emoji. However, when"

Although they render no visible symbol attached with standard characters, each variation selector is itself valid codepoint and they are also retained during typical text operations such as copying and pasting. This persistence makes them ideal for being embedded within normal text to carry hidden data. Crucially, these variation selectors can be processed by LLM tokenizers, which typically encode them as corresponding fixed multi-token block per variation selector. This property allows them to manipulate the output of LLMs without altering the visual appearance of an input text. Table 1 demonstrates the token IDs of some example variation selectors under different LLM tokenizers. Building on these properties, rather than employing single variation selector to modify the rendering of special characters, we propose to concatenate multiple variation selectors to malicious questions to mount imperceptible jailbreaks for LLMs. 3.2 CHAIN OF SEARCH To craft imperceptible jailbreak prompts using variation selectors, we formulate this task as random search problem (Andriushchenko et al., 2025). Given malicious question Q, we append suffix of invisible characters to form composite prompt = S. The optimization iteratively modifies contiguous variation selectors at random positions within S, accepting changes that increase the log-likelihood of target-start token in the LLMs output. Since most of 256 variation selectors are mapped to fixed multi-token block, as shown in Table 2, modifying single variation selector affects multiple consecutive tokens. This leads to much more limited search space compared to traditional token-level optimization methods, where the entire tokenizer vocabulary can be leveraged, and individual tokens can be independently fine-tuned. To address the issue, we propose chain-of-search pipeline. Concretely, we randomly initialize suffix composed of variation selectors and define candidate set of plausible target-start tokens. For each malicious question Q, we independently perform random search to optimize suffix that promotes one of these target-start tokens in iterations. Among the attempted prompts, subset can succeed in eliciting harmful responses from the LLM. From these successes, we extract both the optimized suffixes and their corresponding effective target-start tokens. These successful suffixes and target-start tokens are retained as new initialization for previously unsuccessful malicious questions for the next random search in iterations. This bootstrapped procedure is applied iteratively in rounds. An algorithm summary of our imperceptible jailbreaks is provided in Appendix A."

Simple adaptive attacks involve carefully crafted template and visible non-semantic suffix added to malicious questions. I-GCG appends visible non-semantic suffix to malicious questions. In contrast, our imperceptible jailbreaks combine malicious questions with suffixes consisting of invisible variation selectors, resulting in jailbreak prompt that appears identical to the malicious question when rendered on screen. Difference from simple adaptive attacks and I-GCG. Simple adaptive attacks (Andriushchenko et al., 2025) and I-GCG (Jia et al., 2025) both reuse successful suffixes to initialize other failed malicious questions, similar to our imperceptible jailbreaks. We clarify the difference between our approach and theirs. In particular, both simple adaptive attacks and our imperceptible jailbreaks rely on random search. Due to the visible, carefully crafted prompt template and the ability to fine-tune each token with all visible characters, simple adaptive attacks can fix single target-start token to optimize suffixes for all malicious questions. In contrast, our method is restricted to limited set of invisible variation selectors, which requires instance-specific suffix initialization and target-start tokens during optimization. In addition, I-GCG departs from random search by employing gradientguided GCG and leveraging visible suffixes to construct jailbreak prompts. Figure 3 illustrates the differences among the jailbreak prompts produced by these three methods."

Specifically, I-GCG appends clearly visible suffixes to malicious questions, whereas simple adaptive attacks incorporate crafted prompt templates combined with visually noticeable alterations. In contrast, our method leverages invisible variation selectors, resulting in jailbreak prompts indistinguishable from the original ones when displayed on screen. Lastly, we include two key baselines, including the original malicious questions without any perturbation and randomly inserted variation selectors. Both baselines yield significantly lower ASRs, confirming that our chain-of-search optimization is crucial for crafting effective imperceptible jailbreaks. 4.3 ABLATION STUDY Distribution of target-start tokens. key component of our imperceptible jailbreaks is the promotion of specific target-start tokens in the models output. To assess how these tokens contribute to successful jailbreaks, we analyze the distribution of target-start tokens across four aligned LLMs in Figure 4. Concretely, in Vicuna-13B-v1.5, the tokens To, Here, and Sure collectively account for over 50% of all successful jailbreaks. Besides, in Llama-2-Chat-7B, Sure and Here are dominant, while Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B tends to favor To and I. These indicate strong bias toward these affirmative tokens for these three models. Interestingly, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 produces more task-structured responses, often beginning with 1 or Title, suggesting preference for list-style or title-style completions. This motivates our imperceptible jailbreaks to maintain pool of target tokens rather than relying on single static choice. Distribution of round numbers. Our chain-of-search strategy iteratively refines suffixes by leveraging successful adversarial components across multiple rounds. To understand how early in the chain success tends to emerge, we plot the distribution of successful jailbreaks by round number in Figure 5. For Vicuna-13B-v1.5 and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, most successful jailbreaks occur within the first two rounds, indicating relatively simple optimization landscape where early bootstraps are already effective. Conversely, for Llama-2-Chat-7B and Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B, successful jailbreaks are more concentrated in the second to fourth rounds, suggesting these models require additional refinement and benefit more substantially from the iterative bootstrapping mechanism. Distribution of restart numbers. Following prior work (Zeng et al., 2024; Andriushchenko et al., 2025), we incorporate multiple random restarts to leverage different generations with temperature one to enhance the attack. In Figure 6, we report the number of restarts needed to obtain successful jailbreaks. Specifically, Vicuna-13B-v1.5 tends to succeed within three restarts, while Llama-2Chat-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 typically require up to ten restarts. Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B exhibits higher average restart count, underscoring its comparatively more robust alignment and the increased difficulty in crafting effective invisible suffixes. Ablation on suffix length and number of modified characters . We further conduct controlled ablation on two key hyperparameters, i.e., the suffix length and the number of variation selectors modified per iteration. In Figure 7, we report the average log-probability of target-start tokens over the first 1, 000 search iterations. For Vicuna-13B-v1.5, Llama-2-Chat-7B, and Mistral-"

The results suggest that moderate suffix length with moderate modified step offers an optimal performance for the effectiveness and optimization stability. Figure 8: Attention score distribution under our imperceptible jailbreaks. Blue tokens promote refusal and red tokens promote acceptance. For the original malicious question, the models attention focuses on harmful phrases. In contrast, under imperceptible jailbreak prompts, attention shifts away from harmful content, which can bypass the safety alignment. 7B-Instruct-v0.2, the configuration of = 800 and = 10 yields the highest improvement in log-likelihood. In contrast, Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B benefits from longer suffix of = 1, 200 while still favoring = 10. This suggests balance between search space size and optimization efficiency. Namely, moderate suffix length allows enough capacity to induce successful attacks, while step size of = 10 enables steady exploration without destabilizing progress. 4.4 DISCUSSIONS Analysis of the attention score distribution. To investigate how LLMs allocate attention when responding to malicious questions, we adopt Contrastive Input Erasure (CIE) (Yin & Neubig, 2022). This method quantifies how individual input tokens influence the models preference between an expected token and an unexpected one. Given that LLMs typically begin refusal responses with Sorry and acceptance responses with Sure, we define Sure as the expected token and Sorry as the unexpected token in our analysis. We visualize an example in Figure 8, where tokens highlighted in blue contribute to refusal of the malicious question, while those in red facilitate an acceptance. When presented with the original malicious question, the model exhibits focused attention peak on the phrase how to hack, which plays pivotal role in triggering refusal responses. Conversely, under our imperceptible jailbreak prompts, the models attention shifts toward the appended invisible suffixes, while the original malicious question receives uniformly low attention. This redistribution of focus away from harmful content and toward invisible tokens helps steer the model toward generating unsafe outputs, effectively bypassing alignment constraints. Analysis of the embedding differences. We discuss the embedding differences between original malicious questions and the corresponding jailbreak prompts of our imperceptible jailbreaks in LLMs. Specifically, we use the embedding layer of each aligned LLM to extract their embedding features and visualize their differences using t-SNE (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008). The results are shown in Figure 9. The visualization highlights clear separation in embeddings between original malicious questions and the jailbreak prompts of our imperceptible jailbreaks in LLMs. This embedding-level divergence underscores the effectiveness of our approach. Despite being imperceptible to humans, the invisible variation selectors successfully alter the models internal embedding features, allowing the prompts to evade safety alignment with high probability."

For each model, we measure ASRs as the percentage of instances in which the model executes the attacker-injected task rather than the original user-intended task, indicating successful prompt injection.

We extend our imperceptible jailbreak approach to the prompt injection tasks. To assess its effectiveness, we evaluate on the Open Prompt Injection dataset (Liu et al., 2024) and randomly sample 50 samples. Each example combines target task from benign user with an injected task from an attacker. The objective of the prompt injection is to make the model ignore the users task and instead perform the attackers task. In our setup, sentiment analysis is used as the target task and spam detection is used as the injected task. For implementation, the length of the adversarial suffix is set to = 400 variation selectors for all LLMs and the targetstart token is set to Spam to trigger the injected task. The round number of the chain of search is = 1. Unless otherwise specified, other hyper-parameters remain consistent with those used in the jailbreak experiments. For the evaluation metric, an attack is deemed successful if the model executes the attacker-injected task instead of the original user-intended target task, indicating that it has been successfully misled by the injection, as suggested in Liu et al. (2024). Table 4 shows the ASRs of our methods compared to other baselines. Concretely, it can be observed that our method achieves 100% ASR in prompt injection, successfully coercing the LLM to perform the attacker-injected task instead of the intended user task. Remarkably, success is achieved even in the first round when using only randomly initialized suffixes to perform the chain of search. Moreover, the attack is effective with single target-start token (Spam) and one inference without restarts. These findings demonstrate that our imperceptible attack strategy can effectively generalize from jailbreak to prompt injection scenarios. Consequently, our approach highlights new class of adversarial threats utilizing invisible characters, with implications for wide range of security scenarios. The generation examples on both jailbreak and prompt injection tasks are in Appendix C."

            "title": "5 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "In this paper, unlike existing jailbreaks that rely on visibly altering malicious questions, we propose imperceptible jailbreaks, novel class of attacks that leverage invisible variation selectors to craft adversarial suffixes appended to malicious questions without introducing any visible changes. To optimize these invisible suffixes, we introduce chain-of-search pipeline that iteratively reuses successful suffixes and target-start tokens to conduct random search in multiple rounds. This bootstrapped approach enables effective transfer of adversarial components across diverse malicious questions, improving the effectiveness of our imperceptible jailbreaks. Our extensive experiments on four aligned LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves high attack success rates, with the resultant jailbreak prompts remaining visually identical to their original forms when rendered on screen. Our imperceptible jailbreaks reveal critical vulnerability from invisible variation characters in current LLM alignment mechanisms."

            "content": "Our study demonstrates how invisible variation selectors can be exploited to bypass safety mechanisms in aligned LLMs. While these findings reveal an overlooked adversarial vector with potential for misuse, the primary objective of this work is to raise awareness of the limitations of current alignment. All experiments were conducted in controlled laboratory settings. We do not endorse or support the deployment of these attacks in real-world applications. No human subjects or private data were involved in this research, and all evaluations were performed using publicly available models and benchmarks. We recognize the risks inherent in disclosing such vulnerabilities, but we believe that transparency is essential to foster responsible research and to promote the secure deployment of LLMs."
