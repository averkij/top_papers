            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Graphical user interface (GUI) agent (Wang et al., 2024b) is an agent system that can perceive, reason, and act within GUIs in response to natural language instructions. By translating high-level user intents into concrete UI operations, GUI agents potentially represent revolution in digital interaction, transforming human-computer interaction from the manual navigation of complex interfaces to goal-oriented natural language control. Motivated by this vision, the communitys increasing efforts have accelerated progress on GUI agents, advancing UI perception, visual grounding, and GUI navigation (Wang et al., 2025a; Ye et al., 2025; Gu et al., 2025c). Despite rapid technological advances, todays GUI agents remain insufficient for reliable, robust, and secure deployment in practice. We highlight several open challenges to close this gap. (1) Agent-user interaction: Existing systems are typically optimized for end-to-end execution, however, user instructions in real-world settings are often ambiguous or incomplete. To ensure alignment with user intent, the agent must proactively ask clarifying questions, collect missing details, and seek consent for sensitive operations. Effective agentuser interaction is therefore critical yet often neglected capability. (2) Beyond UI-only action: Relying solely on UI manipulation poses two issues: (i) the long, multi-step sequences of UI operations increase brittleness to per-step errors and amplify error propagation; and (ii) it limits the agent to tasks that are UI-reachable. Integrating external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides structured shortcuts that compress long, fragile UI operation sequences into few API calls and unlock tasks previously infeasible on mobile. For example, via MCP tools, mobile agent can manipulate GitHub repositories, bringing traditionally desktop-only workflows to mobile. (3) Native devicecloud collaboration capability: Current GUI agents are typically categorized into lightweight, on-device variants or large models that can only be used as cloud services. However, cloudonly solutions introduce privacy risks, higher costs, and dependence on network connectivity, whereas on-deviceonly approaches are constrained by model capacity and capability. Consequently, foundation GUI agents lack native devicecloud collaboration capability for privacy-aware and cost-efficient routing and seamless handoff. (4) Robustness to dynamic environments: Agents trained on static, pre-collected trajectories often overfit to specific interface patterns and struggle in out-of-domain scenarios. In practice, real-world GUIs are highly dynamic: layouts vary across app versions and devices, and pop-ups or permission dialogs can appear unexpectedly. Without exposure to dynamic environments in training, agents generalize poorly and remain brittle to real-world unpredictability. To enhance GUI agent capabilities and address these challenges for realistic deployment, we introduce MAI-UI, foundational GUI agent for general GUI grounding and mobile navigation. Agent-user interaction and MCP augmentation. To equip GUI agents with user interaction and MCP tool use capability, we introduce self-evolving data pipeline that incorporates training data for general navigation as well as these two capabilities. The data pipeline iteratively updates both the model and the training corpus using three sources of data: rejection-sampled trajectories, manually-annotated trajectories, and automatic agent rollouts. The action space is also extended to allow the agent to choose among UI manipulation, user engagement, and MCP tool use. Devicecloud collaboration system. For realistic deployment, MAI-UI introduces pioneering native device-cloud collaborative system, which can dynamically select on-device or cloud execution based on task execution state and data sensitivity. The system consists of local GUI agent that both act as GUI agent and as trajectory monitor, high-capacity cloud GUI agent, and local unified trajectory memory that maintains consistent information exchange between local and cloud agents. Reinforcement learning in dynamic environments. MAI-UI incorporates online reinforcement learning as core training component, enabling improvement through interaction with dynamic environments. Our system-level optimizations scale to 500+ GUI environments for parallel rollouts. We further support asynchronous rollout and hybrid parallelism for training, enabling training on long-horizon GUI tasks with up to 50 interactive steps. This training stage yields improved GUI 2 navigation accuracy and stronger robustness to real-world unpredictability. MAI-UI includes full-spectrum of sizes to meet real-world deployment constraints, ranging from efficient 2B on device variants to mid size 8B and 32B models, and large scale 235B-A22B models. Across sizes, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance against strong baselines at comparable scales. Notably, our 2B on-device model achieves relative improvement of 75.4% over Ferret-UI Lite (Yang et al., 2025b), our mid size 8B and 32B models surpasses GUI-Owl(Ye et al., 2025), Step-GUI (Yan et al., 2025), and UI-Venus(Gu et al., 2025c), and our 235B-A22B variants outperform UI-Tars-2 (Wang et al., 2025a), Seed1.8 (Seed, 2025a), and Gemini-2.5-Pro (DeepMind, 2025a) on AndroidWorld. MAI-UI sets new state of the art across diverse evaluation settings, including GUI grounding, offline and online mobile GUI navigation, and realistic-oriented benchmark that incorporates MCP tool use and agent-user interaction, consistently outperforming prior works. Grounding. Our model establishes new state of the art performance across five well known grounding benchmarks. Notably, MAI-UI achieves 67.9% on ScreenSpot-Pro (73.5% with zoom-in), 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G (75.0% on OSWorld-G-Refine), 47.1% on UI-Vision (49.2% with zoom-in), and 96.5% on ScreenSpot-V2, substantially surpassing the strongest counterparts. Offline GUI navigation. On Android Control, MAI-UI attains strong exact match accuracy. On GUI Odyssey, it achieves success rate of 83.4%, outperforming prior methods. Online GUI navigation. In challenging dynamic real-time environments, MAI-UI-235B-A22B achieves new state of the art success rate of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2 (Wang et al., 2025a), Gemini-2.5-Pro (DeepMind, 2025a), and Seed1.8 (Seed, 2025a). Additionally, MAI-UI-32B, MAI-UI-8B, and MAI-UI-2B attain success rate of 73.3%, 70.7%, and 49.1% on AndroidWorld, respectively, all outperforming competitive models at comparable scales. Realistic-oriented evaluation. To bridge the gap for more challenging and realistic online assessment, we adopt our MobileWorld benchmark (Kong et al., 2025), which comprises evaluations beyond pure GUI operations. MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, surpassing end-to-end GUI model baselines by +20.8 and competitive with agentic frameworks with GPT-5 or Gemini-3-Pro as planners. Furthermore, on tasks that require agent-user interaction and MCP tool use, MAI-UI gains success rate of 37.5% and 51.1%, respectively, representing an absolute increase of +32.1 and +18.7."

GUI grounding aims to localize the UI element corresponding to natural language instruction on graphical interface (Wang et al., 2024c). Formally, given GUI screenshot and natural language instruction I, the GUI agent model predicts coordinate point = (x, y) that indicates the location of the target UI element. Navigation Task. Mobile navigation task can be formulated as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) (S, O, A, ) (Qin et al., 2025b), where: denotes the state space capturing the 3 Figure 2: Example trajectory of MAI-UI.

It supports effective agentuser interaction for clarification and integrates MCP-based tool augmentation for API use, and features native devicecloud collaboration system for practical deployment. MAI-UI offers broad range of model sizes, each specifically trained to deliver robust grounding and navigation capabilities. Action Space. MAI-UI provides comprehensive action space for mobile GUI control, including click, swipe, type, wait, etc. By leveraging these actions, MAI-UI can interact with the mobile device through its graphical user interface to complete wide range of tasks. We also include an answer action to directly respond to user queries in question-answering scenarios. To better support real-world scenarios, we integrate two specialized actions that extend the agent beyond pure GUI operation through active user interaction and MCP tool use. The ask_user action allows the agent to request clarification when the instruction is vague or underspecified. The mcp_call action enables the agent to leverage external MCP tools rather than relying solely on GUI operations. The full action space is shown in Table 1. Model Architecture. We employ Qwen3-VL (Bai et al., 2025a) as the backbone model. The MAI-UI family spans full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants, enabling the deployment tailored to hardware constraints and performance requirements.

            "content": "As shown in Figure 3, in addition to open-source datasets, our pipeline collects screenshots from real GUI environments to build robust GUI Agent. This process results in multi-task perception data and multi-perspective grounding data. Data Collection. To gather diverse GUI data from real-world scenarios, we not only use open-source datasets such as JEDI (Xie et al., 2025a) and OS-Altas (Wu et al., 2024), we also virtualize operating systems in containerized environments. We employed an MLLM-guided exploration strategy to navigate these environments. In every step, we ask MLLMs to identify valid actions from the current state. This procedure continuously changes the interface state and produces new screenshots. Finally, we use the a11y tree or OmniParser V2 (Lu et al., 2024b) to localize UI elements precisely. Perception Data Generation. To facilitate the diversity in the training data, for each screenshot, we randomly select one to three UI elements as inputs and prompt MLLMs to generate variety of tasks based on these elements, including question answering, captioning, and state prediction. These diverse tasks allow the model to develop comprehensive understanding of the interface, specifically enhancing its capabilities in semantic understanding, relation understanding, and layout understanding. Grounding Data Generation. As demonstrated in our prior work in UI-Ins (Chen et al., 2025), instruction diversity and correctness are critical for GUI grounding but are often neglected: Instruction quality: Approximately 23.3% of instructions in open-source grounding datasets exhibit quality issues, which can actively harm model performance during training. Instruction diversity: Performance improves significantly when training on diverse instruction perspectives, and improves further when the model learns to select appropriate instruction perspective in different scenarios. Following our Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm introduced in UI-Ins (Chen et al., 2025), we ask MLLMs to create instructions from four different human-like perspectives, including appearance, function, location and intent. This design is motivated by human UI grounding behavior: people strategically 5 Figure 3: Overview of grounding and perception data pipeline switch among instruction perspectives, selecting the most informative one for the task to support effective reasoning. We use these instructions both as inputs and as explicit reasoning pathways, thereby injecting structured reasoning into the model. This training method is introduced in the section below."

            "content": "Algorithm. To build foundation model with strong grounding capability, we follow our Instructionas-Reasoning paradigm in UI-Ins (Chen et al., 2025). Using the grounding data described above, we first perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill instruction-as-reasoning capability: utilizing diverse instruction perspectives as explicit analytical reasoning before predicting the coordinates. To encourage dynamic, context-aware selection of the appropriate reasoning perspective across different scenarios, we then conduct reinforcement learning (RL) stage using the GRPO algorithm. Reward. For GUI grounding, we use combination of format reward and point-in-box reward. In our experiments, dense reward formulations yield similar performance, so we adopt this simple and effective scheme. Format Reward. We use format reward verify that the models response is in valid format. Specifically, the thinking content and the final answer must be contained in their correct tags, and the coordinates must be extractable for the point-in-box evaluation. Point-in-Box Reward. We utilize direct point-in-box reward to measure correctness during training. prediction is considered correct if the predicted coordinate point = (xp, yp) falls within the ground-truth bounding box = (xl, yl, xr, yr), where the (xl, yl) denotes the top-left corner and (xr, yr) represents the bottom-right corner. Racc = 1 if xl xp xr and yl yp yr, 0 otherwise. (1) Zoom-In Strategy. During inference, we introduce an optional zoom-in strategy for complex and high-resolution GUI scenarios. In the first pass, the model predicts coarse coordinate. We then crop window centered on this point, with width and height equal to half of the original image dimensions, and resize the crop back to the original resolution. In the second pass, the model refines the prediction by outputting the precise coordinate on the zoomed region. 6 Figure 4: Overview of the self-evolving data pipeline for trajectory synthesis.

In the first stage, we build self-evolving data pipeline to collect and synthesize diverse multi-step trajectories, and train the model with these trajectories to obtain strong navigation capability. In the second stage, we enhance the models generalization to real-world scenarios through online reinforcement learning in dynamic environments.

            "title": "2.3.1 Supervised Fine-Tuning",
            "content": "MAI-UI employs self-evolving SFT data pipeline (overview in Figure 4), comprising three key components: Navigation Task Generation, Trajectory Synthesis, and Iterative Rejection Sampling. In the Navigation Task Generation stage, we leverage multiple sources (APP manuals, expert-designed tasks, and open-source data) to construct high-quality seed tasks. In the Trajectory Synthesis stage, we first expand the seed tasks, then combine model-based synthesis and human annotation to generate diverse trajectories. The generated trajectories undergo two quality control steps: fine-grained correctness judgment via automated evaluation and annotation quality checks by human reviewers. This ensures both diversity and quality of the synthesized trajectories. In the final stage, Iterative Rejection Sampling, we initialize training with set of Stage 2 trajectories as cold-start data to obtain an initial SFT model. We then alternate between fine-tuning the model and deploying the updated policy to rollout new trajectories. Newly generated trajectories are filtered via rejection sampling, retaining only high-quality examples aligned with the models evolving capabilities. In parallel, we continually inject new trajectories from Stage 2 to broaden coverage and raise the performance ceiling. This closed loop of training and data synthesis makes both the model and the training corpus self-evolving. Navigation Task Generation. In this stage, navigation task instructions are derived from three distinct sources: (1) application manuals, from which common usage scenarios are parsed and distilled into intentlevel task descriptions; (2) expert-designed tasks, where human annotators formulate realistic and diverse mobile navigation goals aligned with commonly used scenarios; and (3) open-source datasets, which are filtered by task complexity and reachability. This multi-source strategy expands both task diversity and scale, while rigorous source selection and filtering ensures data quality. 7 Trajectory Synthesis. In the second stage, we first expand the set of tasks to increase diversity, and then generate trajectory data through parallel pipelines that leverage both model-based rollouts and human annotation. Seed task expansion. Starting from seed tasks, we prompt multimodal large language model (MLLM) to generate variety of novel tasks. We categorize this diversity into two levels: L1 adjusts critical parameters of the original task goal, and typical parameters include date/time ranges, numeric thresholds, sorting/filter criteria, etc; L2 replaces the core objects involved in the task while remaining constrained to the same scenario and set of applications. Model synthesis and human annotation. Given the expanded set of tasks, we generate execution trajectories via two parallel pipelines: (1) human annotation: annotators manually perform tasks on an Android emulator and record both screenshots and ground-truth action sequences at each step. (2) model-based synthesis: since human annotation is time-consuming and costly, we also adopt multiple GUI agents to automatically produce valid action sequences for navigation tasks. Notably, for given task goal, multiple valid execution paths often exist. By combining these complementary sources, we significantly broaden trajectory coverage and enhance dataset robustness. Fine-grained correctness judgment and annotation quality validation. After generating diverse trajectories from both model synthesis and human annotation, we perform quality assessment through two independent validation pipelines: 1. Manual quality check: All human-annotated trajectories are reviewed by second annotator who verifies alignment between the action sequence, screenshots, and the original task goal. Inconsistent or ambiguous demonstrations are either corrected or discarded. 2. Fine-grained correctness judgment. Trajectories produced by GUI agents rollouts are examined by an MLLM-as-a-judge module (Gu et al., 2025a). The judge analyzes the task instruction, action history, and screenshots to assess correctness at both trajectory and step levels. Because some expanded tasks are infeasible and rollout models can struggle in complex tasks, many generated trajectories fail to fully complete the intended goal. However, failed trajectories often contain substantial prefix of correct actions, with errors typically occurring only at intermediate or later steps. Recognizing that not all steps in failed trajectory are erroneous, we adopt fine-grained judging approach to identify and retain useful sub-trajectories. The evaluation comprises two components: (1) Overall Trajectory Judgment: The MLLM-as-a-judge assesses end-to-end success, prioritizing visual evidence from screenshots over textual claims generated by the GUI agent; (2) Erroneous Trajectory Reuse: For failed trajectories, the judge identifies the longest prefix of correct actions before the first deviation. This enables reuse of failed trajectories, reducing data waste and enabling the model to learn from partial successes. Iterative Rejection Sampling. We adopt an iterative self-improvement loop that progressively refines both the model and the trajectory data distribution. Let M(t) denote our model after the t-th round of fine-tuning, and let Iexpansion be the set of diverse task instructions from Diverse Task Expansion. In round + 1, we use M(t) as the rollout policy to generate new trajectories on Iexpansion: RS = (cid:8)Rollout(M(t), i) Iexpansion D(t+1) where each rollout is filtered through the fine-grained correctness judgment module to retain only highquality or partially correct segments. The training set for the next iteration is then constructed by mixing the newly generated rejection sampling data with novel trajectories synthesized from the Trajectory Synthesis stage: (cid:9), (2) (3) where Dsynthesis denotes the trajectories generated from the human annotation and the agent rollouts. The model M(t+1) is then fine-tuned on D(t+1), completing the iteration. Rejection-sampled data helps close the gap between pass@1 and pass@N, while novel trajectories introduced in each iteration continually RS Dsynthesis, D(t+1) = D(t+1) 8 Figure 5: Overview of the agentic reinforcement learning framework. The framework alternates between rollout phases where the latest policy interacts with online mobile environments to generate trajectories and training phases that progressively improve the policy using trajectory-level rewards. raise the pass@N performance ceiling. This process encourages the data distribution to gradually align with the models evolving capabilities."

These trajectories are mixed into SFT, enabling the model to learn when to elicit missing information from the user and when to use MCP tools to complete tasks efficiently. Agentuser interaction. We construct tasks with deliberately omitted critical information. When the annotation/rollout reaches to step that requires missing information, it issues an ask_user action. The query is then routed to synthetic user agent implemented with standard LLM that is conditioned on hidden context containing the missing information. The user agent returns concise, context-appropriate replies, including clarifications, corrections, or refusals when applicable. We log the queryresponse pairs in the history and continue the annotation/rollout so the trajectory can incorporate the returned information to complete the task. We generate both single-turn and multi-turn interactions. MCP augmentation. We design tasks that require or benefit from external MCP tools (e.g., Amap, Github, Stockstart). During trajectory annotation or rollout, the annotator/agent can issue mcp_call with tool name and arguments. The MCP server executes the call and returns structured outputs. We record tool schemas, arguments, results, and the subsequent UI actions, and we keep trajectories that demonstrate correct MCP tool selection."

            "title": "2.3.3 Online Reinforcement Learning",
            "content": "To enhance the models reliability in long-horizon tasks and dynamic real-world environments, we employ an agentic reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with an online GUI environment, as illustrated in Figure 5. This framework operates through two alternating phases that drive iterative improvement: (1) during the rollout phase, the model executes multi-turn interactions with the GUI environment to complete tasks and collect full execution trajectories; (2) in the training phase, the model performs end-to-end policy updates using trajectory-level rewards. Through this iterative process, each improved policy generates higher-quality rollouts for subsequent training, progressively strengthening the models robustness and generalization capability. 9 Figure 6: Detailed rollout process within the MobileAgentLoop. The agent loop asynchronously calls inference servers to generate actions and executes them in stateful environments across multiple turns, with hybrid verifiers evaluating complete trajectories to produce final rewards. Scalable GUI Environment. critical bottleneck in scaling agentic RL lies in efficiently scaling stateful environments. Unlike stateless environments for mathematical reasoning or code generation, GUI environments are inherently stateful and resource-intensive, requiring each rollout to operate within an isolated instance. This constraint motivates our use of virtualized environments rather than physical devices. Inspired by an experimental feature in AndroidWorld (Rawles et al., 2024a), we built containerized solution that encapsulates the entire GUI environment within Docker image, comprising rooted Android Virtual Device (AVD), self-hosted backend services, and dedicated REST API server for orchestration. This solution is carefully designed to ensure the following three features: Consistency. The unified containerization eliminates external dependencies and guarantees behavioral consistency across heterogeneous host systems. Generalizability. To build general environment for mobile use, we integrated over 35 applications, encompassing system utilities and open-source software such as Mattermost (enterprise communication), Mastodon (social media), and Mall4Uni (e-commerce). Self-hosting these applications provides full backend access, enabling precise manipulation of initial task states and deterministic verification of execution outcomes. RL-native Design. We employ an AVD snapshot mechanism for reproducible task initialization and expose standard RL primitives (reset, step, get_observation, evaluate, and close) through the containerized API server, enabling parallel deployment of emulator instances. To further scale environments across distributed infrastructure, we introduce centralized Environment Manager that coordinates container instances across multiple physical machines. This architecture serves three critical functions: (1) efficient resource utilization: through automatic container reuse, environments are reset and reassigned upon rollout completion instead of being destroyed, (2) cross-machine orchestration: the Manager exposes unified REST API that provides transparent access to distributed resources across heterogeneous hosts, and (3) fault tolerance: we introduce automatic detection and recovery mechanisms to handle container failures, with failover protocols that seamlessly replace compromised instances from standby pool. By coordinating just 10 standard Alibaba Cloud ECS servers (ecs.ebmg5s.24xlarge), the Manager supports up to 512 concurrent environment instances for parallel rollout execution, while maintaining high availability essential for continuous online RL training. Long-Horizon RL. Training RL agents for long-horizon tasks faces two interconnected challenges: traditional synchronous rollout pipelines become inefficient bottlenecks due to extensive multi-turn environment interactions, and the resulting ultra-long trajectory (up to millions of tokens per trajectory) exceed single-GPU memory capacity, necessitating advanced parallelism strategies to enable end-to-end policy training. To address these challenges, we employ strict on-policy, asynchronous RL training framework built on top of verl (Sheng et al., 2024), illustrated in Figure 6, with two key optimizations: Asynchronous Rollout for Multi-Turn Efficiency. We implement custom agent loop that asynchronously dispatches requests to group of inference servers hosting the latest policy model, thereby mitigating GPU idling during environment interactions. The agent loop further incorporates asynchronous environment interaction with session management, maintaining backup sessions for seamless failover and replacement. On the server side, we employ load balancing and prefill caching to accelerate generation efficiency in multi-turn settings. Hybrid Parallelism for Ultra-Long Sequences. To support end-to-end training of trajectories with millions of tokens, we leverage Megatrons hybrid multi-dimensional parallelism (TP+PP+CP) to shard each long rollout trajectory across GPUs along the tensor, pipeline, and context dimensions, enabling scalable training while keeping per-GPU memory bounded. Additionally, we resize images to half their original resolution, which significantly improves training efficiency without compromising model performance. Task and Verifier Design. Effective RL training requires well-structured task distribution that balances exploration and exploitation. We manually curate diverse set of over 35 applications spanning simple single-app operations to complex multi-app workflows. Tasks are dynamically stratified into four difficulty levels based on the current policys pass@K success rate (SR): frontier tasks (025% SR) push model capability boundaries, exploration tasks (2550% SR) drive skill development, near-mastery tasks (5075% SR) approach proficiency, and exploitation tasks (75100% SR) reinforce learned behaviors. Building on this stratification, we implement an automatic curriculum that progressively adjusts task sampling throughout training. Early stages emphasize simpler tasks to establish foundational skills, while the distribution gradually shifts toward challenging tasks as success rates improve. This adaptive strategy prevents training collapse from excessive difficulty while ensuring continuous learning signals, effectively addressing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To enable scalable evaluation, we develop hybrid verification approach tailored to task characteristics. Deterministic tasks with clear success criteria use rule-based verifiers with root-level AVD access for precise state verification. For complex tasks where rule-based verification is labor-intensive, we employ an MLLM-as-a-Judge framework to evaluate execution trajectories against task objectives. This hybrid approach achieves 83% agreement with human annotations, enabling reliable large-scale verification without manual bottlenecks. Training Algorithm. we adopt tailored GRPO to sample group of outputs {oi}G and optimizes the policy via the following objective: i=1 for each task q, JGRPO(θ) = (q)D,{oi}G i=1πθold (q) (cid:34) 1 c=1 oc i=1 oi t=1 (cid:16) min ri,t(θ) ˆAi,t, clip (cid:16) ri,t(θ), 1 εlow, 1 + εhigh (cid:35) (cid:17) (cid:17) ˆAi,t where ri,t(θ) = πθ (oi,tq,oi,<t) (oi,tq,oi,<t) πθold is the importance sampling ratio, and ˆAi,t = Rimean({Ri}G std({Ri}G i= i=1) ) is the normalized advantage. We find group size of 16 strikes good balance between effectiveness and efficiency. We additionally incorporate the following features to encourage exploration and improved stability: Reward Design. The reward signal comprises two components: task completion reward and an action-level repetition penalty. Task completion is measured as binary indicator of successful execution, determined by either rule-based verifier or the MLLM-as-a-Judge framework described above. To discourage unproductive looping, we penalize recurring action sequences (from single repeated actions to cyclic patterns of 3-5 actions). Actions with identical types but different parameters are not penalized, enabling flexible execution while preventing non-progressive behavioral loops. Clip Higher. Following DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), we employ the token-level loss with no KL divergence 11 Figure 7: Overview of device-cloud collaboration architecture. The system adaptively routes computation between device and cloud models based on task context and data sensitivity. and an asymmetric clipping strategy with larger upper bound to encourage exploration. Specifically, we set εlow to 0.2 and εhigh to 0.3. Experience Replay. We maintain replay buffer of successful trajectories collected during training. When rollout group contains no successful completions, we augment it with randomly sampled trajectories from the buffer. The buffer is continuously updated with newly successful experiences, retaining only the most recent eight trajectories per task to maintain near on-policy learning. This mechanism ensures continuous learning signals even during challenging exploration phases, stabilizing training and accelerating convergence."

However, neither mode alone fully meets the requirements of real-world deployment. On-device solutions are constrained by model size and thus exhibit limited GUI agent capability.

To address these limitations, we introduce native device-cloud collaborative architecture that adaptively routes computation between device and cloud based on task context and data sensitivity."

The system consists of Local GUI Agent, which exhibit the ability of both GUI agent and trajectory monitor, Cloud GUI Agent, and Local Unified Trajectory Memory that maintains consistent information exchange between local and cloud agents. The specific function of these modules are demonstrated below: Local Agent. The Local Agent runs on device and functions as both GUI agent and monitor. As GUI agent, it perceives the current screen, and generates actions for each step of the task. As monitor, it evaluates whether the trajectory so far remains aligned with the user instruction. The monitor checks indicators such as action execution failure, repeated actions without progress, incorrect inputs, or general task deviations. If the trajectory deviates from user instruction and the current context does not contain privacy-sensitive data, the monitor triggers switch to the Cloud Agent. Additionally, the monitor generates an error summary each time deviation is detected, which we find highly effective for trajectory recovery. Cloud Agent. The Cloud Agent is called only when the monitor detects trajectory deviation. In addition to the standard GUI agent inputs, it receives an error summary from the monitor that explains why the switch was triggered. Given the trajectory history and error summary, the Cloud Agent 12 executes subsequent steps, leveraging its higher capacity to complete the task. Local Unified Trajectory Memory. On device, we maintain unified history that records the task instruction, historical screenshots, and the models past outputs, including thoughts and actions. During action execution, the memory module projects the unified history into the action spaces expected by the device and cloud models, enabling either model can resume from any state without ambiguity. Execution loop. The user provides task instruction to the Local Agent. At each step, the Local Agent observes the current screenshot, decides an action, and executes it. The environmental observations and model outputs are then written to the Local Unified Trajectory Memory. Every few steps, the local agent assesses alignment between user instruction and the trajectory so far. If alignment is met, the loop continues on device. If deviation is detected and no sensitive data is involved, the system calls the Cloud Agent for task completion."

Compared with prior work (Jiang & Huang, 2025), our Local Agent introduces two key innovations required for practical device-side deployment: Integrated monitoring capability. In practice, the monitor must handle varied and complex cases, and prompt engineering alone is unlikely to deliver reliable monitoring. The on-device model is explicitly trained to judge whether the trajectory so far remains aligned with the user instruction across diverse apps, layouts, and tasks. Error feedback generation. When deviation is detected, our model further generates concise error summary to guide trajectory recovery. This signal is crucial for the Cloud Agent to complete the task correctly, since handoffs occur only after the trajectory has already deviated from the user instruction. Training procedure. We train the Local Agent jointly on two data sources: (i) standard GUI agent data covering perception, grounding, and navigation, and (ii) monitor data that include alignment reasoning, alignment decision, and error summaries. This multi-task training recipe teaches the on-device model to execute and monitor simultaneously, without requiring separate models or fragile prompt engineering."

Many evaluations rely on simple applications or limited app categories, and they typically assume idealized interaction models where user instructions are perfectly clear and agents operate solely through GUI manipulation (Rawles et al., 2024b; Xu et al., 2025a). This gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility has become increasingly apparent. To evaluate MAI-UIs practical capabilities, we adopt our MOBILEWORLD (Kong et al., 2025) benchmark, comprehensive benchmark designed to bridge this evaluation gap. MOBILEWORLD features over 200 realistic tasks spanning 15+ opensource applications across critical domains including e-commerce (Mall4Uni, mirroring Temu/Amazon), enterprise communication (Mattermost, mirroring Microsoft Teams/Slack), social media (Mastodon, mirroring X/Twitter), and daily productivity tools. In addition, MOBILEWORLD extends beyond standard GUI manipulation to evaluate two essential real-world capabilities, which directly align with MAI-UIs design of practical deployment. Agent-User Interaction, where agents must detect ambiguous user requests and proactively seek clarification rather than making incorrect assumptions. MCP Tool Integration, where agents must intelligently decide between manual GUI navigation and API-based operations via MCP (Anthropic, 2024) to optimize efficiency. 13 Table 2: Performance comparison on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark.

On ScreenSpot-Pro (Li et al., 2025), MAI-UI-32B attains 67.9% accuracy, an 4.1% absolute accuracy gain over the strongest baseline GTA1-32B. With the adaptive zoom-in strategy, performance further increases to 73.5%, surpassing Gemini 3 Pro (DeepMind, 2025b) and Seed1.8 (Seed, 2025a). On OSWorld-G (Xie et al., 2025b), our models show consistent improvements over the best comparable baselines. Specifically, MAI-UI-32B with zoom-in achieves 70.9% on OSWorld-G and 75.0% on OSWorld-G Refine. On UI-Vision (Nayak et al., 2025), MAI-UI-32B achieves 47.1% accuracy, and it increases to 49.2% with the zoom-in strategy, making an absolute gain of +12.4 points over the previous best UI-Venus-Ground-72B. On MMBench-GUI L2 (Xuehui Wang et al., 2025), MAI-UI reaches 91.3%, surpassing the prior best GTA1 by +7.9 points. On ScreenSpot-V2 (Wu et al., 2024), MAI-UI sets new SOTA at 96.5%. It is also worth noting that MAI-UI-2B, despite its small size, demonstrates strong grounding performance. For example, it achieves 62.8% on ScreenSpot-Pro with the zoom-in operation. This score outperforms GUI-Owl-32B and UI-Venus-72B. We present grounding case studies across different operating systems in Figure 15. Detailed per-benchmark results are discussed below. Grounding for high-resolution scenario. ScreenSpot-Pro evaluates grounding performance on highresolution professional software with dense and fine-grained UI layouts. As illustrated in Table 2, MAI-UI achieves the best grounding performance across all categories, including CAD, development, creative, scientific, office, and operation systems. Averaged over categories, the MAI-UIs 2B, 8B, and 32B variants achieve 57.4%, 65.8%, and 67.9%, surpassing the best baselines of comparable size by +4.1, +10.9, and +4.3 points, respectively. With the zoom-in strategy, MAI-UI-32B further attains an average accuracy of 73.5%, significantly surpassing strong open-source baselines such as GTA1-32B (Yang et al., 2025a), UI-Venus (Gu et al., 2025c), and GUI-Owl (Ye et al., 2025), and even outperforming Gemini 3 Pro (DeepMind, 2025b) and Seed1.8 (Seed, 2025a).

To assess grounding performance in terms of instruction diversity and complexity, we use UI-Vision and MMBench-GUI L2 for evaluation. UI-Vision provides multi-perspective queries (e.g., spatial, functional), and MMBench-GUI L2 includes instructions of Basic (low-level, attribute/appearance) and Advanced (high-level, goal-oriented) categories. Together, these benchmarks reflect realistic usage where user instructions are heterogeneous, high-level, and often implicit. On UI-Vision, our model sets new state of the art: MAI-UI-32B with zoom-in achieves 49.2% average accuracy, exceeding the strongest baseline (UI-Venus-Ground-72B 36.8%) by +12.4 points. The 8B and 2B variants of MAI-UI also outperform baselines of similar size by +15.2 and +9.9 points, demonstrating superior grounding performance across diverse instruction perspectives. On MMBench-GUI L2, MAI-UI-32B, 8B and 2B variants attain 91.3%, 88.8%, 82.6%, setting new state-of-the-art results at each scale. Additionally, the improvement on the high-level Advanced setting is much larger than on Basic setting, demonstrating strong grounding under high-level, implicit instructions. Grounding for complex desktop scenario. OSWorld-G and OSWorld-G-Refine assess grounding in complex desktop scenarios that require software commonsense, layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation. As illustrated in Table 5 and Table 11, MAI-UI demonstrate consistent gains across categories and model sizes. On OSWorld-G, MAI-UI-32B achieves an average of 67.6%, and increases to 70.9% with zoom-in. This exceeds the strongest baselines, including UI-Venus-72B and GTA1-32B. MAI-UI-2B, and MAI-UI-8B also outperform baselines of similar scale by 5.0 and 5.4 points, respectively. Category-wise, the MAI-UI shows balanced performance, with the 32B variant achieving 78.5% in Text Matching, 75.2% in Element Recognition, 78.3% in Layout Understanding, and 62.4% in Fine-grained Manipulation. On OSWorld-G Refine, which reduces instruction ambiguity and emphasizes precise manipulation, MAI-UI-32B reaches 73.9% and further improves to 75.0% with zoom-in, exceeding strong 17 Table 6: Performance comparison on AndroidWorld Benchmark.

GUI Odyssey targets cross-application navigation in mobile environments. As shown in Table 7, MAI-UI produces competitive results on Android Control. On GUI Odyssey, MAI-UI-32B achieves new state of the art on the exact match score, substantially outperforming strong baselines and highlighting superior cross-application navigation capability of our model. Online Benchmark Online evaluation provides more realistic assessment of agent capability than static offline tests, as it requires multi-turn adaptive perception, reasoning, and action in dynamic environments. We evaluate MAI-UI on online benchmark AndroidWorld (Rawles et al., 2024a), live emulatorbased benchmark comprising 116 tasks across 20 mobile applications. For fair comparison, we report results only for end-to-end GUI agents, isolating the intrinsic GUI capability of foundation models without interference from pipeline frameworks or external tools. As shown in Table 6, MAI-UI achieves new state-of-the-art results on AndroidWorld across model scales. MAI-UI-235B-A22B attains 76.7% success rate, surpassing UI-TARS-2 (73.3%) and Gemini-2.5-Pro (69.7%) by +3.4 and +7.0 points, respectively. The 32B variant reaches 73.3%, establishing SOTA at its scale and outperforming larger baseline models, including UI-Venus-72B, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and UI-TARS-1.5. MAI-UI-8B achieves 70.7% sucess rate, exceeding strong similar-scale models such as GUI-Owl-7B and Step-GUI-8B. Finally, the 2B model attains 49.1% success rate, improving over the strongest on-device baseline Ferret-UI-Lite-3B (28.0%), by +21.1 points (+75.4% relative), providing strong foundation for our native device-cloud collaboration system. These results demonstrate the strong GUI capability of MAI-UI across the full spectrum of scales. Real-world-oriented online evaluation. Beyond AndroidWorld, we assess our models on MobileWorld (Kong et al., 2025), more challenging and more realistic online benchmark with 201 tasks across 20 applications. MobileWorld emphasizes long-horizon, cross-application tasks and includes evaluation beyond pure UI operation, such as MCP tool use and agentuser interaction. As summarized in Table 8, MAI-UI achieve substantial improvements against end-to-end models: MAI-UI-235B-A22B reaches 41.7% overall success rate, MAI-UI-32B attains 37.3%, and MAI-UI-8B scores 24.9%. These outperform the strongest end-to-end baseline (Doubao-1.5-UI-TARS, 20.9%) by +20.8, +16.4, and +4.0 points, respectively. We also compare against agentic frameworks that use strong planner such as GPT-5 and an external 19 (a) (b) Figure 8: Case studies of MCP tool using of MAI-UI.

These pipelines benefit from strong planning and reasoning ability and an external execution model, making the comparison not strictly fair. However, our pure end-to-end models remain competitive, with MAI-UI-235B-A22B reaching 41.7% overall success rate, close to Gemini-3-Pro+UI-Ins (46.3%) and Claude-4.5-Sonnet+UI-Ins (43.8%). To quantitatively assess our models MCP tool-use and agentuser interaction capabilities, we evaluate on the MobileWorld benchmarks two relevant subsets (User-Int., 45 tasks; MCP, 40 tasks). Our MAI-UI235B-A22B achieves 51.1% on User-Int. and 37.5% on MCP, outperforming existing end-to-end baselines by +18.7 and +32.1 points, respectively (best prior scores: 32.4% and 5.4%). Compared with agentic frameworks, our end-to-end model is competitive on agentuser interaction, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro+UIIns-7B (24.4%) and Claude-4.5-Sonnet+UI-Ins-7B (37.8%). Overall, these results demonstrate strong 20 Figure 9: case study of agent user interaction.

            "content": "In addition to the quantitative results, we present case studies for the MCP tool use and user-agent interaction capability of MAI-UI. MCP-Augmented Tasks Figure 8 shows two representative scenarios that benefit from MCP tool use, illustrating two core benefits: compressing multi step GUI operations into few tool calls and enabling traditionally desktop only workflows on mobile. Figure 8a illustrates realistic cross-application task that aggregates information and compares route distance. The user receives two apartment addresses by SMS and asks the agent to compare driving time from Alibaba Xixi Campus, then send the nearer address to Mia. Traditionally, this would require repeated switching between SMS and maps app, copying and pasting addresses, and running two separate route searches. With an Amap MCP call, the agent can simply sets the campus as the origin and each candidate address from the SMS as the destination, and retrieves structured travel time and distance. This process compresses multiple GUI operations into small number of tool calls, significantly reducing GUI interactions and improving end-to-end efficiency. Figure 8b shows workflow that is usually handled on desktop environments. The user asks the agent to retrieve the author and commit message from an GitHub repository, and send the summary by email. On 21 Figure 10: The native devicecloud collaboration (DCC) capability significantly improves the on-device models online performance, surpassing the random switch (RS) baseline, w/o error summary (ES) baseline, and several larger pure-cloud models by substantial margin. Our native DCC system also improves efficiency, executing 42.7% of steps locally and completing 40.5% of tasks entirely on-device, thereby reducing cloud calls. mobile, browsing commit history is inconvenient due to limited screen space. Through MCP API calls, the agent directly queries the repository and receives commit metadata in structured form, and extracts the fields required by the task. This case demonstrates that using MCP tools can not only compress UI operations but also expand the capability of mobile GUI agent, providing access to services that are commonly available in desktop applications. Agent-User-Interaction To evaluate the agents ability to interact with the user when necessary, we present case study of file-sharing task that requires proactive clarification (Figure 9). The user instructs the agent to locate recent resume files in the Downloads folder and send them to an HR colleague, but several critical parameters are under-specified, including the recipients email address and the email body. Detecting these gaps, MAI-UI pauses execution and issues an ask_user action to request the missing details. After receiving the users response, the agent resumes the GUI trajectory: it auto-fills and sends the email. This example demonstrates MAI-UIs proactive agentuser interaction capability, which is essential in realistic GUI tasks where instructions are often ambiguous or incomplete. Overall, the combination of MCP enhancement and Agent-User Interaction enables the model to better handle real-world tasks."

Our system uses MAI-UI-2B as the local agent and MAI-UI-32B as the cloud model. We compare our DCC system with four settings: (i) Local GUI agent, which uses the on-device model solely as the GUI agent; (ii) Cloud GUI agent, which relies on large scale cloud GUI agents; and (iii) Random switch (RS) baseline, which calls the cloud model at the same frequency as our DCC method but without monitor-guided switch. As shown in the left part of Figure 10, our DCC system achieves relative improvement of 33.4% over the ondevice model, significantly strengthening its ability to complete mobile tasks. It further surpasses the RS baseline by 7.7%, demonstrating that monitor-driven cloud-model switching effectively triggers cloud assistance and boosts collaboration quality. Finally, compared with several pure cloud GUI agent baselines, our devicecloud system achieves higher scores, demonstrating strong performance under 22 Figure 11: pilot study demonstrating privacy protection in the device-cloud collaboration system. At step 3, the local agent deviates, as it repeatedly tapping the Login button without entering password. The trajectory monitor flags the misalignment and proposes switch to the cloud agent. However, the privacy detection module detects sensitive credentials and blocks the switch, keeping execution on device. The local monitor ultimately corrects the trajectory and completes the task. realistic deployment setting. Efficiency gains versus cloud-only solution. We analyze cloud usage and on-device completion under our devicecloud collaboration system in the right part of Figure 10. Compared to cloud-only serving, our system reduces cloud model calls by 42.7%, substantially lowering serving cost and latency for using cloud model. On AndroidWorld, over 40% of tasks are completed entirely on device, further confirming that unnecessary cloud model calls are reduced. These results demonstrate that our devicecloud collaboration obtains substantial efficiency gains compared to cloud-only solutions. Impact of error summary information. To assess the effectiveness of monitor-generated error summaries, we run an ablation that removes the error summary (ES) at switching and compare against our original system. As shown in the left part of Figure 10, compared to the baseline that without error summary, providing the error summary yields +6.9 increase in task success rate, underscoring its importance for the cloud agents trajectory recovery process. Privacy preservation. We present pilot case study to showcase the systems privacy protection capability. We introduce an additional local privacy monitor, which blocks cloud switch whenever privacy-sensitive content is present, even if trajectory deviation is detected. As shown in Figure 11, for 23 (a) (b) Figure 12: MAI-UI-8B-RL training details: (a) train set reward trend (b) performance scaling with the number of environments. task involving user-sensitive content (password entry), the system continues on-device execution even when the monitor detects trajectory deviation (repeated clicks on the login icon in steps 24), thereby adhering privacy constraints. The Local Agent ultimately corrects the trajectory and completes the task. Throughout this case, no privacy-sensitive content is transmitted to the cloud, demonstrating that this device-cloud collaboration system effectively protects user privacy."

            "title": "3.5 Online RL Analysis",
            "content": "Performance Gains. As shown in Table 9, online RL consistently enhances performance across all model scales. Specifically, the 2B model achieves an absolute improvement of 4.0 percentage points (45.1% 49.1%), the 8B model gains 6.0 percentage points (64.7% 70.7%), and the 32B model improves by 3.5 percentage points (69.8% 73.3%). These results correspond to relative improvements of 8.9%, 9.3%, and 5.0%, respectively, demonstrating that online RL effectively enhances agent performance regardless of model size. Figure 12a further illustrates this improvement, showing that the reward metric steadily increases throughout the training process. Experimental Analysis. We perform ablation studies to evaluate the proposed key components in online RL, with the results shown in Table 9 and Figure 12. Table 9: Online RL performance gains and ablations on standard GRPO and interaction budget per trajectory (max_env_steps) Method AndroidWorld SFT vs. RL Comparison MAI-UI-2B-SFT MAI-UI-2B-RL MAI-UI-8B-SFT MAI-UI-8B-RL MAI-UI-32B-SFT MAI-UI-32B-RL RL Ablation on 8B MAI-UI-8B-SFT GRPO (max_env_steps=50) Our method (max_env_steps=15) Our method (max_env_steps=30) Our method (max_env_steps=50) 45.1 49.1 (+4.0) 64.7 70.7 (+6.0) 69.8 73.3 (+3.5) 64.7 66.5 (+1.8) 66.4 (+1.7) 68.5 (+3.8) 70.7 (+6.0) Comprison with standard GRPO. Standard GRPO applied after SFT yields modest gain of +1.8 percentage points on AndroidWorld. In contrast, our enhanced GRPO with data curriculum, repetition penalty, and experience replay achieves +6.0 percentage point improvement, delivering an additional +4.2 percentage points over the baseline. Effect of interaction budget. The maximum environment interaction budget per trajectory substantially influences performance. Extending the budget from 15 to 30 and subsequently to 50 steps yields progressive improvements (+1.7, +3.8, and +6.0 percentage points, respectively). larger budget enables more extensive rollouts and provides richer exploration opportunities during training. Impact of image resolution. Image resolution critically affects online RL efficiency, as higher resolutions introduce more visual tokens and slow down both training and inference. Leveraging the 24 (a) (b) Figure 13: MAI-UI demonstrates robustness to unexpected permission dialogs (a) and pop-ups (b) in AndroidWorld, and reliably resumes the task. relative coordinate mechanism of Qwen3-VL, we found that 720p resolution achieves performance comparable to 1080p while providing 50.1% speedup per step. Conversely, 540p resolution, despite faster processing, substantially degrades model performance due to insufficient detail for fine-grained UI element perception. Scaling parallel environments. Figure 12b shows how parallel environment count affects model performance. Increasing parallel environments from 32 to 512 significantly accelerates learning and improves final performance (65.5% 70.7%). Training with fewer environments exhibits early saturation, indicating that limited environments constrain policy improvement. These findings highlight that scaling parallel environments to enhance exploration diversity is critical for overcoming performance bottlenecks in GUI agent RL training. Case Studies: Enhanced Robustness. Figures 13 and 14 illustrate qualitative improvements in robustness after online RL training. Figure 13 demonstrates MAI-UIs ability to handle unexpected permission dialogs and pop-ups during task execution. When creating new contact for \"Emilia Gonzalez,\" the agent encounters notification permission request that was not present during offline training. The RL-trained model successfully dismisses the dialog and continues task execution without deviation, whereas the base model often fails to recover from such interruptions. Figure 14 showcases the agents capability to recover from failed actions in complex expense management task. When instructed to delete duplicate expenses, the agent initially navigates to the wrong application. Nevertheless MAI-UI correct the trajectory and compleete the task in the following steps. These case studies highlight that online RL training substantially improves the agents robustness to real-world unpredictability. This is difficult to acquire through offline training alone, where the diversity of edge cases and failure modes is inherently limited."

            "content": "As demonstrated by our prior work in UI-Ins (Chen et al., 2025), our Instruction-as-Reasoning approach offers benefits from several perspectives: Reasoning that helps grounding. Prior studies find that general chain-of-thought reasoning can often degrade grounding performance (Lu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025a; Zhou et al., 2025). Inspired by how humans approach grounding, we train models to use diverse instruction perspectives as explicit 25 Figure 14: MAI-UI shows robustness in recovering from recovering from failures: the agent initially navigates to the wrong application, but MAI-UI correct the trajectory and complete the task. reasoning pathways, making reasoning actionable and beneficial for GUI grounding.

            "title": "4.1 GUI Grounding",
            "content": "GUI grounding is the foundational capability of GUI agents that maps natural language instructions to the locations of target elements in screenshots. Prior GUI grounding methods mainly focus on training in Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) paradigm, such as JEDI (Xie et al., 2025a), OS-Atlas (Wu et al., 2024), Aguvis (Xu et al., 2025b), Uground (Gou et al., 2025) and Aria-UI (Yang et al., 2024b). Reinforcement learning methods, particularly GRPO (Guo et al., 2025a) have demonstrated remarkable sucess on various visual-language tasks, including Semantic Segmentation (Liu et al., 2025c), Visual Question-Answering (Liu et al., 2025d; Huang et al., 2025) and Temporal Video Grounding (Wang et al., 2025c). Consequently, recent efforts have increasingly focused on adapting RL for GUI grounding. GUI Grounding methods like GUI-R1 (Luo et al., 2025), GUI-Actor (Wu et al., 2025) and GTA1 (Yang et al., 2025a) play as an pioneer role in pure RL paradigm and surpass SFT-based methods by large margin. However, key limitation of pure RL paradigm is that it overlooks the substantial benefit offered by an initial SFT stage. While InfiGUI-R1 (Liu et al., 2025a) achieved success with an SFT+RL framework by reframing GUI grounding as trajectory-level task that encourages model reflection, the SFT+RL paradigm remains difficult to implement in practice. It is also demonstrated by Phi-Ground (Zhang 26 Figure 15: Grounding case studies across different operating systems. et al., 2025a) that SFT+RL framework is prone to policy collapse. Our grounding method overcomes this issue by using the SFT stage to teach the model diverse reasoning through different instruction perspectives, and then utilizes the RL stage to further incentivize the model to select the appropriate reasoning pathway, thereby establishing an effective example for the SFT+RL training paradigm."

            "title": "4.2 GUI Navigation",
            "content": "Moving beyond single-step grounding, research on GUI agents has advanced to GUI navigation tasks, where agents must execute multi-step action sequences to complete user instruction. Early works achieve this goal through agent frameworks that contain multiple components, such as planner and grounding module (Wang et al., 2024a; Yang et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2024). For practical deployment and cost efficiency, recent efforts increasingly target unified visionlanguageaction models that jointly learn grounding and navigation (Qin et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b; Gu et al., 2025b). Most of these models are large-scale to enable stronger reasoning and planning, while growing line of work builds competitive small on-device models for lower latency, improved privacy, and resilience to connectivity constraints (Yang et al., 2025b). To meet deployment needs, we release both large-scale and on-device models, and further integrate native devicecloud collaboration capability. With the rapid development in GUI navigation, progress has also been made in real-world deployment of GUI agents (Google, 2025). In practice, however, current agents function as copilots rather than 27 standalone executors, making effective agentuser interaction critical yet often overlooked capability. Moreover, most agents remain limited to pure UI manipulation, and only recently have efforts begun to equip them with extended SDK functions (Wang et al., 2025a). Integrating external tools such as the MCP can compress long, brittle UI action sequences into handful of API calls and unlock desktop workflows that were previously infeasible on mobile."

            "content": "In this work, we present MAI-UI, family of foundation GUI agents. To address challenges for realworld deployment of GUI agents, we introduce three main components: self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, native devicecloud collaboration system that routes execution by task state and data sensitivity, and an online RL framework with advanced system optimizations. Experimental results show that MAI-UI sets new state of the art on grounding benchmarks and both online and offline evaluation of mobile use navigation. Benchmark results on MobileWorld and qualitative case studies verify effective agentuser interaction and MCPenabled tool use capability of MAI-UI. The devicecloud collaboration substantially improves on-device performance while reducing cloud model calls, yielding performance, privacy and cost benefits. Taken together, these advances make MAI-UI step further toward practical foundation GUI agent for mobile use."
