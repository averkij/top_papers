            "content": "With the rapid progress of multimodal reward models (RMs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], their potential in aligning vision generation models with human preferences has attracted growing attention. By converting subjective and high-level human judgments into learnable reward signals, RMs enable effective preference-driven post-training for vision generators. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Early reward modeling for visual generation typically Corresponding authors. uses fixed, discriminative scorers [12, 13, 14, 15] to assign scalar rewards. Later works shift to BradleyTerry [16] pairwise preference modeling to learn rewards from relative comparisons [4, 17]. More recently, VLM-asa-judge [1, 2, 3, 18] has emerged, leveraging strong generative VLMs [19, 20] to provide context-dependent evaluations for reinforcement learning. Despite their effectiveness, current RMs often follow one-size-fits-all assessment paradigm: (1) Fixed discriminative scorers (e.g., CLIP [12], PickScore [15]) and BradleyTerry preference models (e.g., VideoAlign [4], HPSv3 [17]) typically learn single global reward function that assigns scalar score to each input (or induces preferences via score differences), implicitly assuming monolithic preference distribution shared across diverse prompts and visual contents. (2) VLM-as-a-judge approaches (e.g., UnifiedReward-Think [2]) leverage generative VLMs to produce richer textual judgments, yet they often follow static evaluation rubrics with fixed checklist of criteria. As result, their reward feedback remains insensitive to content-specific visual cues, which can misguide optimization and cause systematic misalignment with human preferences. In this work, we posit that reliable reward assessment should be flexibly adapted to the prompt intent and visual content. For example, prompts with implicit narrative intent should emphasize storytelling consistency, subject relationships, and emotional tone (see Fig. 1), whereas motion-intensive videos with frequent physical contact demand explicit evaluation of action dynamics and physical plausibility (see Fig. 2). This behavior closely mirrors how humans assess visual generations: evaluators first interpret the prompt intent and the depicted content, then evaluate along small set of common, task-specific high-level dimensions. Within each dimension, they selectively attend to the aspects most relevant to the given instance. When the scene exhibits additional characteristics, evaluators naturally introduce new high-level dimensions to capture these salient factors. In other words, human evaluation is inherently content-adaptive, context-aware reasoning process, where both the evaluation criteria and their relative importance are dynamically adjusted to match the semantic intent and visual evidence. As inspired, this work proposes UnifiedReward-Flex, unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with context-adaptive reasoning to dynamically tailor evaluation criteria, which performs assessment in hierarchical manner. Specifically, given prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and extracts salient visual evidence, then composes hierarchical evaluation plan by instantiating fine-grained sub-criteria under few predefined coarse-grained dimensions. When the context demands additional considerations, it augments the hierarchy with new high-level dimensions and their corresponding sub-criteria. This dynamic criterion composition yields adaptive and informative reward feedback that aligns with the human evaluation process and remains robust across diverse prompts and visual content. Our training follows two-stage pipeline: (1) We first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs [21] to bootstrap supervised fine-tuning (SFT), endowing the model with content-aware criterion composition. (2) We then apply direct preference optimization (DPO) using preference pairs with human-grounded labels: given two sampled responses for the same input, if one reaches the correct conclusion while the other does not, the preference naturally favors the correct one; if both are correct, we further assign the preference based on the quality of their adaptive reasoning trajectories, prioritizing more flexible and context-grounded evaluation hierarchies. Empirically, this reasoning-aware preference alignment improves the reward models discriminative power, even among samples that are all correct. Extensive experiments show that UnifiedReward-Flex consistently outperforms strong reward model baselines on both image and video reward tasks, providing more robust and context-aware reward signals. To further validate its practical utility, we use it as the reward signal for pairwise preference reward-based GRPO [6] in both image and video synthesis, yielding substantial quantitative and qualitative improvements in downstream generation quality.

            "content": "Multimodal Reward Models (RMs) are crucial in aligning vision generation models with human preferences. Early reward modeling typically relies on fixed, discriminative scorers that assign scalar score to each generated sample [12, 13, 14, 15]. These scorers are lightweight and easy to deploy, but they often behave as task-agnostic heuristics: the reward function is largely fixed across prompts and contents, making it difficult to reflect diverse evaluation focuses. To better capture the relative nature of human judgment, later works shift from absolute scoring to pairwise preference modeling under the Bradley-Terry pairwise preference modeling [16]. Instead of regressing single target score, the RM is trained to assign higher reward to preferred samples within comparison pair, which often yields more stable and better calibrated training signals for preference optimization [4, 5, 17]. Nevertheless, BradleyTerry based RMs still typically learn single global scalar reward function shared across heterogeneous prompts and visual contents, implicitly assuming monolithic preference distribution. More recently, VLM-as-a-judge has emerged as flexible alternative that leverages strong generative VLMs to directly assess and compare candidates [1, 2, 3, 18, 22]. Compared to discriminative scorers, these judge models can provide richer evaluative feedback, potentially incorporating multi-aspect reasoning and content-dependent judgments. However, existing VLM-judge approaches commonly follow static evaluation rubrics or fixed checklists of criteria, which limits their ability to dynamically tailor evaluation priorities to the semantic intent and visual evidence of each input. To this end, this work proposes UnifiedReward-Flex, unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with content-aware reasoning. Unlike prior RMs that apply fixed global scoring function or static rubrics, UnifiedReward-Flex dynamically constructs context-adaptive hierarchical 3 Figure 2 Qualitative Result of UnifiedReward-Flex on Video Generation Personalized Reward Reasoning. assessment by self-instantiating fine-grained criteria based on given prompt intent and visual evidence. Reinforcement Learning for Vision Generation has evolved rapidly in recent years. Early attempts either fine-tuned models with scalar reward supervision [23, 24] or adopted reward-weighted regression to exploit reward feedback in more stable manner [3, 4, 25]. Subsequent work drew inspiration from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [26] and incorporated policy-gradient updates into diffusion-based generators, showing promising improvements in sample quality [27, 28, 29]. Despite their effectiveness, these methods are often computationally demanding and sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. To improve training efficiency, growing line of research explores preference optimization with supervised objectives, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), which directly leverages human preference data and avoids expensive on-policy rollouts [30, 31, 32, 33]. More recently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GPRO) [34] has emerged as promising objective for preference optimization in complex reasoning tasks. [9, 10] extend GRPO to flow matching models by reformulating the ODE sampling process as an equivalent SDE, enabling diverse sampling while performing preference-driven optimization. [7, 11, 35] further improve efficiency with sliding-window mechanism that localizes SDE sampling and GRPO updates within window while retaining ODE sampling elsewhere. However, these approaches typically optimize pointwise scalar rewards and may suffer from reward hacking [8, 9]. Pref-GRPO [6] reveals that reward hacking is largely driven by illusory advantages induced by unreliable reward signals, and stabilizes learning by replacing pointwise rewards with pairwise preference-based feedback. In this work, we integrate our UnifiedReward-Flex into the Pref-GRPO framework for both image and video synthesis to validate its effectiveness."

As result, their reward feedback is often insensitive to content-specific visual cues and prompt intent, leading to systematic misalignment with inherently subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with context-adaptive reasoning to dynamically tailor evaluation criteria. In this section, we first present our unified personalized reward modeling framework (Sec. 3.2), including the design of our context-adaptive reasoning process (Sec. 3.2.1) and two-stage training pipeline: (i) reasoning distillation for SFT (Sec. 3.2.2) and (ii) reasoning-aware preference alignment via DPO (Sec. 3.2.3).

            "content": "Our goal is to mimic how humans evaluate generated visual content. In practice, for given task, human evaluators typically assess outputs along small set of common high-level dimensions (e.g., semantic alignment and perceptual quality), while instantiating more fine-grained factors depending on the prompt intent and the visual evidence under each dimensions. When additional considerations become salient (e.g., Narrative & Interaction in Fig. 1), they naturally extend the evaluation dimensions to better capture what matters for the current instance. Guided by this principle, we design context-adaptive hierarchical reasoning process that starts from three predefined common dimensions as stable anchors (e.g., semantic alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics for image generation). Under each anchor, the model instantiates prompt-specific sub-dimensions for assessment, and it can further introduce new high-level dimensions (with corresponding sub-dimensions) when required by the context. For each high-level dimension, the model aggregates the evidence across its instantiated sub-dimensions to produce an overall comparative analysis and dimension-level winner; it then combines the outcomes from all high-level dimensions to determine final overall winner. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, UnifiedReward-Flex derives prompt-relevant sub-dimensions under the given anchors to jointly assess semantic adherence, visual quality under motion, and cinematographic coherence of generated videos. Since this case emphasizes rich motion and physical interactions, the model further introduces an additional high-level dimension (i.e., Action Dynamics & Physics) to explicitly evaluate temporal coherence and physical plausibility, which is then incorporated into the final overall decision. By tailoring the evaluation hierarchy to the generation context, our model provides richer reward supervision for preference optimization, improving both intent satisfaction and content-critical quality factors."

This formulation provides principled and stable way to post-train vision generators with learned reward signals. Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO (Pref-GRPO) [6] replaces absolute reward scores with relative preference judgments, which better align with the common practice of evaluating visual generations via pairwise comparisons. Instead of assigning an independent scalar reward to each sample, Pref-GRPO derives terminal rewards from comparative outcomes among group of generated samples.

For 0 𝑥 𝑗 each unordered pair (𝑥𝑖 . 0 Based on all pairwise comparisons within the group, Pref-GRPO defines relative preference reward for each sample as its normalized win rate: 0), preference model determines which sample is preferred, denoted by 𝑥𝑖 0, 𝑥 𝑗 0}𝐺 𝑖=1 𝑅(𝑥𝑖 0, 𝑐) = 1 𝐺 1 (cid:213) 𝑗𝑖 𝟙(cid:0)𝑥𝑖 0 𝑥 𝑗 0 (cid:1) , (12) which reflects how often sample 𝑖 is preferred over other candidates under the same prompt.

Fixed scorers (e.g., HPSv2 [13], PickScore [15]) and BradleyTerry preference models (e.g., HPSv3 [17], VideoReward [4]) provide single global signal that is insensitive to prompt-specific requirements. Besides, UnifiedReward-Think [2] is strong VLM-as-a-judge baseline that performs multimodal assessment with long-chain reasoning, but still follows fixed checklist of evaluation criteria. In contrast, UnifiedReward-Flex dynamically instantiates fine-grained criteria conditioned on the prompt and visual evidence, yielding more reliable pairwise decisions. Quantitatively, as shown in Tab. 1, UnifiedRewardFlex achieves the best performance across all benchmarks; notably, it improves over UnifiedReward-Think by +3.2 points on MMRB2 and +2.2 points on GenAI-Bench-Video, highlighting the benefit of context-adaptive criterion composition beyond long-chain reasoning alone. Qualitative results are provided in Figs. 1 and 2. For example, Fig. 1 highlights our hierarchical, context-adaptive evaluation in story-implied prompt (a child healing wounded kirin). Starting from common anchor dimensions (semantic alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics), our model instantiates prompt-specific sub-criteria to check core requirements such as subject completeness and style coherence. Crucially, because the prompt implicitly describes narrative moment rather than static portrait, the model further augments the evaluation hierarchy with an additional high-level dimension, i.e., Narrative & Interaction, to judge whether the generation conveys coherent healing scene with meaningful entity relations. This adaptive criterion composition prevents the evaluation from being dominated by surface-level rendering quality alone, and yields preference judgments that better reflect prompt-critical intent, providing more informative reward supervision for downstream optimization. 10 Table 4 Quantitative results on VBench.

The improvements are broad-based across challenging dimensions that require compositional and intent-aware evaluation, such as Compound and Logical Reasoning. It also generalizes well to out-of-domain benchmarks (Tab. 3): achieves the best semantic consistency on T2I-CompBench [42] and GenEval [41], while maintaining or improving image quality metrics (e.g., UnifiedReward [1]) compared to other reward baselines. These results indicate that optimizing with our personalized reward does not merely overfit to in-domain prompts; instead, it promotes more robust alignment with diverse prompt intents and visual evidence. Qualitatively, Fig. 3 further shows that our model better enforces prompt-critical constraints. In the Newton example (row 2), the prompt couples multiple requirements (a square falling apple and circular shadow), which demands reasoning over attributes and geometry.

UnifiedReward-Flex yields clear improvements on both dynamic quality and compositional semantics. For example, on the quality side, it notably boosts the Dynamic Degree score (from 58.6 to 70.8), indicating that our reward provides more informative supervision for motion-intensive generations beyond static appearance. On the semantic side, it substantially improves Spatial Relationship (72.6 to 80.8) and Color consistency (87.7 to 89.6), suggesting better prompt grounding in relational and attribute-level constraints. Compared with VideoReward and UnifiedReward-Think, while both baselines also achieve competitive results, their improvements are less pronounced; in particular, they incur drops on Dynamic Degree, indicating limited ability to encourage richer motion. This contrast further supports that our context-personalized evaluation provides more effective reward supervision for GRPO-based video post-training. Qualitatively, Fig. 4 shows that using UnifiedReward-Flex as the reward for GRPO yields more coherent videos under motionand interaction-centric prompts. In the upper-left example (Two AI models fighting in Mortal Kombat), the base Wan2.1-T2V-14B output is largely static, and GRPO with VideoReward or UnifiedReward-Think often further dampens the motion dynamics, resulting in reduced action amplitude and weaker interaction intensity across frames. In contrast, UnifiedReward-Flex-guided GRPO preserves stronger, continuous motion and clearer contact-driven progression, better matching the prompts intent. 12 Figure 6 Qualitative Results of Text-to-Video Generation during Training Progress.

            "content": "Effect of DPO Alignment. As shown in Tab. 1, applying DPO yields consistent improvements, validating the role of preference alignment in sharpening preference discrimination. Importantly, the gains persist even in the Both correct setting, where both sampled traces predict the correct final preference. In this harder regime, DPO provides supervision on how the decision is reached: explicitly preferring higher-quality, more context-adaptive reasoning trajectories further improves discriminative accuracy by separating subtle quality differences that are invisible to decision-level correctness alone. Together, these results motivate coupling personalized criterion composition with reasoning-aware preference alignment to build robust reward models for both image and video generation. Hyperparameter Analysis of 𝛼. We analyze the impact of 𝛼 in Tab. 6, which controls the balance between the averaged dimension-wise win rate ( 𝑅dim) and the overall win rate (𝑅overall) in our reward model. When 𝛼 = 0, the model relies solely on the overall win rate, potentially overlooking finer, context-specific details, resulting in suboptimal performance. As 𝛼 increases, the model shifts focus towards dimension-wise rewards, capturing more context-adaptive nuances. However, when 𝛼 = 1, the model becomes overly focused on dimension-wise rewards, limiting its ability to assess broader, global preferences. Our results show that 𝛼 = 0.7 strikes an optimal balance, combining context-aware reasoning with global quality assessment, leading to the best performance across both image and video generation tasks. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of our personalized multi-dimensional rewards in enhancing the models preference alignment."

Fixed scorers and Bradley-Terrystyle models (e.g., PickScore, HPSv3) are the most efficient, as they directly output scalar rewards without explicit reasoning. However, this efficiency comes at the cost of coarse and less comprehensive reward signals with limited expressiveness. Reasoning-based VLMs introduce additional overhead. Specifically, UnifiedReward-Think is noticeably slower, since it performs long-chain reasoning under fixed evaluation rubric to produce judgments. Our UnifiedReward-Flex further increases the computation cost, as it goes beyond fixed criteria and conducts context-personalized reasoning: it dynamically 13 Figure 7 Monitoring Training Progress via CLIP Score. instantiates fine-grained sub-criteria and, when necessary, introduces new high-level dimensions conditioned on the prompt intent and visual evidence, rather than applying static checklist. Despite this extra compute, UnifiedReward-Flex delivers substantially stronger reward accuracy (Tab. 1) and consistently larger gains in GRPO for both image and video generation (Tabs. 3 and 4). These results indicate that the added training cost is reasonable and practical trade-off for improved alignment quality and generation performance. Training Progress Visualization. Quantitatively. Fig. 7 visualizes the training dynamics when using CLIP score as proxy metric to monitor semantic alignment during GRPO with UnifiedReward-Flex. Across both text-to-image (FLUX.1-dev) and text-to-video (Wan2.1-T2V-14B) settings, the CLIP score exhibits clear and consistent upward trend over training steps, indicating steadily improved prompt-image/video semantic consistency. The similarly stable increase in both domains suggests that our personalized, context-adaptive reward provides reliable optimization signals, reinforcing semantic understanding for both static image synthesis and temporal video generation. Qualitatively. Figs. 5 and 6 show consistent visual improvement trend during GRPO when using UnifiedReward-Flex as the reward. For image generation  (Fig. 5)  , later checkpoints better enforce prompt-critical constraints and compositional intent (e.g., the chest engraving becomes clearer and more faithful), indicating stronger semantic grounding beyond surface aesthetics. For video generation  (Fig. 6)  , the origami-dancer example evolves from limited, less coordinated motion to smoother, more coherent action progression with improved temporal consistency across frames. Overall, these training-time visualizations corroborate that UnifiedReward-Flex provides reliable, context-adaptive reward guidance that steadily strengthens both semantic adherence and temporal coherence during training."

By coupling dynamic hierarchical assessment with context-adaptive reasoning, our approach transcends rigid rubrics to capture the nuanced and subjective nature of human preferences. Leveraging two-stage training pipeline, i.e., structured reasoning distillation and reasoning-aware Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we demonstrate that UnifiedReward-Flex yields significantly more precise and context-sensitive reward signals. Empirical validation within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework reveals that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant improvements in both visual fidelity and semantic alignment for image and video synthesis."
