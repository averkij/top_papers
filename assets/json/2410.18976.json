The proposed CAMEL-Bench covers eight diverse and challenging domains: multimodal understanding and reasoning, OCR and documents, charts and diagrams, videos, cultural-specific content, medical images, agricultural images, and remote sensing understanding in Arabic. CAMEL-Bench covers 38 sub-domains with over 29K questions carefully curated by native Arabic speakers to rigorously evaluate essential skills desired in Arabic LMMs. Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently achieved significant advancements across broad spectrum of tasks, including visual reasoning, perception, and multimodal understanding. Closed-source models such as GPT-4V and open-source LMMs, such as LLaVA [28] have demonstrated effectiveness in tasks like image captioning [43], visual ques1* Equal Contributions tion answering (VQA) [24, 25], and complex visual reasoning [12]. These recent developments have led to the introduction of different benchmarks to evaluate the performance of open and closed-source LMMs. Despite these advances, most existing LMM benchmarks are English-centric, limiting their applicability to other languages [44]. With over 400 million speakers, Arabic is the 5th most widely spoken languages globally. In the context of large Figure 2. CAMEL-Bench examples spanning eight diverse domains, encompassing wide range of visual data types and tasks. language models (LLMs), there exist various attempts in developing Arabic LLMs [19, 48] which has also led to the introduction of Arabic LLM benchmarks [21]. In the context of LMMs, few recent works explore Arabic-centric evaluations in certain areas such as, scientific exams [13], cultural aspects [4, 46], Arabic question answers and documents [1, 34]. However, there is still lack of comprehensive and diverse Arabic LMM evaluation benchmark (see Tab. 1) to rigorously evaluate and study LMMs for Arabic. To address the aforementioned issue, we introduce the first comprehensive Arabic LMM evaluation benchmark, named CAMEL-Bench. CAMEL-Bench is designed to encompass wide range of tasks and focus on the Arabicspeaking population. It spans eight diverse domains and 38 sub-domains (see Fig. 1). The eight domains are: Multimodal understanding and reasoning, OCR and document understanding, chart and diagram understanding, video understanding, cultural-specific understanding, medical image understanding, Agricultural image understanding, and remote sensing understanding. Further, the 38 sub-domains (see Fig. 1) covered by our CAMEL-Bench are: visual understanding and reasoning, object hallucination evaluation, math and logic reasoning, scientific reasoning, VQA, infographics VQA, complex visual perception, real-world spatial understanding, multi-image understanding, objectlevel perception, newsletter, powerpoint slides, scene text, handwriting, lines, books, documents, charts, diagrams, tables, general video scenes, cultural-specific occasions, countries and landmarks in videos, countries and landmarks in images, food, celebrities, cultural VQA, basic medical science, clinical medicine, public health, pharmacy, diagnosis, medical understanding, plant types, fruit and veggies idenDomain/Characteristics Exams-V* CVQA* Henna KHATT CAMEL-Bench Multimodal Und. & Reasoning OCR & Docs Und.

Our CAMEL-Bench comprises 29,036 questions (see Fig. 2) and follows an extensive manual verification process by native-speakers to ensure the resulting benchmark is of high-quality. We conduct extensive experiments using open and closed-source LMMs. Our results reveal the need for substantial improvement in handling of Arabic multimodal data, shedding light on the areas requiring further Arabic LMM improvements. 2. CAMEL-Bench 2.1. Data Collection Our dataset encompasses eight diverse domains to ensure versatile multi-task Arabic LMM benchmark for different real-world scenarios. Each domain is further sub-divided into different sub-domains, each focusing on distinct aspect.

These data sources are carefully translated and verified to ensure quality and relevance. available Arabic multimodal data samples or employ samples from existing English-centric LMM benchmarks. These English samples are then translated to Arabic via GPT-4o and verified. Alternatively, we manually collect and generate the Arabic samples for remaining sub-domains from internet. Tab. 2 presents the details of different data sources used for data collection for the 38 sub-domains corresponding to eight domains, with around 29k questions in total. 2.2. Question-Answers Pairs Generation We note that major part of our original Arabic data is not derived from ready-made VQA datasets. Some sub-domains, such as celebrities and food, consist of image-only data, while others, like Pexels countries and landmarks, contain image-caption pairs. To create rich and diverse VQA corpus, we first ensure that each image is accompanied by detailed contextual information. This context is sourced from combination of Wikipedia (e.g., for food-related data), manual curation (e.g., for countries and landmarks in videos), and AI-generated content based on manually provided context (e.g., for diagrams and infographics). Next, we generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for each sample using the GPT-4o model. The prompt is meticulously crafted to adhere to key criteria: each sample generates three multiple-choice questions (MCQs), with four distinct, non-synonymous options per question, only one of which is correct. The questions contain no embedded hints, ensuring that answers are derived exclusively from the image, without requiring prior knowledge. Additionally, the image must provide enough information to fully support the correct answer, eliminating the need for guesswork. In total, this process produces corpus of 4.4K generated questions with 17.7K answers, enabling comprehensive set of questions for evaluation. Figure 3. The CAMEL-Bench Filtering and Verification Pipeline consists of two paths: Original Arabic and translated Arabic. For original Arabic (top row), 20% random sample undergoes manual verification; if errors are below 40%, the data passes; otherwise, the entire sub-category is reviewed. For Translated Arabic (bottom row), We employ Qwen7B model [8] to assess semantic similarity between the original and translated question-answer pairs on fuzzy-basis evaluation. Pairs passing the evaluation proceed, while those that fail undergo manual review. Based on this, data may require Manual Handling for manual re-translation, Refine & Verify for refinement through the model, or Non-Translated Review where the data is re-sent for translation due to the absence of an Arabic version. 2.3. Data Filtering and Verification 3. CAMEL-Bench Benchmark Evaluation The data collection and question-answer pair generation process lead to over 41k questions in total which then undergoes to filtering and verification process. The CAMEL-Bench filtering and verification process (see Fig. 3) is carefully conducted based on whether the QA text is originally Arabic or translated into Arabic from English language. For all sub-domains derived from original Arabic context, we take 20% randomly sampled subset for manual verification. In case if the error remains less below 40% threshold, the sub-category is accepted into CAMEL-Bench. Alternatively, the entire sub-category undergoes manual review. In case of the translated Arabic data from English, the original English context is also incorporated into the filtering and verification process. Here, Qwen7B [8] is used to compare the semantic similarity between the English and the English-translated data at the QA-pair level using fuzzy evaluation. To ensure the model understands semantic similarity in Arabic, we provided 5 few-shots prompting. Subsequently, QA-pairs rejected by Qwen7B [8] are manually reviewed, resulting in one of three outcomes. Manual Handling implying that data requires full re-translation. Refine and Verify referring that the translation can be refined using the model. Non-Translated Review implying that the non-translated data is re-sent to the model for translation. Consequently, we obtain 29,036 high-quality questions. Evaluation Metrics: Our evaluation framework is designed with three specialized metrics, each carefully aligned to different types of datasets and tasks. For MCQ datasets like MMT [56] and MMMU [58], we utilize exact match accuracy to ensure precise evaluation. For optical character recognition (OCR) datasets, such as PATS [3] and Evarest [18], where accurate text extraction is critical, we adopt edit distance [45] as the key metric. For more flexible datasets like VQAv2 [17], MathVista [33], and GeoChat [22], where multiple synonymous answers can be considered correct. we implement fuzzy evaluation method for all such datasets. This approach uses GPT-4o to compare the predicted answer with the ground truth, while accounting for the context of the question. By incorporating these diverse metrics, our evaluation provides robust and comprehensive assessment that adapts to the unique demands and response formats of each dataset. Tab. 3 presents comparative evaluation of five different models on range of multimodal (MM) understanding tasks, each assessing the capabilities of the models in distinct domains. The models include GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini1.5-Pro, Gemini-1.5-Flash, and Qwen2-VL-2B, evaluated on key tasks such as multimodal reasoning, OCR & document understanding, chart & diagram interpretation, video analysis, and several domain-specific tasks like cultural understanding, medical imaging, agricultural (agro) understanding, and remote sensing. GPT-4o excels across tasks, leading in MM reasoning (57.90), chart/diagram understanding (73.57), Method GPT-4o GPT-4o-mini Gemini-1.5-Pro Gemini-1.5-Flash Pangea-7B Qwen2-VL-2B InternVL2-8B LLaVa-NeXt-7B MM Understanding OCR & Document Charts & Diagram Understanding Understanding & Reasoning Video Cultural Specific Medical Understanding Understanding Remote Sensing Imaging Specific Understanding Agro 57.90 48.82 46.67 45.58 40.09 40.59 30.41 26. 59.11 42.89 36.59 33.59 26.47 25.68 15.91 19.12 73.57 64.98 47.06 48.25 38.87 27.83 30.27 27.56 74.27 68.11 42.94 53.31 49.01 38.90 51.42 44.90 80.86 65.92 56.24 46.54 20.34 34.27 20.88 28.30 49.90 47.37 33.77 42.86 31.99 29.12 29.48 22.54 80.75 79.58 72.12 76.06 74.51 52.02 44.47 42. 22.85 16.93 17.07 14.95 6.67 12.56 5.36 8.33 Table 3. Performance comparison of different closed-and open-source LMMs on CAMEL-Bench. We present per-domain results of seven LMMs: GPT-4o [38], GPT-4o-mini [38], Gemini-1.5-Pro [2], Gemini-1.5-Flash [2], Pangea-7B [59], Qwen2-VL [9], InternVL28B [11], and LLaVaNeXt-7B [29]. GPT-4o excels in most domains, while GPT-4o-mini offers an impressive balance of performance and model size. All models struggle with remote sensing, medical imaging, OCR & document understanding, and general multimodal understanding and reasoning domains. Open-source models like InternVL2-8B and LLaVaNeXt-7B show decline in performance across domains, with their best results in video understanding. Figure 4. Qualitative example highlighting different scenarios where different closed-weight models struggle on CAMEL-Bench. The correct response is shown in green, and the incorrect one in the red box.

The correct response is shown in green, and the incorrect one in the red box. video analysis (74.27), cultural (80.86) and agro-specific understanding (80.75). Models perform well on MCQs and binary-option tasks due to guessing probability and context. Infographics, designed for easy interpretation, also see high accuracy across all models. In contrast, Arabic OCR tasks, particularly in datasets like Khatt, historical documents prove exceptionally challenging. This difficulty stems from the complex nature of Arabic script, which uses ligatures and diacritics (small markings that alter pronunciation and meaning). Remote sensing understanding also remains difficult, with scores like 22.85 (GPT-4o) and 16.93 (Qwen2-VL-2B), highlighting the complexities of interpreting satellite imagery. Among the open-source models evaluated on our Arabic multimodal benchmark, Pangea-7B stands out by outperforming InternVL2-8B and LLaVaNeXt-7B in key areas. It achieves higher scores in multimodal understanding and reasoning (40.09), OCR and document understanding (26.47), and charts and diagram understanding (38.87). This suggests that Pangea-7Bs multilingual and culturally diverse training data enhance its ability to handle complex tasks across different languages and cultures. However, similar to other open-source models, Pangea-7B struggles in remote sensing understanding, scoring 6.67, highlighting challenges with specialized tasks. Overall, Pangea-7Bs performance underscores the benefits of incorporating diverse linguistic and cultural data in training multilingual multimodal LLMs while indicating areas for improvement. The Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 highlight critical challenge in Arabic multimodal understanding, where all models fail to accurately interpret the linguistic context in the provided CAMEL-Bench samples. This underscores the complexity of Arabic linguistics, especially in multimodal tasks, and the need for more robust language models that can effectively integrate both visual and textual information in Arabic contexts. 4. Conclusion, Limitations and Societal Impact We present comprehensive and diverse benchmark, named CAMEL-Bench, for Arabic LMM evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, CAMEL-Bench is the first comprehensive Arabic LMM benchmark comprising eight diverse domains and 38 sub-domains with around 29k questions that are filtered from larger pool of 41k samples with the quality verified by native speakers. We conduct extensive evaluations of openand closed-source LMMs, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in different areas for future Arabic LMM development. Although our CAMEL-Bench strives to significantly contribute towards developing sophisticated Arabic LMMs, we note that it mainly covers modern standard Arabic and does not fully explore other Arabic dialects. As the data samples are either based on existing datasets or new data that is crawled from the internet, it is possible that CAMEL-Bench exhibits biases already existing in the benchmarks. Nevertheless, we believe CAMEL-Bench is step towards the inclusion of Arabic language and Arabicspeaking populations in accessing the benefits of LMMs."
