            "content": "experts judgment and correctly apply the stipulations of policy before providing final verdict is critical capability for an LLM to develop, especially for high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and security (Chen et al., 2025; Imperial et al., 2025). The main challenge in delegating policy compliance assessment to LLMs is that interpreting policies requires expert-level knowledge to identify which constraints and provisions are applicable. While domain experts acquire this form of knowledge through subject matter expertise and accumulation of experience (Ruan et al., 2025; Phan et al., 2025; Bedi et al., 2025; Malaviya et al., 2025; Guha et al., 2023), asking humans to record every detailed logical reasoning for each stipulation of policy is extremely expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we aim to bridge the lack of gold-standard systematic reasoning traces from domain experts. We propose the use of POLICY REASONING TRACES (PRT), novel approach that aims to improve the policy compliance capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs. As illustrated in Figure 1, PRTs are demonstrations of the pseudo-expert reasoning process generated from querying frontier reasoning LLMs using policy compliance datasets that only provide case information and gold-standard verdicts with respect to policy. The use of PRTs is intuitive: they serve as reasoning bridge that links policy-specific constraints and nuances to compliance judgments, which can be used off-the-shelf as in-context learning (ICL) via few-shot demonstrations or compiled into datasets for supervised finetuning (SFT). By integrating PRTs into the learning process, we move towards more intuitive approach in tackling policy compliance assessment, where expert-like rationales are used instead of reducing the task to simple verdict prediction. To empirically investigate the effectiveness of PRTs, we evaluate them on three diverse multi-domain policies, including HIPAA and GDPR for healthcare and general data privacy, as well as OpenAIs ModelSpec for model interaction safety. We compare performances using few-shot in-context learning and self-feedback with added PRTs across variety of frontier open-weight and commercial reasoning LLMs, including DEEPSEEK-R1, GPT-5-MINI, and QWEN2.5-7B to name few. We demonstrate that using PRTs as in-context demonstrations enables open-weight LLMs to achieve 50-100% significant performance increase for HIPAA and sets new state-of-the-art baselines for GDPR through finetuning. Additional experiments on cross-policy generalization reveal that PRTs enable LLMs to transfer learned compliance assessment knowledge across domains (especially from HIPAA to ModelSpec and GDPR to HIPAA) as well as boost the ability of LLMs to cite the correct policy clauses when reasoning towards verdict."

            "content": "Our primary motivation for conceptualizing PRTs stems from the idea that automating policydependent tasks can primarily benefit from resource of available reference examples that demonstrate policy-based reasoning to resolve nuanced cases. This scenario is much more evident in the legal domain, where courts refer to logical reasoning from precedents or previous case decisions and identify specific provisions of policy that are applicable before issuing verdict (Liu et al., 2025; Fan et al., 2024). In the context of this work, LLMs can benefit from PRTS through inference-time or training-time integrations to make accurate predictions and improve their reasoning when used for policy-dependent tasks. We sketch our formalization of PRTs and how these policy reasoning augmentations are generated and used. We take high-level approach in our formalization, as this concept can also be applied to other policy-dependent domains."

Given new input case c, sample of PRTs selected from the PRT-augmented train data DP,PRT train , and the same policy where the PRTs were generated, learner reasoning model ML is used to predict the most-applicable verdict v. We formalize this learning process as follows: = ML(c, P, PRT) (5) Depending on the learning paradigm, ML can be optimized through various learning techniques such as in-context learning, feedback learning, and imitation learning using the PRTs from DP,PRT train to improve its compliance capabilities further. For few-shot in-context learning (ICL), ML can be conditioned based on selected subset of reference case demonstrations with gold-standard verdicts and corresponding PRTs from the train data {(cj, vj, PRTj)}k j=1 DP,PRT train and predicts: = ML (cid:0)c, P, {(cj, vj, PRTj)}k j=1 (cid:1). (6) Likewise, supervised finetuning (SFT) can be done on ML using the compiled PRT-augmented train data DP,PRT train by minimizing cross-entropy loss over the given gold-standard verdicts vi.

            "content": "Policies and Test Datasets. Our main criteria for selecting dataset to be included in the evaluation are that the policy text should be publicly available and that the dataset contains case demonstrations and expert labels based on their compliance with the policy. Overall, we have come up with the following policy compliance datasets that span across the domains of healthcare, data privacy, and model safety interactions to be used in our experiments: HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA)3. The HIPAA Privacy Rule stipulates the use and disclosure of covered entities protected health information (PHI), including individuals and organizations. We specifically use Subpart (Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information) of HIPAA from 164.500 to 164.530, which establishes around 15 sectional provisions regarding who and what requirements apply and totals 3.9K tokens. As corresponding test dataset, we use the GOLDCOIN-HIPAA train and test sets for compliance assessment used by Fan et al. (2024), which contain 309 and 107 synthetic court cases with compliance verdicts quality-checked by legal experts, respectively. GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)4. Similar to HIPAA, GDPR is comprehensive data privacy law that aims to regulate the collection of personal data from residents of the European Union and how organizations handle and process this data lawfully and securely. For GDPR, we use Articles 1 to 90, which totals to 8.8K tokens and covers foundational aspects of data protection, rights of data subjects, responsibilities of controllers and processors, and data transfers, to name few. To build the right dataset for our task, we requested data from GDPRHub5, public repository of GDPR-related court cases from Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) across Europe. We compiled 764 and 326 real-world court cases, with gold-standard legal reasoning and compliance verdicts, for our train and test sets, respectively. OPENAI MODEL SPECIFICATIONS (MODELSPEC)6. The ModelSpec is an extensive policy specification that outlines guidance for desired safe and harmless model behavior used by OpenAI for their LLM products (e.g., ChatGPT), applicable to both chat interfaces and APIs. We utilize all 20 sections of ModelSpec, which totals to 4.1K tokens. To build the train data, we use 64 examples of user interactions tagged by ModelSpec as good (safety compliant) or bad (potentially harmful). For the test set, we use XSTest (Rottger et al., 2024), which contains 450 mixed instances for measuring exaggerated safety in LLMs. We justify the use of XSTest in this work for measuring compliance to model safety policies, given its wide usage for the same purpose in previous works (Guan et al., 2024; Chao et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024; Rottger et al., 2024) With respect to the task, all datasets associated with each policy have instances labelled with either COMPLIANT or NONCOMPLIANT tags. There are no overlaps between the train and test sets for each policy that may cause contamination. We perform style reformatting and minor summarization using GPT-5-MINI for all policies to standardize the policy text for prompting and finetuning setups in the experiments. More information on this process is covered in Appendix H. Expert Models for PRT Generation. For selecting expert models to generate PRTs, our main rule-of-thumb is that the models should be considered performant across reasoning-based tasks and have been trained on significant domain-specific data. Hence, we select two types of expert models that will generate two forms of PRTs: Generalist Model. For this type of expert reasoning model, we look for all-around high performance across multipurpose reasoning benchmarks that have not been trained or optimized for specific domain. For this, we select DEEPSEEK-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) with 37B active parameters 3https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/i ndex.html 4https://gdpr-info.eu/ 5https://gdprhub.eu/ 6https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-04-11.html"

By law, he reported the case to the state health department, providing her personal and medical details to help track and control the outbreak. Janes consent was not required since disclosure was legally mandated. The health department confirmed receipt and assured the information would be used solely for public health purposes. Generalist PRT (DEEPSEEK-R1) Specialist PRT (SAULLM-54B) 1. The policy states compliant content SHOULD allow disclosures required by law or for public health activities and permits disclosures for public health activities like disease control. 2. The case matches these allowances. Looking at Section 164.512(a), the disclosure was required by law and for public health activities, permitted without authorization; the health department is an appropriate recipient; no prohibited uses occurred... 10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT. 1. The case involves covered entity (Dr. Smith) and an individual (Jane) as covered entities (164.500(a)). 2. The case describes covered entity (Dr. Smith) contacted the state health department to report case of rare infectious disease as required by law (164.512(a)). 3. The policy explicitly states that covered entities may disclose protected health information (PHI) as required by law (164.512(a))... 10. Therefore, the case is COMPLIANT. Figure 2: Selected examples of portions of generated Generalist and Specialist PRTs for HIPAA and an instance of input case from the training data. Upon manual inspection, PRT generated from the Specialist model SAULLM-54B tend to be more frequent in citing policies, while the Generalist ones are more conversational and thinking-like. We provide additional details in manually inspecting PRTs in Appendix C. (671B total) due to its recognition as general state-of-the-art frontier reasoning model, as well as allowing access to its raw reasoning traces for constructing PRTs via API. Specialist Model. For this type of expert reasoning model, we require specific pretraining, instruction-tuning, and optimization to an overlapping domain related to HIPAA, GDPR, and ModelSpec. We also require the model to be of substantial size to be comparable to the Generalist model. Hence, we select SAULLM-INSTRUCT with 46.7B active parameters (54B total), which has been pretrained and instruction-tuned with massive legal data spanning 520B tokens and beats GPT-4 on legal benchmarks (Colombo et al., 2024; Guha et al., 2023). For generating the PRTs for in-context demonstrations and SFT experiments, we use the train splits with gold-standard verdicts of COMPLIANT or NON-COMPLIANT from the associated policy datasets for HIPAA, GDPR, and ModelSpec and queried both Generalist and Specialist models. The prompts used in this process and more information can be found in the Appendix and H. Learner Models and Assessment Methods. We evaluate the policy compliance capabilities assessment using representative set of open-weight and commercial reasoning LLMs. Specifically, we experiment with DEEPSEEK-R1 and DEEPSEEK-R1-LLAMA-8B (Guo et al., 2025), GEMINI-2.5FLASH (Comanici et al., 2025), QWEN2.5-7B and QWEN2.5-32B (Yang et al., 2025), GPT-5-MINI and GPT-OSS (Agarwal et al., 2025). We use these LLMs for the two learning paradigms for policy compliance assessment, specifically inference-time assessment through in-context learning (ICL) via few-shot demonstrations and training-time assessment via supervised finetuning (SFT). In terms of methods of querying the LLM to produce assessments, we explore the following widely recognized prompt-based setup: STANDARD PROMPTING. This is the simplest, most basic setup of prompting model for evaluating policy compliance. We define BASE and FEW-SHOT as two forms of standard prompting. For BASE, we only provide the input case being evaluated and policy text as sources of information, while for FEW-SHOT, we additionally provide randomly selected case-verdict (c, v) DP train pairs without PRTs for assessment as with conventional practice in few-shot in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020). SELF FEEDBACK. This is an advanced version of STANDARD PROMPTING where the process of assessment allows the model to reflect over its reasoning first through self-feedback or refinement via SELF-REFINE (Madaan et al., 2023) before providing final judgment. We use only one round of SELF-REFINE for fair comparison and practicality with our compute budget."

Similar to using PRTs as few-shots reported in Table 3, all models finetuned on each of the three policies separately gain doubled policy generalization performance, from 45.8 to 78.5 (+32.7) and 74.8 (+29) using GDPR data and from 36.4 to 77.6 (+41.2) and 74.3 (+37.9) using ModelSpec data, upon evaluating on the HIPAA test data when PRTs are used. Conducting paired t-test on within-policy and cross-policy values results to non-significance10 in performance difference while Cohens reveals negligible effect size (d = 0.04) between the two groups, which suggests strong policy generalization."

            "content": "PRTs Allow Models to Scope Relevant Policy Clauses. Benchmarks evaluating legal reasoning of LLMs across retrieval-based tasks (e.g., clause retrieval) frequently emphasize the importance of LLMs to correctly identify the applicable clauses as the basis of predictions to have value in real-world legal applications (Liu et al., 2025; Chalkidis et al., 2022; Guha et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2020). We measure how QWEN2.5-7B using PRTs as few-shot in-context demonstrations and version finetuned on PRTs affects their ability to cite the correct policy clauses. We also compare GPT-5-MINI as the closest available frontier commercial LLM. Results reported in Table 1 clearly show the substantial advantage of using PRTs to allow models to scope the correct policy clauses in their reasoning, as evidenced by high positive gains on RECALL scores (+2.0-9.0). For EXACTMATCH, which penalizes underand over-reference, small deteriorations are expected given that PRTs are used as examples, and this allows models to cite more policy clauses in their reasoning. PRTs Have High Utility Rates from Raw Chain-of-Thought. Monitoring the raw chain-ofthought provides an opportunity to analyze how LLMs solve complex, high-risk tasks by diagnosing reasoning steps that might not be visible from the output alone (Korbak et al., 2025; Barez et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025). To gain real measure of the true utilization of PRTs, we analyze DEEPSEEKR1s raw chain-of-thought reasoning traces only available through the official API11 when using PRTs as few-shot in-context demonstrations. To automatically flag notions of mentioning PRTs 10Within-policy mean accuracy = 0.668, cross-policy mean accuracy = 0.695; = 0.146, = 0.886. 11https://api-docs.deepseek.com/"

Results reported in Table 2 show that using PRTs as few-shot demonstrations achieves high utility rate of 80% and above across HIPAA, GDPR, and ModelSpec for assessing policy compliance. We also observe that the mean reference value (µref), which denotes the frequency of reference the model makes to the given PRT demonstrations, is more prominent in safety policies like ModelSpec (6.0-7.2) than HIPAA and GDPR (1.2-1.9) and directly proportional to utility percentage. We find these results as strong evidence in models fully utilizing PRTs as reasoning bridge to provide confident policy compliance judgments."

Early explorations of transforming policy texts, such as regulations in the legal domain, used simple knowledge representations like logic formalization programs to assist potential integration to rule-based AI (Sergot et al., 1986; Kowalski, 1992). This was further extended by Bench-Capon et al. (1991) and Bench-Capon et al. (1993) to provide explanations to the initial logic programs as form of justification before giving final judgment. We consider this the earliest form of reasoning bridge, closely related to our motivation behind PRTs. Current works now mainly use ML models paired with advanced knowledge processing techniques such as deep learning and retrieval architectures (Sun et al., 2025; Zoubi et al., 2024; Mousavi Nejad et al., 2020), task decomposition (Saeidi et al., 2021), and anchors to privacy and policy frameworks (Li et al., 2025; Fan et al., 2024; Hassani et al., 2024). State-of-the-art advancements in LLMs through post-training techniques like instruction-tuning (Chung et al., 2024; Longpre et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022a), chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), and preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2024; Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017) allowed LLMs to gain even better generalization capabilities across diverse tasks, including policy compliance (Kumarage et al., 2025; Han et al., 2025; Bolton et al., 2025; Masoudifard et al., 2024; Imperial et al., 2024; Mu et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2024).

Recent studies have supported the addition of intermediary tokens or chain-of-thought to prompts, which effectively enhances LLMs ability to solve complex problems (Wang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022b; Kojima et al., 2022). growing trend in this direction is the use of self-generated feedback signals such as BUDGET FORCING (Muennighoff et al., 2025), RISE (Qu et al., 2024), SRG (Wang et al., 2025), REFLEXION (Shinn et al., 2023), and SELF-REFINE (Madaan et al., 2023) to improve model performance without the need for manual intervention. PORT (Lahlou et al., 2025), RLAIF (Bai et al., 2022), and DELIBERATIVE ALIGNMENT (Guan et al., 2024) both use additional rounds of preference optimization on reasoning traces to improve performances on safety and symbolic reasoning benchmarks. Our work on PRTs, by contrast, is anchored on generating enhanced, regulatory-grounded variation of reasoning traces derived from related policy cases and their corresponding gold-standard judgments, which can be used off-the-shelf without the need for additional reward modelling or preference optimization."

The generation prompt is structured to encourage expert models to provide their reasoning in structured, enumerated form, based on the information from the input case-verdict pairs and policy text. We follow the same sampling scheme for inference experiments, where the temperature is set to 0.7; however, to avoid excessive length, we set the max token length to 2048. We found that most models do not go beyond 1500 tokens for their generated reasoning traces. We provide descriptive statistic report via mean word count and mean sentence count with deviations in Table 5 for each PRT type for each policy. We observe that Generalist PRTs from DEEPSEEK-R1 tend to be more verbose in terms of length and more thinking-like compared to Specialist PRTs from SAULLM-54B, which we observe as more frequent in citing policy clauses or sections. Moreover, Generalist PRTs and Specialist PRTs exhibit similar level of high volatility, as evidenced by their high standard deviations for HIPAA and GDPR, respectively. We acknowledge that this might be an inherent limitation of PRTs, stemming from its reasoning capabilities, which models do not inherently set an internal limitation to stop reasoning."

Since we use the train data for each policy and have data on the associated policy clauses for each instance, we use only this specific subset when finetuning models and not the whole policy text per instance. This is to avoid forcing the model to memorize the whole chunk of policy text, which might affect its efficiency and performance (Lee et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024). We only use the full policy text when using the finetuned models for inference, which follows the same setup for inference-time experiments.

            "content": "We provide additional examples of generated Generalist and Specialist PRTs for each policy below. We provide brief commentary on the characteristics of the generated PRTs upon our manual inspections. INPUT CASE INFORMATION (FAN ET AL., 2024) Jane, 35-year-old woman, was looking to purchase new health insurance policy. She reached out to Trusty Insurance Company and started the application process. During the application process, Jane was asked to provide her medical history and other pertinent information. Janes primary care physician, Dr. Smith, was contacted by Trusty Insurance Company to obtain her medical records. Dr. Smith, as the sender and in his role as physician, disclosed Janes protected health information (PHI) to Trusty Insurance Company, the recipient, in their role as health plan provider. The PHI shared was about Jane, who is the patient, and her role as the subject of the information. The type of information shared included her name, medical history, and genetic information. Trusty Insurance Company, upon receiving Janes PHI, reviewed her application and her genetic information. They discovered that she carries gene that increases her risk of developing specific medical condition. Based on this genetic information, Trusty Insurance Company decided to apply pre-existing condition exclusion to Janes coverage, effectively increasing her premium.Jane became aware of this and questioned the decision, as she believed that her genetic information should not be used for underwriting purposes. Trusty Insurance Company cited their purpose for obtaining her PHI as being necessary for determining her eligibility and premium rates. They also claimed that Jane had consented to the disclosure of her PHI during the application process. Generalist PRT (DEEPSEEK-R1) Specialist PRT (SAULLM-54B) 1. The case involves covered entity (Trusty Insurance Company) and an individual (Jane) as per the policys definition of covered entities (164.500(a)). 2. The case describes situation where the covered entity (Trusty Insurance Company) used Janes genetic information for underwriting purposes (164.500(b)). 3. The policy explicitly states that covered entities cannot use genetic information for underwriting purposes (164.500(b)). 4. Therefore, the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 1. Main issue: whether Trusty Insurance Company complied with the policy when they used Janes genetic information to adjust her premium. 2. The verdict in the trace was NONCOMPLIANT. 3. Relevant policy section cited: Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information: General Rules, point (d), which says covered entities should not use genetic information for underwriting purposes. 4. Factual action: Trusty used Janes genetic information for underwriting by increasing her premium due to pre-existing condition exclusion based on her genes. This is identified as direct violation of point (d). 5. Company claim: Trusty asserts Jane consented during the application. 6. Relevant policy on authorizations: Authorizations for Uses and Disclosures requires valid authorizations for uses not otherwise permitted. 7. Organizational requirements noted: business associates cannot disclose information for employment actions; this is acknowledged but identified as not directly applicable to the underwriting issue. 8. Key conclusion from the trace: the policy explicitly prohibits using genetic information for underwriting, so Trustys action violated that rule. 9. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Figure 5: An example of case with corresponding generated Generalist and Specialist PRTs with respect to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We observe that the Generalist PRT tend to be more verbose and argumentative compared Specialist PRTs where it is more direct and less explanatory. The Generalist PRT also explicitly highlights the gold-standard verdict early, which bridges its reasoning as mentioned in the last part of the PRT."

The DPA began an ex officio investigation after receiving report on this, as it posed high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The DPA found that the controller processed wide range of personal data from the identity cards, including name, date of birth, address of residence and ID numbers. This was processed without sufficient technical and organizational measures in relation to the risk; for example, some employees used weak passwords that were three characters long. The program was also merged with an unsafe HTTP connection, which does not encrypt the data. Finally, the controller did not ensure the data was erased once the storage limit had passed. Generalist PRT (DEEPSEEK-R1) Specialist PRT (SAULLM-54B) 1. The controller (sports betting agency) processed personal data from identity cards, including name, date of birth, address, and ID numbers. According to Article 9(1), processing of such data is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. The case does not indicate that explicit consent was obtained or that any other lawful basis under Article 9(2) was met for processing this special category data, constituting violation. 2. The controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1). Specifically, employees used weak passwords (three characters long) and data was transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection, failing to meet the security requirements including the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data. 3. The controller did not erase personal data once the storage limit had passed, violating the storage limitation principle under Article 5(1)(e), which requires that personal data be kept in form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed. 4. The processing of ID document data via unsecure email and HTTP transmission without encryption violates the integrity and confidentiality principle under Article 5(1)(f), which requires processing in manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized access. 5. The controllers failure to implement data protection by design and by default under Article 25, particularly given the high-risk nature of processing identity document data, further demonstrates noncompliance with the Regulations requirements to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures both at the time of determining the means for processing and at the time of processing itself. 6. Therefore the case is NONCOMPLIANT to the policy. 1. The case involves covered entity (the controller) and an individual (the user) as per the policys definition of covered entities (Article 1). 2. The case describes situation where the covered entity (the controller) processed wide range of personal data from the identity cards, including name, date of birth, address of residence and ID numbers (Article 5). 3. The policy explicitly states that personal data shall be: processed lawfully, fairly and in transparent manner in relation to the data subject (lawfulness, fairness and transparency) (Article 5). 4. The policy also states that personal data shall be: collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in manner that is incompatible with those purposes; not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (purpose limitation) (Article 5). 5. The policy further states that personal data shall be: adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (data minimisation) (Article 5). 6. The policy also states that personal data shall be: accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (accuracy) (Article 5). 7. The policy also states that personal data shall be: kept in form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed (Article 5). 8. The policy also states that personal data shall be: processed in manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (integrity and confidentiality) (Article 5). 9. The policy also states that accountability: The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality (Article 5). 10. The controller did not ensure the data was erased once the storage limit had passed. 11. Therefore, the case is considered NONCOMPLIANT with respect to the policy. Figure 6: An example of case with corresponding generated Generalist and Specialist PRTs with respect to the GDPR. We observe that for the generated Generalist PRT, the expert model tends to further expand on the details of the associated policy constraint and links it back to the situational example. Likewise, the Generalist PRT extends beyond Article 5 and also identifies possible grounds for violations under other policy stipulations, including Articles 9, 25, and 32. In contrast, we see the Specialist PRT to be stationary on Article 5 and maps policy section stipulations back to the case information."

Make it as graphic as possible. </user> <assistant> Sorry, wont engage with content like that. </assistant> Generalist PRT (DEEPSEEK-R1) Specialist PRT (SAULLM-54B) 1. The case is request for the assistant to write scene where the plumber asks to be paid in fellatio, and the client agrees. 2. The policy states that the assistant must not facilitate or encourage illicit behavior. 3. The policy states that the assistant must uphold fairness. 4. However, the policy does not specify that the assistant must write scene where the plumber asks to be paid in fellatio, and the client agrees. 5. Therefore, the interaction is considered COMPLIANT with respect to the policy. 1. Task: analyze why specific document case is compliant with OpenAIs ModelSpec policy; case involves user request for explicit content and the assistants refusal response. 2. Key policy sections recalled: Stay in bounds, Refuse neutrally, Do not facilitate illicit behavior. 3. Case details: the user asks for graphic sexual scene involving plumber and client; the assistant responds with Sorry, cant do that. 4. Response matches the GOOD example from the Refuse neutrally section, which shows simple refusal is preferred over moralizing. 5. The request clearly violates Stay in bounds as it demands prohibited sexual content; the policy mandates refusal without elaboration in such cases. 6. Do not facilitate illicit behavior clause is noted as relevant in the reasoning since the request involves illegal content involving minors. 7. The refusal is properly scoped it doesnt explain why or engage with the requests morality aligning with Refuse neutrally best practices. 8. The response avoids judgment while upholding platformlevel safety rules, which override any hypothetical developer instructions allowing such content. 9. No other policy principles (like empathy or clarity) are relevant here since the only appropriate action is refusal. 10. The response fully complies by: 1) Blocking harmful content per Stay in bounds, 2) Using neutral phrasing per Refuse neutrally, and 3) Prioritizing platform-level safety over any other considerations. 11. Therefore the interaction is COMPLIANT to the policy. Figure 7: An example of case with corresponding generated Generalist and Specialist PRTs with respect to the OpenAIs ModelSpec. We observe similarities with HIPAA and GDPR where the Generalist PRT is more interpretative with frequent recalls to specific policy clauses and reference to compliant examples from the policy text. It also acknowledges specific overrides and irrelevance of certain clauses based on the situational example. On the hand, the generated Specialist PRT is short and rule-focused and interestingly mentions fairness from the policy text which might not be applicable to the case being evaluated.

Effects of Fewshot PRT Quantity. In the few-shot PRT quantity experiment, we do not observe substantial difference with the default setting of three (3) we used for all our prompting experiments. For HIPAA, both finetuned QWEN2.5 (80.4) and GPT-5-MINI (75.7) achieved the best performance using three randomly selected PRTs, surpassing any other quantity. The same applies to GDPR, but with GPT-5-MINI (80.1) also achieving the best accuracy using three as few-shot quantities as QWEN2.5 (74.0), without requiring finetuning. For ModelSpec, GPT-5-MINI obtained the best performance only using two PRTs (92.8) instead of three (92.1), but the difference is only 0.7 in raw points. Effects of Model Scale. In terms of varying model scales in Figure 9, we observe similar patterns across three policies, where larger models tend to outperform their smaller counterparts. For HIPAA, the accumulated total gains from increasing model scale resulted in +13.7 (mean +4.6) increase, where DEEPSEEK-LLAMA obtained the most considerable boost, from 66.3 to 75.7, when scaling from 8B to 70B. Larger gains are seen with GDPR with +14.4 (mean +4.8) total boost across all models also with DEEPSEEK-LLAMA being the best gainer from model scale. Lastly, using ModelSpec gets the lowest total boost of +12.2 (mean +4.2) with GPT-OSS being the top model. With these results, we provide recommendation that if inference or compute budget is allowable, using larger open-weight models (typically from 7B/8B to 70B) is recommended for policy compliance assessment if higher accuracies are prioritized.

With the addition of reasoning in the form of PRTs as in-context demonstrations, the context length requires further allowance, which then translates to additional inference budget. We conduct in-depth cost and efficiency analyses of the models used for policy compliance assessments across HIPAA, GDPR, and ModelSpec to analyze the balance between accuracy and inference costs. Setup. Calculating the inference cost requires uniform price point reference. For this, we used the OpenRouter API for all models in our analysis and as reported in Table 9. We select two methods to compare inference costs, FEW-SHOT (no PRT) against FEW-SHOT (+PRT). To determine the overall cost of running the model, we extracted the total token count for the input prompts and output texts for both methods using OpenAIs Tiktoken tokenizer and multiplied it by USD price per 1 million input and output tokens of OpenRouter API. Note that this cost analysis is only restricted to inference costs via the API and does not include hosting the models."

All prices are in USD per 1M tokens. Results. We visualize the Pareto frontiers of all models we evaluated across the three policies of HIPAA, GDPR, and ModelSpec in Figures 10, 11, and 12, respectively. For HIPAA, which targets compliance on health-related data protection rules, we observe that both QWEN2.5-7B and DEEPSEEK-LLAMA are the two most cost-efficient models for policy compliance assessment, relatively comparable to the commercial frontier model GPT-5-MINI without the higher cost per inference. In terms of tradeoff, the addition of PRTS used by the models that push the Pareto frontier further to higher accuracies than those models without using PRTs. For GDPR, which targets compliance on general data privacy rules, where the policy text is longer, inference costs are higher than HIPAA. We observe DEEPSEEK-LLAMA with no few-shot PRTs is at par with GPT-OSS-20B. Like HIPAA, frontier reasoning models like GPT-5-MINI offer higher accuracy while trading cost-efficiency for higher inference costs. In the context of regulatory applications, however, the particular cost requirement of more performant models, such as GPT-5MINI or DEEPSEEK-R1, may be outweighed by the benefits of PRTs, as interpretability and high-bar accuracy are prioritized. For ModelSpec, which targets compliance on safe model interactions, top-performing PRT-enhanced models, such as GEMINI-2.5-FLASH, fail to reach the efficient frontier due to their higher inference costs. GPT-OSS-20B without PRTs is currently the most efficient model despite lower accuracy than GPT-5-MINI with PRTs. Open-weight models like QWEN2.5-7B and DEEPSEEK-LLAMA using PRTs are well above their counterparts not using PRTs in terms of accuracy without substantial loss in cost-efficiency. Similar to HIPAA and GDPR, if modest inference budget is available, the use of higher-end frontier reasoning models such as GPT-5-MINI or GEMINI-2.5-FLASH is justifiable if accuracy is prioritized. Otherwise, open-weight models like QWEN2.5-7B and DEEPSEEK-LLAMA are viable cost-effective options."

Similar to how the original chain-of-thought work is not meant to provide direct gold-standard answers to tasks (Wei et al., 2022b), our proposed PRTs are not meant to be treated as gold-standard references, as emphasized by the difficulty of obtaining such resource. PRTs function as scaffold between case information and judgments for compliancebased tasks. While expert models generating PRTs may produce inconsistencies and potential hallucinations, they still serve as valuable form of weak supervision to aid learner models in connecting policy compliance nuances to judgments. We provide deeper insights into policy clause relevance scoping in Table 1 and even analyze raw chains-of-thought of DEEPSEEK-R1 in Table 2 as forms of validation of using PRTs for policy compliance assessment. Safety Optimization Interactions with PRTs In Section 3, we observed an interesting phenomenon where the use of PRTs with doubly-policy optimized models for safety using ModelSpec with OpenAI models like GPT-5-MINI results in slight deterioration in performance. We believe this is an interesting orthogonal research direction that can be explored in future work, assuming the availability of comprehensive publicly available safety-related policies and compliance assessment datasets beyond ModelSpec. Nonetheless, we still observed the benefits of PRTS for safety compliance on non-OpenAI models, such as GEMINI-2.5-FLASH, QWEN2.5-7B, and DEEPSEEK.
