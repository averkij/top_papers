Introduction With the recent advancement of the neural rendering algorithm [Barron et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Chou et al., 2024; Fridovich-Keil et al., 2022; Johari et al., 2022; Kundu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Martin-Brualla et al., 2021; Mildenhall et al., 2021; Müller et al., 2022; Reiser et al., 2021; Suhail et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Vora et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021], several primitives have been introduced to represent the 3D scenes. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [Kerbl et al., 2023] and several extensions [Chen and Wang, 2024; Gao et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2024] have recently emerged as groundbreaking technique for novel view synthesis, offering an exceptional balance of visual fidelity and real-time performance. Concurrently, Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVR) [Li et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025] enables sparse voxel representation to perform the novel-view synthesis task. Recent studies [He et al., 2025,; Huang et al., 2025; Jang and Kim, 2025; Ji et al., 2025; Jun-Seong et al., 2025; Kerr et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2023; Marrie et al., 2025; Peng et al., 2025; Piekenbrinck et al., 2025; Qin et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024; Ying et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025] leverage the series of novel 3D primitives for open-vocabulary 3D understanding tasks, such as semantic segmentation, 3D open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS). LangSplat [Qin et al., 2024] is one of the pioneering papers that introduces 3D Gaussians for this purpose by optimizing 3DGS first and adopts Gaussian features that are trained to store language attributes derived from the 2D foundation model, CLIP [Radford et al., 2021]. The successive studies [Jang and Kim, 2025; Piekenbrinck et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2024; Ying et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025] try to improve the trainable Gaussian features by either introducing contrastive learning between different objects in the scene, or training an object-aware 3DGS model from scratch. However, these methods are limited by learning short words or tags, which hinders advanced 3D scene understanding with complex sentence queries such as the referring segmentation task, as mentioned in [He et al., 2025]. More recently, ReferSplat [He et al., 2025] proposes to cope with segmentation from complex queries, and focus on the 3D referring segmentation task (RES) by providing human-annotated observable objects masks and corresponding detailed natural language sentence descriptions for training. However, all the aforementioned Work has been done during an internship at NVIDIA Corresponding author & Project lead: chengs@nvidia.com 2026 NVIDIA. All rights reserved. OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Figure 1: Comparison of lifting language into 3D representations between ReferSplat [He et al., 2025] and OpenVoxel. Note that ReferSplat additionally requires manual text annotations for training 3DGS to equipped with Bert embeddings, while ours is totally training-free and do not need any additional annotations. approaches tend to leverage learned embeddings as language fields from visual-language aligned embeddings such as CLIP or DINO, limiting the capability of dealing with arbitrary textual queries [Kamath et al., 2024]. Also, obtaining detailed human annotation for training requires labor-intensive pre-processing for each scene, and training additional language fields for 3D representation is also time-consuming (more than one hour for each scene). To address these issues, we propose OpenVoxel, novel training-free framework that bypasses the speed and accuracy limitations of learning text embedding space. Instead of training 3D features to align with fixed embedding manifold, our OpenVoxel directly populates the 3D scene with rich, human-readable text captions and proceeds with text-to-text retrieval for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding, including open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) and referring expression segmentation (RES). Given Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVR) model optimized from multi-view images of 3D scene, we introduce training-free algorithm of Training-Free Sparse Voxel Grouping to cluster all voxels into object-level groups by lifting and matching per-frame 2D segmentation maps obtained from SAM2 [Ravi et al., 2024]. This aggregation is crucial for moving from per-voxel representation to semantically coherent, object-level understanding and ensuring view-consistency. To further bridge voxels with textual description, we also introduce the strategy of Canonical Scene Map Construction to locate language attributes on top of this sparse voxel representation via Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), obtaining full description of the entire scene. Finally, to answer an open-vocabulary query (e.g., simple word or complex sentence), we utilize MLLMs to perform Referring Query Inference via direct text-to-text retrieval. The MLLM compares the users query against the constructed scene map, enabling flexible and powerful retrieval process that is not constrained by embedding proximity. In summary, the contributions of our methods are listed below: training-free framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding : We introduce OpenVoxel, novel pipeline that removes the need for learning 3D language embeddings and instead performs text-to-text reasoning using LLMs on top of the sparse voxel representation. Group (object)-level captioning and scene map construction : We propose an unsupervised method that OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding clusters sparse voxels into instance-level 3D masks and generates rich, descriptive captions for each instance using an MLLM, forming an informative scene map. Superior performance in both complex and simple language queries for 3D scene understanding task : By combining instance captions with LLM-based reasoning, OpenVoxel outperforms previous studies on both open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) and referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks. 2. Related Works 3D scene representation with different primitives. Neural radiance fields (NeRF) [Barron et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Chou et al., 2024; Fridovich-Keil et al., 2022; Johari et al., 2022; Kundu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Martin-Brualla et al., 2021; Mildenhall et al., 2021; Müller et al., 2022; Reiser et al., 2021; Suhail et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Vora et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021] have established powerful paradigm for representing scenes as continuous volumetric fields, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis but suffering from slow training and rendering. To address these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [Kerbl et al., 2023] and following extensions [Chen and Wang, 2024; Gao et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2024] represent scenes using anisotropic Gaussians that can be rendered in real time, significantly improving efficiency while preserving fidelity. More recent work on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVR) [Sun et al., 2025] introduces discrete, sparse voxel representation that supports efficient rasterization-based rendering. These representations (i.e., NeRF, 3DGS, and SVR) collectively form the foundation for modern neural scene reconstruction and are increasingly adopted for downstream 3D understanding tasks. Language-aligned 3D scene representation. growing line of research [He et al., 2025,; Huang et al., 2025; Jang and Kim, 2025; Ji et al., 2025; Jun-Seong et al., 2025; Kerr et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2025; Piekenbrinck et al., 2025; Qin et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024; Ying et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025] aims to equip 3D scene representations with open-vocabulary or language-aware capabilities so that further downstream tasks [Chen et al., 2024,; Haque et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Mirzaei et al., 2023,, 2024; Wang et al., 2024,; Weber et al., 2024; Weder et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2025; Yin et al., 2023] such as 3D scene editing or inpainting are applicable. LangSplat [Qin et al., 2024] introduces language-aligned features into 3D Gaussians by distilling CLIP embeddings and multi-scale SAM [Kirillov et al., 2023] masks from multi-view images, enabling open-vocabulary 3D segmentation. OpenGaussian [Wu et al., 2024] and Dr.Splat [Jun-Seong et al., 2025] further enhance this pipeline by improving the quality of language features in Gaussian primitives through codebooks. ReferSplat [He et al., 2025] tackles the challenging 3D referring expression segmentation (RES) task, aligning Gaussian features with sentence-level embeddings and predicting object masks conditioned on natural-language sentence queries. Despite promising results, these methods rely heavily on text-encoder embedding spaces and additional human annotation of sentence-object mask pairs on the training images, which limit their practicability on new scenes and ability to interpret nuanced or arbitrarily phrased queries. In contrast, our method avoids the requirements of human-annotated description-mask pairs or embedding alignment entirely. Instead of training 3D features to match fixed latent space, we generate rich captions for 3D instances and perform direct text-to-text retrieval using MLLMs, enabling more flexible reasoning over complex queries. 3. Preliminary We start by reconstructing scenes from multi-view input images. To this end, we employ the recently emerged SVR [Sun et al., 2025], which reconstructs scenes as sparse voxel fields and achieves high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering. The reconstructed voxels are also suitable for efficiently assigning attributes to certain 3D locations, which our algorithm exploits. Their rendering follows the classical volume rendering equation, 3 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Figure 2: Overview of OpenVoxel. Taking sparse voxel model 𝑉1:𝑁 pre-trained from multi-view images 𝐼1:𝐾 and their corresponding camera pose 𝜉1:𝐾, we aim to build voxel group field ℱ1:𝑁 from segmentation masks 𝑀1:𝐾 obtained from SAM2. With ℱ1:𝑁 we render images and masks for all groups to obtain canonical captions and construct Scene Map 𝑆 recoding their position and captions. In the Referring Query Inference stage we take query description and image to find the ideal target group that matches the description by query refinement and text-to-text retrieving from 𝑆, enabling complex segmentation tasks such as referring expression segmentation (RES). which is also the one employed by NeRF [Mildenhall et al., 2021] and 3DGS [Kerbl et al., 2023]: C(r) = 𝑖<𝑁 𝑤𝑖(r) 𝑐𝑖, 𝑤𝑖(r) = 𝛼𝑖(r) (1 𝛼𝑗(r)) , 𝑗<𝑖 (1) where C(r) is the rendering result for ray r, 𝑖 goes through an ordered list of 𝑁 voxels in front of the ray, 𝑐𝑖 is the voxel attribute (usually color) to render, 𝛼𝑖(r) is the opacity of the ray passing through the voxel, and finally 𝑤𝑖(r) is the contributing weight from the voxel to the rendered ray, which is also used in our algorithm during grouping. 4. Methodology We first define the notation and problem statement of our framework. As shown in Fig. 2, given 3D scene reconstructed as 𝑁 sparse voxels {𝑉𝑖}𝑁 with their from set of 𝐾 multi-view images {𝐼𝑖 R𝐻𝑊 3}𝐾 𝑖=1 camera poses {𝜉𝑖 SE(3)}𝐾 , our goal is to assign descriptive language information to these voxels to construct 𝑖=1 scene map 𝑆 and enable open-vocabulary reasoning from natural language description 𝐷, which can be vocabulary as in 3D-OVS [Liu et al., 2023] or referring expression as in 3D-RES [He et al., 2025]. We target gradient-descent-free and latent-dimension-free approaches to save space and time. 𝑖=1 To this end, we present OpenVoxel, which consists of three main components: (1) Training-Free Sparse Voxel Grouping that groups voxels into coherent 3D instances (Sec. 4.1), (2) Canonical Scene Map Construction that stores the detailed captions and 3D spatial information for all voxel groups (Sec. 4.2), and 4 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding 1:𝑁 , Feature weight 𝑊 Figure 3: Detail of the grouping process. Taking the pre-trained voxel model 𝑉1:𝐾, we initialize the Group as empty tensors, and Group Dictionary 𝐺0 as empty dictionary. Then start Field ℱ 0 from 𝜉1, we project the SAM masks 𝑀1 to 3D voxel and update ℱ1:𝑁 , 𝑊1:𝑁 , and 𝐺. By match and merge masks from the other views repeating this process, the final ℱ1:𝑁 , 𝑊1:𝑁 , and 𝐺 is able to represent the group information of 𝑉1:𝑁 . 1:𝑁 (3) Referring Query Inference to support querying and reasoning with natural language input from users (Sec. 4.3). 4.1. Training-Free Sparse Voxel Grouping Drawing inspiration from deep hough voting [Qi et al., 2019] and spatial embedding [Neven et al., 2019], our key insight is that voxels belonging to the same object instance should cluster around common 3D center position. With this motivation, we encode group membership of voxels as 3D spatial coordinates pointing to their instance centroids. These spatial embedding, termed as group feature, is progressively updated by readily available 2D segmentation masks from foundation models like SAM2 [Ravi et al., 2024]. Our update is efficiently done in one training-free pass through all 𝐾 views without the lengthy gradient descent. In contrast, existing methods like Gaussian Grouping [Ye et al., 2024] rely on gradient descent to update per-primitive high-dimensional features with sequential training processes. Group Representations. As depicted in Fig. 3, given reconstructed scene of 𝑁 voxels, we extend voxel attributes by group feature 𝐹1:𝑁 R𝑁 3, which denotes the instance centroid the voxels belonging to, and feature weights 𝑊1:𝑁 R𝑁 indicating the confidence about the current feature. We also use Group Dictionary 𝐺 to record the spatial 5 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding centroid of each unique instance. The group features, weights, and dictionary are iteratively updated by the instance information from each frame. Lifting 2D Segmentation Maps to 3D Group Field. We first introduce our method to lift 2D instances mask into 3D voxels. Let 𝑀 be the mask with 𝑚 unique instances ID, and pts R𝐻𝑊 3 be the rendered point map of the view, which indicates the expected ray-hit R3 of each instance 𝑘 is then determined by performing position in the world space. The centroid center 𝑘 masked average reduction on the point map: center 𝑘 = 1(𝑀𝑗 = 𝑘) pts 𝑗 1(𝑀𝑗 = 𝑘) . 𝑗𝐻𝑊 𝑗𝐻𝑊 We then accumulate the instance centroids information into each voxel 𝑖 by: ℱ 𝑡+1 𝑖 = ℱ 𝑡 𝑖 + 𝑤𝑖𝑗 center 𝑀𝑗 , 𝑊 𝑡+1 𝑖 = 𝑊 𝑡 𝑖 + 𝑗𝐻𝑊 𝑤𝑖𝑗, (2) (3) where 𝑤𝑖𝑗 is the blending weight (Eq. (1)) the voxel 𝑖 contributing to the pixel 𝑗. In practice, we customize the sparse voxel renderer [Sun et al., 2025] to perform the update in one rendering pass. The update equation follows Dr.Splat [Jun-Seong et al., 2025], while we do not need the top-k sampling as our group feature is only 3-dimensional. 𝑗𝐻𝑊 Start condition. At view 𝜉1, the voxel group feature 𝐹 1 and weight 𝑊 1 are directly assigned by the information lifted from the view. The group dictionary is set to the 𝑚 instance IDs and their corresponding centroids center. Progressively Matching and Merging Segmentation Masks. When we move on to view 𝑡 + 1, we need to first match the mask IDs in 𝑀 𝑡+1 with the existing voxel grouping (𝐹 𝑡, 𝑊 𝑡, 𝐺𝑡). To this end, we render our group field into view 𝑡 + 1 as 𝑀 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗 and match existing instances with 𝑡+1 those in 𝑀 𝑡+1. The matched instance IDs are replaced with the existing IDs, while the remaining are added as new instances. Specifically, we first determine the instance ID of each voxel 𝑖 in the current iteration by: ID𝑡 𝑖 = argmin𝑗 ℱ 𝑡 𝑖 𝑊 𝑡 𝑖 𝐺𝑡 𝑗 2 , (4) where the first term is the normalized voxel voting and the second term is the centroid of each instance. We then cast rays from the processing view to retrieve the instance ID of the hit voxel, which forms instance mask 𝑀 proj reflecting the existing segmentation. Then, we conduct matching by finding the highest IoU mask in 𝑀 𝑡+1 for each instance in 𝑀 proj. We also prompt the SAM2 model again using 𝑀 proj and merge the instance masks that are largely overlapped to reduce noise and prevent the same instance from being incorrectly separated as two different IDs. As for the masks in 𝑀 𝑡+1 that are neither matched nor overlapped with the existing ones, we assign new unique ID and add them to the group dictionary. Finally, we use the updated mask from 𝑀 𝑡+1 to update the voxel group feature into (𝐹 𝑡+1, 𝑊 𝑡+1) by Eq. (3). After processing all the 𝐾 views, we use the 𝐼𝐷𝐾 from Eq. (4) as the final voxel instance grouping. It is worth noting that, with our Group Field construction strategy, even if the voxels are assigned to an incorrect group in some view, the accumulated 𝐹1:𝑁 and 𝑊1:𝑁 still force the voxel to vote the most confident group it belongs, reducing the possible miss-grouping. 6 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Figure 4: Detail of the Canonical Captioning. Given the group masks rendered of specific group (taking the green apple as example) from our group field and their corresponding images, we leverage the Describe Anything Model (DAM) to first obtain detailed caption. Then Qwen3-VL model is conducted to canonicalize the caption into fixed form, benefiting further usage. 4.2. Canonical Scene Map Construction Once voxel groups are obtained, our next goal is to construct canonical scene map 𝑆 that records the position of each group and describes each group with rich, human-readable caption, enabling open-vocabulary understanding of the entire scene  (Fig. 2)  . Instead of training 3D features to align with language embeddings, we bypass this bottleneck by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to obtain detailed and accurate canonical captions for each group. We now detail the canonical captioning process. As depicted in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, taking the green apple as an example, we render the binary masks of the corresponding group in views 𝜉1:𝐾 and use them as mask inputs together with the original images 𝐼1:𝐾 for the Describe Anything Model (DAM) [Lian et al., 2025]. DAM produces detailed description of the content inside each mask; however, its output is free-form sentence and, in some cases, uses the generic word object as the subject (e.g., green round object, possibly an apple, . . . ). To stabilize and standardize the captions across groups, we further use an MLLM (e.g., Qwen3-VL) to refine these free-form captions into fixed-form caption while considering (i) the DAM sentence, and (ii) the original masked images. Because general MLLMs are not specifically trained for mask-image captioning, we design the visual prompting strategy inspired by [Wu et al., 2024]: we darken the regions outside the mask and highlight the object with small red dot to focus the models attention. We then instruct the MLLM to rewrite the caption into the canonical template <category noun>, <appearance details> <function/affordance or partof> <placement/relation>. This converts each groups description into consistent, structured form. The resulting entry for group in 𝑆 stores its ID, 3D position (center), and the canonical caption. In practice, the canonicalization significantly reduces subject ambiguity (e.g., replacing object with apple) and yields stable, comparable descriptions across views. 7 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Table 1: Quantitative evaluation on the Ref-LeRF subset in terms of referring expression segmentation (RES) mIoU.

Referring Query Inference Given user query 𝐷from single category token (e.g., chair) to detailed referring expression (e.g., what object can be used for cutting paper?)and an optional query image of the target view, our goal is to identify the best-matching 3D instance in the scene map 𝑆, obtain its ID(s), and render the corresponding binary mask in the target view. Rather than mapping the query and all captions into learned embedding space, we perform direct retrieval over 𝑆 with multimodal LLM (MLLM). This design avoids any additional training or calibration for our 3D setting, maintains robustness to free-form phrasing that includes attributes, affordances, or light reasoning, and yields interpretable evidence because the selection is made over the canonical captions stored in 𝑆. Query Refinement. To make matching deterministic and stable, we first canonicalize the query. Following the same procedure as in our captioning stage, the MLLM rewrites 𝐷 (with or without the query image) into our fixed template <category noun>, <appearance details> <function/affordance or part-of> <placement/relation>. For instance, the free-form description funny toy with spindly legs that looks very interesting in the sunlight becomes Toy, yellow, slim legs. The refined query now matches the format of entries in 𝑆, so the retrieval process reduces to selecting the caption(s) in 𝑆 that best satisfy the refined description and returning their associated ID (In practice, we input the entire 𝑆 for the MLLM, so even if the query implies spatial relations (e.g., left of the apple), the MLLM can still possibly verify them using the stored group centers in 𝑆 before finalizing the selection. Text-to-text Retrieving of Target Group. Finally, given the selected ID(s), we render the referred object by rasterizing only the corresponding group(s) under the target view, producing binary mask and the linked canonical caption from 𝑆. This inference procedure is fully training-free, applies uniformly to both OVS (category-only queries) and RES (attribute/affordance/relation queries), and empirically provides stable matches across scenes and phrasing styles while remaining simple to implement. 8 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Table 2: Quantitative evaluation on the LeRF-OVS subset in terms of mIoU.

Following prior state-of-the-art works [He et al., 2025; Kerr et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024], we evaluate the openvocabulary segmentation (OVS) and referring expression segmentation (RES) performance of our OpenVoxel primarily on subsets of the iPhone Polycam-captured LeRF dataset [Kerr et al., 2023]. For the OVS task, we follow the evaluation protocols in [Ye et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025] using the LeRF-Mask subset, which contains three scenes (ramen, figurines, and teatime) with 6, 7, and 10 queryable objects, respectively. We further conduct experiments on the LeRF-OVS subset [Qin et al., 2024], with the same three scenes with 13, 17, and 12 annotated objects, respectively. For the RES task, we use the Ref-LeRF subset [He et al., 2025], which consists of four scenes (ramen, figurines, teatime, and kitchen) containing 13, 17, 12, and 11 objects, respectively, each paired with sentence-level natural language referring expressions. Implementation details. We conduct our OpenVoxel with PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019] libraries, where our code base is built on top of SVR [Sun et al., 2025]. For the foundation models, we use SAM2 [Ravi et al., 2024] to obtain the per-view segmentation map separately and also prompt SAM2 to conduct the mask merging operation during the Training-Free Sparse Voxel Grouping, as described in Sect. 4.1. On the other hand, the Describe Anything Model(DAM) [Lian et al., 2025] is used as our captioning model. As for the MLLM used to refine the obtained captions/query and conduct the target retrieving, we use Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct [Bai et al., 2023, 2025; Wang et al., 2024]. Please refer to our supplementary material for more implementation details, including engineering tricks and the system prompt we use. 5.2. Quantitative Evaluations Ref-LeRF. We first present the RES results on the Ref-LeRF subset in Table 1, as this task best demonstrates the advantages of our design. Since the official pre-trained models and data of the current state-of-the-art method, ReferSplat [He et al., 2025], do not cover all four scenes, we reproduce its results following the original implementation and configurations, denoted as ReferSplat*. As shown in Table 1, despite OpenVoxel not requiring any descriptionmask annotations during grouping or scene map construction, it achieves notable improvement of 9 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Figure 5: Qualitative results of RES task on the Figurines scene.

During reproduction, we observe that ReferSplats strategy of learning sentence-level embeddings for 3D representations tends to overfit the seen descriptions, resulting in unstable evaluation performance. In contrast, our OpenVoxel consistently achieves higher accuracy, and the superior performance of our text-level retrieval mechanism supports its effectiveness and robustness compared to learned embedding approaches. LeRF-OVS and LeRF-Mask. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the OVS results on the LeRF-OVS and LeRF-Mask subsets, respectively. For LeRF-OVS, we report mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) between predicted and ground-truth masks, following [He et al., 2025; Qin et al., 2024]. For LeRF-Mask, we additionally evaluate mean Balanced IoU (mBIoU), following [Ye et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025]. As shown in Table 2, the OVS task involves relatively simpler queries, leading to higher overall performance across methodseven when evaluated on the same target objects as in Ref-LeRF. For LeRF-Mask, where the queries are fewer and less ambiguous, all current state-of-the-art methods (including ours) achieve over 70% mIoU. Although our design primarily targets the RES setting, OpenVoxel still performs 10 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Figure 6: Qualitative results of RES task on the Ramen scene. competitively on both OVS benchmarks, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness across varying query complexities. 5.3. Qualitative Results We show the qualitative results of figurines and ramen scene in Ref-LeRF subset in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, respectively. In both scenes, ReferSplat often identifies only partial regions of the target object. For example, in Fig 5, when we input the query minimalist style toy with natural grooves next to red apple, ReferSplat focuses on the region near the apple (the apple is at the left of the image), without localizing the correct object. In contrast, OpenVoxel retrieves the toy pumpkin properly and render smooth mask. As for the query drinking utensils with smooth surface near sake bottle in Fig. 6, ReferSplat only focus on the term drinking utensils and incorrectly segments both the glass of water and the sake bottle, while our OpenVoxel locates the sake cup correctly. These results further support our claim of using explicit captions to build scene map and perform text-level retrieval, which benefits the RES tasks. 5.4. Further Analysis Ablation Study. Table 4 shows the ablation studies of our OpenVoxel on the Ref-LeRF subset. Start from the baseline where we do not merge overlapping small masks as described in Sect. 4.1 during the voxel grouping, and also do not canonicalize both the caption and the query. We can see that even with the explicit captioning and text-to-text retrieval, it is still hard to retrieve the correct target due to noisy small groups and misalignment of language format. After that, we include the mask merging strategy in model B, showing slight improvement of 3.7% mIoU due to less noisy groups. Then, in model C, we introduce the canonical captioning for each group while constructing the scene map, showing large improvement of 8.4% mIoU because of more specific captioning (i.e., standard template for each caption and reducing the word object as subject noun). Lastly, our full model canonicalizes the input text query into the same form as the canonical caption, introducing more precise alignment and less ambiguity, and showing the best performance. The above ablation study verifies the necessity of each of our designs.

The term Requires Training here indicates if method needs training to obtain its feature/language field. Although ObjectGS [Zhu et al., 2025] combines the training process of 3DGS and the per-Gaussian object feature (similar to Gaussian Grouping), we note that running vanilla 3DGS on RTX 5090 only takes about 10 minutes, indicating ObjectGS needs an additional 30 minutes to obtain the object feature. On the other hand, although ReferSplat reports that it only takes 58 minutes to train on an A6000 GPU, in all our reproductions, we find that following the official implementation configuration takes at least 2 hours per scene to obtain the best results. In contrast, our OpenVoxel requires only about 3 minutes to complete the voxel grouping and canonical scene map construction, which is at least 10 faster than other SOTAs, and the inference time per query is less than 1 sec. 6. Conclusion In this paper, we propose OpenVoxel, training-free framework for grouping and captioning sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) models. In our Training-Free Voxel Grouping process, we curate group field for pretrained SVR model by matching and merging per-view SAM2 masks. As for the Canonical Scene Map Construction we leverage VLMs and MLLMs to obtain fix form of caption for each constructed group and then collect positions and captions of all groups as the scene map. And finally, we conduct Referring Query Inference to retrieve target objects from our scene map with an input descriptive query. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we verify the efficiency and capability of OpenVoxel. 12 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding"

            "content": "In this supplementary material, we provide additional method details in Sec. and more results of semantic segmentation in Sec. B, ablation studies in Sec. C, visualization in Sec. D. Finally, we discuss about our limitation in Sec. E. A. Details Merging groups. 2 In Sect. 4.1, we mentioned merging small segmentation masks by re-prompting SAM2 [Ravi et al., 2024] to reduce noise. Here, we visualize this process for better understanding. As depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 7, the hand sculpture instance is separated into two different groups in 𝑀 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗 since the SAM2 mask 𝑀1 treats them as two different segment, where one group covers almost the entire hand and the other just representing finger tip. To encourage each of our groups to be more instance-wise, we double-check if any two groups should be merged by prompting all groups that are observable under the current view with SAM2 again. Taking the hand sculpture under view 𝜉2 as example in Fig. 7, we create the point prompts for SAM2 by treating several pixels sampled from the group in 𝑀 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗 of interest as positive prompts, and also select several other 2 groups and treat their center pixel in 𝑀 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗 as negative prompts. As for the mask prompt, we treat the entire group of interest in 𝑀 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗 as positive prompt (mask value: 20), all the other known groups as negative prompt (mask value:20), and the rest of the region is treated as unknown (mask value:0). After using this setting as prompt for SAM2, if the output mask of one group (e.g., the finger tip in Fig. 7) is almost lie inside another groups mask (e.g., over 90% inside the hand sculpture), then we merge the smaller group into the larger group accordingly (i.e., merge the finger tip into the hand sculpture). As shown in our ablation study Table 4, slight improvement is observed by including this merging strategy. 2 MLLM prompt. In Sect. 4.2 and 4.3, we leverage an MLLM model of QWen3-VL-8B to conduct canonical captioning, prompt refinement, and target retrieving. The system prompts are as List 1, List 2, and List 3. We note that we do not spend much effort exploring different kinds of system prompt design. We simply use ChatGPT by describing our task with some examples and ask it to provide system prompts that suit Qwen-VL [Bai et al., 2023, 2025; Wang et al., 2024] models, and the same prompts are shared for both RES and OVS tasks. Therefore, these system prompts may not be the optimal ones, and users still have chance to improve the performance by using our pipeline and simply changing system prompts. Implementation. We now elaborate on the implementation details. Since our method is totally training-free after having the pre-trained SVR model of each scene, reducing the process time of the following processes (i.e., grouping, captioning, and retrieving) is crucial problem. To achieve this goal, we do not always go through all the images from the training set for each scene in practice. Instead, taking the LeRF [Kerr et al., 2023] dataset and corresponding subsets as an example, we uniformly sample the processed views to make sure the total processed view of each scene does not exceed 150. Also, we found that since the merging process requires additional SAM2 execution, conducting this merging process for all views would slow down the inference time. Hence, we conduct the merging (re-prompting SAM2) process for each scene per 1 to 5 steps to speed up the inference. Furthermore, when prompting the captioning model (i.e., DAM [Lian et al., 2025]), we only sample 8 frame-mask pairs (pad to 8 pairs if not enough) for each group to reduce the visual tokens for the model, making sure that the inference is fast. Also, for the usage of MLLM for Canonical Captioning, Query Refinement, and Text-to-text retrieving, we DO NOT provide any visual example for the MLLM as in-context examples 13 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Figure 7: Detail of the mask merging process. since the inference time would be slowed down by doing so (although we acknowledge that conducting these information might bring better performance, we leave this as future direction to explore the balance between adding visual demonstrations and inference time). 1 CANONICAL_CAPTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT= \"\"\"You are detail-focused visual caption 2 refiner for open-vocabulary segmentation and referring grounding. 3 INPUTS 4 - short video where ONE region is masked (highlighted); the outside area 5 is darkened. 6 - rough caption from another model (may be incorrect or misleading). 7 SCOPE 8 - Describe ONLY what lies INSIDE the masked region across frames. 9 - Never name or infer unmasked neighbors as the subject. 10 - Be factual; do not guess hidden details. 11 - If the original caption conflicts with the visual evidence, IGNORE it and 12 correct the errors. 13 REWRITE GOAL 14 Produce precise, natural description with clear class noun and 15 discriminative details that is easy to match with open-vocabulary queries. 16 CORE RULES 17 1) Class noun: Replace vague words (\"object/thing/item/surface\") with 18 concrete class or fine-grained subtype. 19 2) Part-of decision (strict): 21 22 23 24 - Use \"part of <larger object>\" ONLY if ALL are true: a) Visible physical continuity/attachment within the mask (seam/stitch/ joint/hinge/fastener or continuous material/geometry), b) The region is an intrinsic component, c) The larger object's category is visibly identifiable. - Otherwise DO NOT use \"part of\".

B. Semantic Segmentation B.1. Approach Different from OVS and RES, the task of semantic segmentation usually has customized list of class candidates for each dataset. Therefore, instead of retrieving the matched groups for each class, we conduct semantic segmentation for OpenVoxel by choosing the best-matched class for each group. B.2. Dataset and implementation details Dataset. Following OpenGaussian [Wu et al., 2024], we conduct semantic segmentation on 10 different scenes on the Scannet [Dai et al., 2017] dataset. Each scene is represented as colored point clouds, with ground truth images and depth maps provided. Following the official setting, we conduct 19 class semantic segmentation in our experiments. Implementation details. We note that in OpenGaussian, ground truth point clouds are directly utilized as initialization for the 3DGS, and they deactivate all the merging and splitting processes so that perfect geometry alignment is naturally obtained for evaluation. However, it is not easy for our backbone (i.e., SVR [Sun et al., 2025]) to have such an initialization. To have better geometry for the Scannet dataset, we utilize the provided depth map to guide the pre-training process of the SVR model. B.3. Evaluation protocols and results Evaluation protocols. Since we do not use the ground truth points for pre-training the SVR model, the constructed voxel number of each scene is very different from the number of ground truth points. Typically, the number of ground truth point clouds is about 50K to 350K, but the number of our voxels are about 5M to 10M. Therefore, we conduct several different protocols for evaluations to better showcase our OpenVoxel: (1) Nearest,(2) Majority of 25-NN, and (3) Majority of 50-NN. The Nearest protocol means that for each point in the ground truth point cloud, we find the spatially nearest voxel and take the voxels class ID (obtained as described in B.1) as our prediction; Majority of 25-NN and Majority of 50-NN indicates for each point in ground truth, we find 25 or 18 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Table 6: Quantitative evaluation on ScanNet semantic segmentation of 19 classes."

We can see that even without using the ground truth points as prior, our OpenVoxel still outperforms all baselines in terms of mIoU, and is comparable in mAcc. This shows the potential of OpenVoxel on diverse tasks instead of just OVS and RES for being training-free approach. C. Ablation study. Being training-free approach, it is essential to investigate how different prior models affect the performance of our OpenVoxel. Therefore, we conduct ablation studies in three main prior models: the segmentation model for grouping, the captioning model for generating raw captions, the MLLM for canonical captioning, query refinement, and target retrieval. Different segmentation model. Table 7 shows our OpenVoxel using different versions of SAM [Kirillov et al., 2023; Ravi et al., 2024] as segmentation prior model for our grouping stage for RES task. In our experiments, we observe that SAM tends to segment small fragments that are over-detailed, and therefore, the grouping results are slightly noisier than our original version using SAM2. As result, we can see that there is about 10% performance drop on the RES task. Different captioning model. Table 8 shows our OpenVoxel using different captioning model to obtain the original caption for each group on the RES task. For the setting using the Osprey (Yuan, et al, 2024) captioning model, we caption each frame and then ask Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct model to summarize them into one sentence since Osprey is not suitable for taking video as input. As for the setting using Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct as captioning model, we direct bypass the DAM captioning stage and ask Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct to generate caption purely from the visual input (with darkened background and red dot as visual prompt) since it is not trained for taking separated video-mask pair as input. From Table 8 we can see that although Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct is not trained specially for captioning 19 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Table 8: Ablation studies on different models for captioning of RES task on Ref-LeRF [He et al., 2025] subset."

As for Osprey, although it is captioning specialized model, the per-frame prediction property lead to inconsistent caption for the same group from different views, confusing the Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct model for summarization and hindering the performance of the RES task. However, we note that using either captioning model achieves better mIoU than ReferSplat [He et al., 2025] (29.2% for the original reported number and 24.5% for our reproduced results) on the RES task, showing the robustness of our designed pipeline. Different MLLM. Table 9 shows the results of our OpenVoxel using different MLLMs during the canonical scene map construction and the inference stage with the totally same system prompts and user prompts. Since we do not specially design different prompt for each model, we observe that the Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct is incapable of canonicalize the captions generated from DAM. Instead, it tends to repeat some of the words in the original caption as the refined caption. As result, the incorrect refined captions are hard for the Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct model to locate the correct target object in the inference stage, leading to catastrophic 9.98% mIoU. In contrast, the newest and largest model for this ablation, Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct is obviously performing best. D. Qualitative results Referring Segmentation. We provide the qualitative results of the other two scenes (i.e., teatime and kitchen) in Ref-LeRF [He et al., 2025] subset for RES task in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. Similar to our observation in Sect. 5.3, for the first column (i.e., smooth container placed next to the sheep doll, near the apple as query) in Fig. 8, ReferSplat [He et al., 2025] tends to capture only part of the query (i.e., container) and hence segmenting both the coffe mug and the glass of tea, neglecting other spatial clues in the query. Similarly, for the last column in Fig. 9 with countertop with vibrant yellow color provides plenty of space for preparing cooking ingredients. as query, ReferSplat only capture the color information of vibrant yellow and segment both the counter top and the wall. In contrast, our OpenVoxel successfully locates the ideal target in both cases. We additionally showcase the qualitative results of RES on the Teatime scene using our created natural language that are not included in the Ref-LeRF subset as query to demonstrate the capability of our OpenVoxel compared with ReferSplat [He et al., 2025]. We can see that since ReferSplat requires training on all objects using human annotated sentences, it is not able to locate objects that are not annotated during their training. 20 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Figure 8: Qualitative results of RES task on the Teatime scene. Figure 9: Qualitative results of RES task on the Kitchen scene. In contrast, our training-free approach is not depending on the training annotations at all and is able to locate the correct targets. We note that for the last two columns where the input query contains view dependent descriptions, although our OpenVoxel retrieve two targets instead of the only one matched, the results are still including the correct target, showing the potential capability of solving view-specific tasks. E. Discussions and Limitations. We now discuss the potential limitation of our OpenVoxel. As training-free approach, the grouping process of OpenVoxel is relatively sensitive to parameters comparing to the end-to-end generalizable ones [Chou et al., 21 OpenVoxel : Training-Free Grouping and Captioning Voxels for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding Figure 10: Qualitative results of RES task on the Teatime scene with other queries. Note that these queries are created additionally and all of them are not appeared in the original annotations from Ref-LeRF subset (so there are no ground truth mask for them). We can see that ReferSplat [He et al., 2025] struggles to recognize unseen target objects even in the same scene it is optimized, showing that it tends to overfit on annotated objects from the dataset. 2024]. As described in Sect. A, the sampling rate of frames and merging frequency are customized for each scene. And since how well-separated for different instances largely affects the performance for both OVS and RES (semantic segmentation is less affected), the SAM2 parameters are needed to be adjust carefully. However, we note that other optimization-based grouping methods [Ye et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025] also share similar limitation, as their results heavily rely on the quality of view-consistent video segmentation models such as DEVA [Cheng et al., 2023]. Fortunately, our heuristic of sampling one frame per 3-5 frames and conduct merging once per 3 steps generally work well. In case the result is unsatisfactory, our work is totally training-free so it would be easy to adjust the parameters and re-run the grouping process with tolerable time (about 1 minute per-scene, taking Ref-LeRF subset as example.) Also, since we conduct the instance-level grouping process before captioning/retrieval, if the user gives query to indicate some part of larger object (e.g., flash light of the camera in Fig. 5), our OpenVoxel would still segment the whole object (i.e., the whole camera) since the small parts of the same object is bundled together. One possible solution to solve this issue is to curate the groups as small as possible while still keeping them semantically reasonable (requires 2D segmentation maps that includes those small part). Additionally, instead of just build the Scene Map 𝑆 by storing center locations of each group, construct complex scene graph for all the groups to indicate the spatial relations (e.g., on top of, between) or ownership (e.g., belongs to, part of) explicitly. We truly believes that this would help improving the performance and robustness of our OpenVoxel and leave it as possible future direction. Another limitation of our OpenVoxel lies in the usage of MLLM models. As shown in the Sect. A, we turn off the chain-of-thought process of the MLLM model for fast inference (less than one second per query). However, by doing so the capability of reasoning for the MLLM is also limited, and hence both the canonicalized captions and the retrieving process are having room to be improved. Also, as shown in Table 9, the results of using different open-source MLLM differs. We believe that if better open-source MLLM appear with faster thinking/reasoning ability, our OpenVoxel can be benefited from them.
