For an autonomous vehicle (AV) to operate safely and effectively, it must have comprehensive understanding of its environment and the evolution thereof. In doing so, the AV *Denotes equal contribution. Figure 1. GASP learns structured, generalizable representation of the environment and its evolution and can be further trained to perform well on downstream AD tasks. We outperform SotA pretraining UnO [2] across the board, especially on primarily semantic tasks like map segmentation. No pre-training is displayed for reference. Downstream tasks requiring additional labels are posttrained using 1000 samples (1% of pre-training scale). must learn to reason about geometry and semantics in dynamic environment. To develop comprehensive understanding of the environment, most existing systems rely heavily on large datasets with human-labeled annotations. Annotations are essential for solving tasks such as object detection and forecasting [26, 61], online mapping [33], and to enable multitask frameworks with ego trajectory planning [13, 24, 25]. Unlabeled data is typically abundant when developing AD systems, but annotating sufficiently diverse dataset is prohibitively expensive, limiting scalability of annotation reliant methods. In other domains, e.g., natural language processing, selfsupervised predictive learning over large datasets has been highly successful [9, 15, 43]. Researchers have explored predictive learning for AD, e.g. by predicting future point clouds [27, 60], occupancy [24, 64], or video [58]. These methods have shown promise but may struggle to model the continuous and dynamic nature of the driving environment, as they focus on predicting sensor observations rather than the underlying structure of the world. Recent works [1, 2] address this by learning representation in continuous spacetime. By predicting future occupancy from past lidar data, these methods offer more accurate model of the inherently continuous real world. However, while future occupancy prediction provides strong geometric and temporal cues, it lacks the semantic richness needed comprehensive scene understanding and complex reasoning in downstream tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose GASP, selfsupervised pre-training method that integrates multiple sources of readily available signals in AV development: Future lidar scans, camera images, and ego poses. By leveraging supervision from diverse sensor modalities, our method results in richer representation of the environment and improves geometric, temporal, and semantic understanding. Specifically, GASP learns to predict occupancy, ego-path, and features from vision foundation model (VFM) in continuous 4D (3D + time) representation. The learned representation is useful on an array of downstream AD tasks, outperforming prior works as illustrated in Fig. 1. Additionally, we introduce and demonstrate the efficacy of practical improvements: 1) harvesting, negative information [31], from missing lidar rays for additional supervision, and 2) rotation augmentation strategy that significantly improves model generalization. Our main contributions are: Propose self-supervised pre-training method, GASP, designed to learn structured, generalizable 4D representation in continuous time by integrating geometric, temporal, and semantic supervision from multiple readily available signals. Demonstrate that GASPpre-training leads to improved generalization across multiple downstream autonomous driving tasks, significantly outperforming uni-modal pretraining on tasks such as semantic occupancy forecasting, online mapping, and ego-trajectory prediction. Provide open-source code, including custom CUDA kernels for accelerated query generation and reimplementation of previously closed-source baselines, to facilitate further research in self-supervised learning for AD. 2. Related work Self-supervised learning has gained traction due to its ability to capture meaningful patterns without requiring expensive labels [12, 39, 45], enabling greater scalability. We apply these ideas to AD and provide an overview of the most relevant developments. Generative methods: Generative methods withhold or alter parts of an input data sample and aim to reconstruct this part from the remaining data. Such methods learn features that generalize across multitude of tasks. Masked input models have been applied to text [8, 15, 44], images [5, 6, 16, 19, 42], videos [50] and point clouds [20, 37, 41, 62]. These methods have been tailored to AD by jointly encoding multiple sensors and recovering masked inputs by neural rendering techniques [56, 63]. Predicting future raw sensory data, such as point cloud forecasting [27, 60] and video frame forecasting [58], as pre-training step can also be seen in the light of masked input modeling. While such models learn relevant patterns in the data, they are also forced to learn details that are irrelevant for AD tasks: sensor intrinsics such as the scan pattern of lidar, and lowlevel stochastic information such as the lighting of each reconstructed pixel. Implicit generative methods: Alternatively, sensory data forecasting can be rephrased as generic occupancy forecasting [2]. This has two advantages compared to direct generative methods: Future occupancy depends on the dynamics of the environment but not on that of the sensors, and occupancy is directly useful for downstream tasks in AD. By encoding past sensory information (e.g., lidar [1, 2, 27, 64] or images [38, 60]) into latent representation they reason about the future at discrete [22, 24, 27, 64] or continuous [1, 2] times. We follow this trend, taking inspiration from [2], to implicitly predict 4D continuous occupancy field that can be queried at 4D coordinates = (x, y, z, t) to yield local occupancy probability. Our method predicts continuous occupancy field, but extends this by implicitly predicting both the future path of the ego vehicle and the flow of rich latent representation in unified way. Embedded predictions: By operating directly in the domain of abstract representations, unimportant and noisy low-level details can be ignored. Methods in this category often rely on contrastive learning [14] or feature alignment between augmented views of the same input, as done in DINO [12, 39]. An alternative is to use latent information to reconstruct missing parts of the input, which has shown promising results for images [4] and videos [7]. Building on these ideas, we encourage our model to implicitly predict high-level abstract features in the future, forcing it to reason about semantics and dynamics. Rather than training new image encoder, we distill features generated by DINOv2 [39], model pre-trained on large-scale dataset to produce generalizable image representations. Trajectory planning: Predicting desirable future trajectory is the ultimate goal of an AV. Contemporary methods typically follow an end-to-end design, where intermediate outputs contribute to predicting final drivable trajectory [13, 24, 25, 32, 49, 52]. This structured approach improves ego trajectory forecasting and increases perforFigure 2. Overview of GASP. Past lidar scans are encoded into BEV feature map. These features are used by implicit decoders to predict DINOv2 features ˆD, occupancy ˆO, and ego-path ˆE at the query points generated from future sensor data during pre-training. We also show that the learned representation is useful when transferred to an array of downstream AD tasks. mance on intermediate tasks, but also relies on expensive labeled data [24]. Trajectory prediction itself is rich self-supervised signal that requires no human annotations. Therefore, we incorporate ego-path prediction as pretraining task to integrate end-to-end path prediction with future occupancy and semantic feature information, providing richer understanding of driving scenes. Lifting vision foundation models to 3D: Several works have explored lifting image features to 3D. Lifting CLIP features into 3D [21, 51] can enhance semantic understanding, while [40] combine CLIP and SAM [30] for textpromptable point cloud segmentation. These approaches rely on full feature dimensionality, while [57] demonstrate that subset of DINOv2 features is sufficient to improve semantic understanding and enable few-shot auto-labeling in scene reconstruction. With this insight, we distill positional embedding-denoised DINOv2 features [59]. key distinction is that we predict these features future evolution, capturing the representations temporal dynamics. 3. Method We propose GASP, self-supervised method that trains model to reason about the evolution of geometry and semantics in temporal data. The model is trained to predict future occupancy (geometry and time), vision foundation model (VFM) features (semantics and time), and ego-path (geometry and semantics) at any queried point in continuous spacetime. We outline the model architecture in Sec. 3.1 and Fig. 2, explain the pre-training procedure in Sec. 3.2, and how to enhance the models usability by leveraging labeled data with post-training in Sec. 3.3. 3.1. Model architecture We adopt the model architecture in [1, 2]. The model uses lidar encoder to parametrize feature field conditioned on past sensor data that can be queried for occupancy through lightweight implicit decoder. In addition to that, we add additional decoders to predict VFM features, and ego-vehicle occupancy at any 4D point, see Fig. 2. We follow [2] and use temporal lidar data as input in this work, but note that the decoding architecture is sensor-agnostic. The lidar encoder processes Kpast past lidar scans into birds-eye-view (BEV) feature map RHW C. Scans are aggregated with ego-motion compensation and voxelized [55] before being encoded by ResNet-style [18] backbone with deformable attention [65] and Feature Pyramid Network [35]. The decoders query the BEV feature map to predict target values through lightweight architecture based on deformable attention [65], residual blocks, and final linear layer. This design enables efficient parallel query decoding, while doing the heavy lifting in the encoder. We use the same architecture for all decoders heads to, for each query point qi predict occupancy ˆoi = Ho(qi), VFM feature ˆvi = Hv(qi), and ego path query ˆei = He(qi). 3.2. Pre-training procedure For our self-supervised pre-training, we generalize the approach of [2] and produce set of 4D (3D + time) data samples = {qi, ai}N i=0 comprising of queries qi and targets ai from future data at [0, Tmax]. We assume temporal sequences of lidar data with known egovehicle motion throughout the sequence, standard in AD datasets [3, 10, 11, 46, 53, 54]. We denote the set of lidar points with their corresponding sensor origin = {pi, si}M i=1, where each lidar point pi = (xi, yi, zi) and si = (xi, yi, zi) has corresponding time ti at which the ray was emitted. We extend the geometric occupancy supervision, using data samples DO, with vision foundation model feature supervision from DF and future ego path traversal probabilities using DE. We elaborate on the training procedure below. Occupancy data generation: We follow the methodology of [2] to create training samples for future occupancy prediction. Unoccupied query points are sampled along the lidar ray up to the lidar return: = {si + r(pi si), 0 (0, 1)}N i=0 (1) Positive, occupied, queries are generated within buffer zone with length δ behind the lidar return D+ = {pi + r(pi si) pi si , 1 (0, δ)}N i=0 (2) and from D+ and respectively to form the data samples DO to supervise In practice, we randomly select + future occupancy. Vision foundation model data generation: To generate training samples DF for learning temporal semantic features, we project future lidar points to the images closest in time, while compensating for ego-motion, and fetch the corresponding feature. Since the lidar is typically mounted higher than the camera, its rays can pass over objects such as vehicles and hit the ground or other surfaces behind them. Naively projecting onto the image, these may be assigned incorrect semantic features, leading to noisy supervision. We therefore apply per-pixel min-depth filtering, ensuring that only the closest visible points, Pvis P, contribute to training. At the projected locations, we extract the feature Fi from the output of frozen vision foundation model as the semantic training target: r(pi si) pi si DF = {pi + , Fi (0, δ), pi, si Pvis} (3) In this work, we chose to use the denoising DINOv2 model [59] to mitigate known issues in lifting DINOv2 features with positional encodings [57]. However, we note that features from any vision foundation model could be used. The proposed procedure lifts information present in DINOv2 features from 2D to 3D, allowing for joint spatial and semantic reasoning. Ego path data generation: We generate ego path training samples from the future poses of the ego vehicle = {ei = (xi, yi, zi)}M i=1, from which we define the set of positive = {q ei wego}M queries Q+ i=1, as points closer than, wego, to the vehicle. This gives us the positive data samples D+ = {q, 1 Q+ E} Negative samples are instead located in the rest of the space within the region of interest RI : (4) = {q, 0 RI Q+ E} (5) We emphasize the distinction between ego-path and egotrajectory. The former has no notion of time, only positions. Focusing solely on the driven path avoids ambiguity that occurs when the ego-vehicle is stationary. The full positive sampling volume could technically be valid path for the ego-vehicle to traverse. However, directly predicting it forces the model to learn an explicit multi-modal distribution of possible ego-paths. Our formulation allows the task to be solved within our unified framework, alongside the prediction of evolving occupancy and semantic features. Training loss: We train our model using multi-task loss that consists of binary cross-entropy terms for occupancy Locc and ego-path probabilities Lego, and L1-loss for DINOv2 features Ldino. The total loss is defined as: = λoccLocc + λdinoLdino + λegoLego, (6) where λocc, λdino, and λego are hyperparameters. Rotation augmentation: Real-world driving is inherently dominated by straight-road driving, where the motion of most road participants is axis-aligned with the ego coordinate system. This has been shown to induce strong bias in e.g. online mapping [36]. We observed similar tendencies in the initial training of GASP and address this by randomly rotating the coordinate system by θ [θmin, θmax] during training. This reduces the directional bias and promotes more diverse representation of motion. Missing lidar ray inference: lidar is an active sensor that measures distances by emitting laser rays. Unobstructed rays do not return measurements (a.k.a. missing). Disregarded in most applications and datasets [3, 10, 11, 46, 53, 54], missing rays carry valuable information about unoccupied space. Following [48], where the utility of missing rays for learning scene geometry was demonstrated, we infer missing rays from lidar scans and leverage them to sample negative occupancy queries. Recovering individual missing rays is prone to false positives. To increase robustness, we adapt the algorithm to focus on identifying extended regions of missing rays. 3.3. Post-training procedure GASP aims to equip the model with strong understanding of geometry, semantics, and dynamics. To assess the quality of the learned representations, we adapt the model or introduce additional task-specific heads during post-training (see Fig. 2). The learned representation can be used in multiple ways: querying it similarly to the pre-training phase, or using directly (or resampled) as input to another network. This flexibility enables the straightforward addition of task-specific heads for variety of downstream applications. 4. Experiments In this section, we evaluate the proposed self-supervised objective and assess whether the model learns generalizable representation of the environment and its evolution. First, we evaluate the performance of the pre-trained model on Geometric 4D Occupancy Forecasting (Sec. 4.2). The pre-trained models generalization capabilities are evaluated on downstream AD tasks: Semantic BEV Forecasting (Sec. 4.3), Map Segmentation (Sec. 4.4), and Ego Trajectory Forecasting (Sec. 4.5). We study two settings: 1) Figure 3. Predicted occupancy (colored by depth and height respectively) and DINOv2 features (mapped to RGB using the three most important features) projected into camera views, as well as holistic view from slightly above and behind the ego vehicle. Different type of objects such as road, vehicles, buildings, and trees have different features, indicating the model has semantic understanding of the objects in the scene. The injected white box represents the ego vehicle for clarity. Feature evaluation ( ); We freeze the learned encoder and train only the head. This allows us to measure how relevant the information encoded in the BEV features is. 2) Full network adaptation ( ); We train both the encoder and heads. This helps us assess how well the pre-trained model serves as starting point for downstream tasks. Last, we ablate the importance of different components of our pre-training strategy in Sec. 4.6 and verify that downstream performance scales with the amount of unlabeled data in Sec. 4.7. improvements, such as better schedule, rotation augmentation, and missing ray supervision, boost performance beyond the originally reported numbers. For fair comparison, we use our improved UnO as the baseline in all experiments.See Appendix for more details. We evaluate performance using different amounts of labeled samples [1, 105]. For low amounts of labeled data (n 102), we observe significant variance in performance depending on the samples used during training. Therefore, we train with 10 different random seeds and report the mean and standard deviation of the evaluation results. At larger sample sizes (n 103), the variance is negligible. = and Unless specified otherwise, the point cloud input range is x, 70m and [2, 6] with pillar size of 0.16 0.16 m2. We use Kpast = 3 lidar scans at an interval of 0.5 s. We train for 100, 000 steps with the Adam optimizer [28], cosine annealing learning rate schedule with maximum learning rate of 4 104 warming up for 2000 steps, and an effective batch size of 8. We follow [2] and use buffer size of δ = 0.1 for positive occupancy and DINOv2 queries. For each training sample, + = 0.9M queries are used from D+ respectively. DINOv2 features are reduced to their = 16 principal components, determined on randomly sampled subset of the training data. The features are cached for each image prior to training. Each sample uses NF = 100k queries from DF . For ego path we use buffers wego = 1m and sample + . Rotation augmentations are sampled from θ U(20, 20). The loss weights are set to λocc = 1.0, λdino = 0.5, and λego = 0.1. We train and evaluate our model using the Argoverse 2 [53] dataset. For online mapping, results are based on preand post-training on the geographically disjoint splits proposed in [34] while other tasks use the original training and validation splits. = 10k queries from D+ and = Figure 4. Predicted future VLM features from Birds Eye View. The model correctly predicts the car taking right turn as well as those going straight through the crossing. 4.1. Experimental setup and implementation details We reimplement UnO [2] as the baseline for our experiments. To verify the correctness of our implementation, we train and evaluate the model using the training schedule and evaluation protocol reported in the paper, and achieve performance on par with the published results.

Geometric 4D occupancy forecasting To evaluate the pre-trained models geometric understanding, we follow [2] and assess its 4D occupancy forecasting performance. The task is to predict the occupancy of 3D coordinates at future time steps, without any finetuning. For fair comparison and eliminating the need for manual threshold tuning, we measure recall at fixed precision of 70%. Predictions are obtained by querying the model over spatial region of 80 80 m2 around the ego vehicle, with uniform sampling interval of 0.2 in all spatial directions. Temporally, we evaluate at {0.6, 1.2, ..., 3.0} into the future. Following [2], we compute precision using lidar-based ray tracing [23] classifying voxels of size 0.2 m3 as free if traversed by lidar beam before the measured point. Annotated bounding boxes are used to identify points corresponding to objects, labeling them as occupied. Results: Comparing GASP with UnO in Tab. 2 shows that the 4D-occupancy recall at precision 70 (R@P70) increases from 79.4% to 81.9%. The performance increase primarily stems from the addition of DINOv2 supervision. Ego path supervision seems to slightly decrease the geometric performance. Intuitively, predicting the future ego path does not require full understanding of scene geometry. Qualitatively, Fig. 3 exemplifies the geometric and semantic capabilities of the learned representation at the current timestep, whereas Fig. 4 highlights predictions in to the future. 4.3. Semantic BEV forecasting In Semantic BEV forecasting [2] the model is tasked with forecasting semantic labels and occupancy of 2D coordinates aligned with the ground plane. We adapt the pretrained occupancy decoder (see Sec. 3.1) to instead predict the occupancy for each class separately. Following standard protocol [1, 2], we evaluate occupancy for the vehicle class at discrete future times = {0.0 s, 0.5 s, ..., 3.0 s} in uniform grid 80 80 m2 centered around the ego-vehicle with spatial resolution of 0.4 m. We measure performance by Average Precision (AP) and Soft-IoU computed across all queries in space and time. Figure 7. Ego path in crossing, colored by distance to egovehicle. Lidar point cloud (grey) and true ego path (dashed line) are displayed for reference. At time t0 GASP predicts multiple possible modes (A, B), and once it is no longer probable to continue towards (at t+), the predictions collapse to only one mode. Results: We compare our model to the state-of-the-art [1, 2, 13]. In Fig. 5, we show the performance of GASP and the UnO baseline for different amounts of labeled samples. GASP consistently outperforms the UnO baseline across all amounts of training samples, demonstrating that the learned representation is more informative for forecasting. This holds especially true for low amounts of labeled data where GASP requires one order of magnitude less data than UnO to reach the same performance. The gap decreases notably with the amount of labeled samples when the encoder is unfrozen, which is expected given that both models share the same architecture. Performance measured in terms of SoftIoU follows the same trend, see Appendix B.1. 4.4. Map segmentation To assess the semantic content learned from the proposed pre-training scheme, we evaluate its performance on map segmentation. The task consists of classifying cells in rasterized grid as lane dividers, road boundaries, or pedestrian crossings, which we predict using lightweight UNet-inspired decoder [17] on top of Z. We consider an 80 80 m2 region around the ego vehicle with cell size of 30 cm. We report the mean intersection over union (mIoU) as the evaluation metric. Enc.

Ego-trajectory prediction the full Argoverse 2 sensor dataset, using frozen ( ) and unfrozen ( ) encoders. Results: While lidar-only map segmentation is underexplored, we note that GASP outperforms SotA camera-only setups [34]. As shown in Fig. 6a, when freezing the encoder and training only the map segmentation head, GASP consistently outperforms the baseline across all training set sizes. Our method reaches saturation at 104 training samples, indicating that it learned highly generalizable features. The trend persists when unfreezing the encoder, shown in Fig. 6b. The results suggest that our pre-trained model captures essential features for online mapping, even pedestrian crossings, despite never being trained to detect them. The performance gap between the frozen and unfrozen models at 105 training samples is only 5 mIoU, highlighting that much of the necessary information for map segmentation is encoded during pre-training. For exact metrics, see Appendix B.2. 4.5. Ego-trajectory prediction To evaluate the models understanding of the ego vehicles future trajectory under our proposed pre-training scheme, we start by inspecting its predicted paths. In Fig. 7 the model proposes multiple plausible modes, indicating an awareness of multi-modal future motion and drivable areas. To further assess its learned motion understanding in structured geometric representation, including velocity, we employ simple trajectory decoder as post-training step. The decoder aggregates information from the feature map, Z, via deformable attention [65] into latent template trajectories that are later decoded into 2D coordinates with an MLP. It is trained with an imitation-learning objective between the predicted and recorded trajectory. Results: In Tab. 1 we report minADE1&6, and minFDE1&6, standard metrics for motion forecasting in Argoverse. These metrics are analogous to L2-planning metrics reported in end-to-end driving works [24, 52], whilst still allowing for multiple trajectory proposals. The results show that GASP captures future ego motion better than UnO in both settings, and significantly outperforms training from scratch, despite using the full amount of trajectory labels.

Ablation over the pre-training components of GASP . We show performance directly obtained from pre-training (4D occ. P@R70) and its generalization to downstream tasks (Semantic BEV Forecasting and Map Segmentation) when finetuned on different amounts of labeled samples. We ablate each component added to UnO with the sensor encoder frozen ( ) and unfrozen ( ) as well as performance with no pre-training . 4.6. Ablations To understand the key contributors to our pre-training strategy, we systematically ablate its components and analyze their individual impact. See Appendix for details. Loss terms: We introduce different loss terms incrementally and measure their effect on final performance. The results, summarized in Tab. 2, highlight the relative contribution of each term and show significant boost when combined. Rotation augmentation: We vary the maximum rotation angle for data augmentation to determine its influence on model robustness. The results are presented in Tab. 3. This augmentation yields significant and consistent improvements for both UnO and GASP between 5 and 45. We opt to use 20 as default. Additionally, we investigate the effect of translation and jitter augmentations, which do not yield meaningful improvements, see Appendix C.3. Missing rays: We examine the effect of adding supervision for missing lidar rays. Quantitative results in Appendix C.2, do not show significant impact, as the effect of missing rays is not explicitly captured by the current metrics. However, the primary benefit is visually apparent in Fig. 8. Missing ray supervision reduces prediction noise in regions with sparse supervision, such as near region-of-interest boundaries or towards an unobstructed horizon. Additionally, we note reduction in occupancy halos above vehicles, which were reported as failure case in previous work [2]. DINOv2 components: To evaluate the role of DINOv2 features, we alter the number of components (8, 16, and 32) and observe the impact on performance. We conclude that learning to predict the 16 most important components yields good results across all three tasks with the full results reported in Appendix C.1.

Scaling pre-training One of the most important qualities of self-supervision is that it continues to show benefits when applied to huge amounts of data. To demonstrate this, we train GASP on varying number of pre-training samples and evaluate on 4D-occupancy and fine-tuned semantic forecasting (on 1k labeled samples with frozen encoder). Here, we opt to use the Zenseact Open Dataset (ZOD) [3] to study the scaling behaviour beyond the 100k training samples available in Argoverse 2 Sensor [53]. The results in Fig. 9 show that our method scales predictably with no sign of saturation, even when trained on the combined Frames, Sequences, and Drives of ZOD. Furthermore, this experiment shows that GASP is dataset-agnostic. The generally lower scores are expected as ZOD has greater focus on highway driving with higher average velocities than the predominantly inner city driving in AV2. 5. Conclusion Autonomous driving (AD) generates vast amounts of spatiotemporal data, alluding to the possibility of harnessing scale to learn the underlying geometric and semantic structure of the environment and its evolution over time. To this end, we introduce GASP, self-supervised pre-training strategy that enables scalable representation learning for AD using geometric, semantic, and temporal supervision signals. Conditioned on past sensory input, GASP is supervised to predict 1) future occupancy, 2) features from Figure 9. Scaling properties. We vary the number of pre-training samples and evaluate performance (red ) and generalization (blue ), demonstrating GASPs remarkably predictable, logarithmic, scaling behavior. vision foundation model, and 3) ego-path traversal probability at any continuous point = (x, y, z, t) in spacetime. In doing so, GASP learns rich and generalizable representation of the environment that can be used directly or finetuned for variety of downstream tasks. We demonstrate that our pre-training strategy greatly improves the generalization on tasks such as semantic forecasting, online mapping, and ego-motion forecasting when compared to strategies that only utilize geometric and temporal supervision. Our results suggest that GASP is promising approach for learning sensor agnostic and generalizable representations for autonomous driving in scalable manner. We release the code to support further research in this area."

            "content": "While we only use GASP to pre-train lidar-based model, the approach is directly applicable to any BEV model, making setups with alternative sensors or complementary multi-modal configurations promising direction for future work. Furthermore, leveraging other foundation models (e.g. CLIP [45], SAM [29], or SAL [40]) or tapping in to other sources of self-supervision (e.g. flow-consistency) could further enrich the learned representations. Finally, while GASP shows powerful scaling properties, under the current trend we would require roughly 300,000 years of driving to reach near-perfect 4D occupancy prediction highlighting the need for further improvements in pretraining efficiency."

Missing rays Here, we ablate the use of inferred missing rays during pretraining. We measure performance on geometric 4D occupancy using the recall at precision 70% and report the numbers in Tab. 11. As noted in the main manuscript, we do not see any quantitative improvements, but rather qualitative ones. We hypothesize that this is because the metric inherently disregards the regions where this supervision helps. Missing rays GASP 81.6 81.0 displayed the recall at precision 70%. We dont see any major improvements using this augmentation and opt to use the more impactful rotation augmentation. We hypothesize that the data already includes large variety of lateral and longitudinal shifts. PT"

Recall at precision 70% Jitter augmentation: We also experiment with jitter augmentation, which aims to up-sample negative queries close to the positive queries by adding jitter parameter τ to the negative query equation: = oi + (pi oi)dτ (7) where U(0, 1). Our initial intuitionthat increasing jitter would lead to sharper geometry learningdid not hold, as performance declines with higher jitter values. Conversely, reducing jitter also appears to negatively impact model performance. PT 0. 0.8 1.0 1.2 2.0 3.0 Jitter GASP 80.0 80.1 81.6 80.7 75. 68.5 Table 14. Jitter. Recall at precision 70% Table 11.

Augmentation In addition to the rotation augmentation outlined in the main manuscript, we also experiment with translation, jitter augmentations, and the number of feature dimensions in the DINOv2 features. We measure geometric 4D occupancy performance as measured by the recall at precision 70%. Rotation augmentation: For completeness, we, apart from GASP, also show that UnO benefits from rotation augmentation in Tab. 12. Translation augmentation: Similarly to the rotation augmentation, we can augment the training data such that the vehicle is translated in and directions. We ablate the effects of adding such translation augmentation, and Tab. We ablate the loss function used to learn our DINOv2 features in Tab. 15. We again compare performance on geometric 4D occupancy using the recall at precision 70% metric. The Smooth-L1 loss reduces the performance and we opt to use the L1-loss.

Additional visualizations We provide some additional qualitative results in Figs. 11 to 18. In short, they aim to give more examples of the quality of the information that the representation embeds, but also to depict some interesting emergent properties of our pre-training strategy. In Fig. 11 one can view the full holistic view of both semantic and occupancy-field information, as opposed to in Fig. 3, and in Fig. 12 birds-eye view of point-cloud inputs, features, and occupancy, is provided. Furthermore, in Fig. 13, the multimodal outputs on path probabilities in three-way intersection are depicted. For the BEV semantic forecasting task, Sec. 4.3, complementary qualitative results are provided in Fig. 14 for three scenes, common case, case with unusual objects, and more complex case. In Fig. 15, outputs from the map segmentation task are given for different number of samples in the training set given frozen GASP encoder. Here, we may visually make note of the models ability to predict pedestrian crossings, as indicated in Sec. 4.4, despite the absence of this information in the Lidar input data. Qualitative results connected to the ego-trajectory prediction task can be viewed in Fig. 16. In Fig. 17 we note the similarity between the predicted semantic regions of, what could possibly be understood as, drivable area with the predicted ego future path. Potentially, their joint supervision signal amplifies tasks directly dependent on this type of information, such as map segmentation, which could explain why having both, and not one or the other, seems beneficial for said task. Finally, in Fig. 18, we show that feature prediction in GASP has the potential of capturing fine-grained, yet important, scene details to an extent that its geometric occupancy head, and by extension model which only models geometric occupancy, hardly highlights.
