            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of natural language processing, delivering remarkable performance in diverse applications, including multilingual translation (Team et al., 2022), medical diagnostics (Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023), tool-augmented reasoning (Schick et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023), and conversational assistance (Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023). As LLMs increasingly support safety-critical domains such as healthcare (Singhal et al., 2022) and legal advisory 1Source: redeval https://github.com/knoveleng/ 1 systems (Maddela et al., 2023), their robustness against adversarial inputs has become critical concern. Adversarial prompts - carefully designed inputs crafted to exploit model vulnerabilities and elicit unsafe, biased, or erroneous responses - pose significant risks to the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs (Perez et al., 2022b; Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). Addressing these vulnerabilities is both technical necessity and an ethical imperative to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of LLMs in real-world settings (Anwar et al., 2024; Hendrycks et al., 2022). Despite the growing availability of datasets that aim to investigate LLM vulnerabilities, such as AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), and Do-Not-Answer (Wang et al., 2024b), significant challenges remain. Existing datasets often adopt inconsistent definitions of risk categories, vary in scope and format, and lack comprehensive coverage of specific domains or use cases. For example, some datasets focus narrowly on toxicity or bias, while others emphasize jailbreaking techniques, resulting in fragmented evaluation frameworks. This inconsistency raises critical research question: Why is there no universal dataset that provides consistent risk categorization and comprehensive evaluation in diverse domains? Furthermore, related question emerges: Which risk categories and domains do existing datasets prioritize and how align with real-world LLM deployment scenarios? Furthermore, prior red-teaming methods, including approaches such as RainbowPlus (Dang et al., 2025), AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2024, 2025), Tree-of-Attacks (Mehrotra et al., 2023), and GPTFuzzer (Yu et al., 2023), have primarily evaluated older LLM architectures. These studies often lack comparisons with recently released state-of-the-art models such as Qwen2.5 (Yang et al., 2024; Team, 2024c), Llama 3.1 (Team, 2024b), and Gemma 2 (Team, 2024a). This gap prompts another key research question: How do modern LLMs perform under red teaming evaluations and what new insights can be gained from benchmarking their robustness? To address these research questions, we introduce RedBench, novel universal dataset designed to advance red teaming for LLM. RedBench aggregates and harmonizes 37 existing datasets from leading conferences and influential papers, providing standardized framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities. By systematically analyzing the risk categories and domains covered by these datasets, RedBench offers comprehensive overview of the current landscape of red teaming resources. Furthermore, we select targeted subdatasets from RedBench to establish baselines for modern LLMs, enabling robust comparisons and fostering future research. To ensure accessibility and reproducibility, we open-source both the RedBench dataset and the associated evaluation code. Our study makes the following contributions: RedBench Dataset: universal dataset that consolidates 37 existing red teaming datasets, providing consistent risk categorization and comprehensive coverage of domains to enable standardized LLM evaluations. Comprehensive Analysis: detailed analysis of risk categories and domains in existing datasets, highlighting gaps and opportunities for future red-teaming research. Baselines for Modern LLMs: Evaluation baselines for state-of-the-art LLMs, including Qwen2.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemma2, to assess their robustness against adversarial prompts and foster comparative studies. Open-Source Resources: Publicly available dataset and evaluation code to promote transparency, reproducibility, and communitydriven advances in LLM red-teaming."

            "title": "2.1 Data Collection",
            "content": "To construct RedBench, high-quality and comprehensive dataset for red teaming large language models (LLMs), we aggregated 37 benchmark datasets sourced from leading peer-reviewed conferences, journals, and repositories. These sources include prominent venues such as the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), and the preprint repository arXiv, among others. The selection criteria prioritized peer-reviewed status, relevance to red teaming objectives, and coverage of diverse risk scenarios, ensuring robust and representative foundation for universal red-teaming dataset. The resulting corpus comprises 29,362 samples, covering wide range of prompt types designed to probe LLM vulnerabilities. These samples are categorized into two primary red teaming directions: Attack: This direction evaluates the susceptibility of the model to harmful or adversarial prompts that aim to elicit unsafe, biased, or erroneous responses (Dang et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025). Of the 37 datasets, 33 focus on this direction, including well-known benchmarks such as HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), and DAN (Shen et al., 2024a). These datasets contain instructions designed to exploit vulnerabilities in areas such as toxicity, misinformation, and jailbreaking. Refusal: This direction assesses the models tendency to over-defend by refusing benign or legitimate prompts, which can hinder usability (Brahman et al., 2024; Cui et al., 2024). Four datasets address this direction: CoCoNot (Brahman et al., 2024), ORBench (Cui et al., 2024), SGXTest (Gupta et al., 2024) and XSTest (Röttger et al., 2024). These datasets include prompts designed to test the boundaries of appropriate refusal behavior, ensuring that models do not reject harmless requests unnecessarily. This dual-focus approach ensures that RedBench captures both offensive vulnerabilities (via attack prompts) and defensive overreach (via refusal prompts), providing holistic framework for evaluating LLM robustness. The distribution of dataset sources reflects the diversity and academic rigor of the collected datasets. The majority of datasets originate from arXiv (8 datasets), ACL (6 datasets), NeurIPS (6 datasets), and ICLR (6 datasets), underscoring the prominence of these venues in LLM and red-teaming 2 2.2 Taxonomy for Datasets critical limitation of existing red teaming datasets is the lack of consistency in risk definitions and categorizations, which often results in labels that are overlapped, ambiguous, or poorly defined (Zou et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024). This fragmentation hinders cross-dataset comparisons and complicates systematic evaluations of LLM vulnerabilities. To address this challenge, we developed standardized taxonomy for adversarial prompts in RedBench, assigning to each of the 29,362 samples two labels: Risk Category and Domain. This taxonomy unifies disparate datasets, ensures clarity in risk and context classification, and facilitates comprehensive red teaming evaluations across diverse scenarios. The taxonomy is structured around two dimensions: Risk Category, which identifies the type of harm or misuse prompt may elicit, and Domain, which specifies the contextual area in which the prompt is situated. By applying this dual-labeling approach, RedBench enables researchers to analyze LLM vulnerabilities with granularity, supporting both broad risk assessments and domain-specific investigations. The following subsections detail the definitions and annotation process for these labels."
        },
        {
            "title": "2.2.1 Risk Categories",
            "content": "We define 22 distinct risk categories, each corresponding to specific type of harm or misuse that LLMs might enable or exacerbate. These categories, presented in Table 8, were developed through systematic review of existing red teaming frameworks (Zou et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024), safety guidelines from organizations such as NIST (Autio et al., 2024) and OWASP (OWASP Foundation, 2025). Each category is precisely defined to avoid overlap, is grounded in real-world implications, and is applicable to wide range of testing scenarios. For prompts designed to evaluate refusal behavior (i.e., benign prompts that should not be rejected), we assign the Risk Category as No Risk to distinguish them from adversarial prompts."
        },
        {
            "title": "2.2.2 Domains",
            "content": "To capture the contextual diversity of adversarial prompts, we define 19 domains, each representing specific area of application or use case for LLMs. These domains, listed in Table 9, were informed by comprehensive analysis of LLM deployment scenarios (Singhal et al., 2022; Maddela et al., 2023), Figure 1: Distribution of publication sources for the 37 benchmark datasets in RedBench. The figure illustrates the diversity of high-quality sources, with arXiv, ACL, NeurIPS, and ICLR being the most represented. research. Additional contributions come from EMNLP, ACM, ICML, EACL, USENIX, and NAACL, ensuring broad representation of perspectives and methodologies. Figure 1 provides visual representation of this distribution, highlighting the balance between preprint repositories and peer-reviewed conference proceedings. To ensure the quality and relevance of RedBench, each dataset was meticulously curated based on (1) Task Relevance: Datasets several criteria: were selected for their alignment with red teaming objectives, focusing on prompts that test model safety, robustness, or refusal behavior. (2) Risk Scenario Coverage: The datasets collectively cover wide spectrum of risk categories, including toxicity, bias, misinformation, jailbreaking, and overrefusal, addressing both offensive and defensive failure modes. (3) Data Integrity: Only datasets with clear documentation, reproducible prompts, and verified sources were included to ensure reliability and usability. This rigorous curation process guarantees that RedBench serves as high-quality, standardized resource for evaluating LLMs in diverse red-teaming scenarios. By aggregating and harmonizing these 37 datasets, RedBench provides unified and comprehensive platform for red teaming research. The datasets extensive coverage of attack and refusal prompts, combined with its diverse and credible sources, positions RedBench as valuable tool for benchmarking modern LLMs and advancing the development of robust and secure language models. stakeholder consultations, and application-specific red-teaming studies (Bhatt et al., 2023; Han et al., 2024). The domains range from specialized fields such as healthcare and military to broader areas such as general knowledge, ensuring that RedBench reflects the multifaceted contexts in which LLMs operate. 2.2.3 Annotation Process To assign Risk Category and Domain labels to all 29,362 samples in RedBench, we implemented semi-automated annotation pipeline that combines the efficiency of state-of-the-art LLMs with the reliability of human oversight. The process utilized Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Team, 2024c), selected for its strong instruction-following capabilities and high performance in classification tasks, further validated by high agreement with human annotators on random sample of 300 prompts (see Appendix for details). The annotation pipeline proceeded as follows: 1. Prompt Design: We developed detailed prompts to guide the LLM in classifying each sample based on the definitions in Tables 8 and 9. These prompts included clear instructions, category/domain definitions, and example annotations to reduce ambiguity and ensure consistent labeling. The prompts were iteratively refined based on pilot annotations to optimize model performance. 2. Automated Labeling: The Qwen2.5-72BInstruct model processed the entire dataset sequentially, assigning Risk Category and Domain label to each sample. To prevent model fatigue or context overload, the dataset was processed in batches, with periodic checks to ensure label consistency. 3. Human Validation: To enhance accuracy, especially for datasets targeting specific domains (e.g., cybersecurity (Bhatt et al., 2023) or healthcare (Han et al., 2024)), we reviewed subset of the LLM-generated labels. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus, and domain-specific samples were re-labeled as needed to align with expert knowledge. This hybrid annotation approach balanced scalability with precision, leveraging the efficiency of LLMs while incorporating human expertise to maintain high-quality labels. The resulting RedBench dataset includes samples, each tagged with unique Risk Category and Domain, ready for use in systematic red teaming evaluations. 2.3 Overview of Analysis To understand the composition of RedBench and its suitability for comprehensive red teaming of large language models (LLMs), we performed detailed analysis of the distribution of risk categories and domains across its 29,362 samples, comprising 33 attack-focused datasets and 4 refusal-focused datasets. This section presents the distribution of risk categories and domains, highlights key patterns and imbalances, and discusses their implications for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities. The analysis leverages quantitative metrics and visualizations to provide insights into the datasets structure and coverage.

The most prevalent risk categories include Abusive Content (3,523 samples), Cybersecurity Threats (2,906 samples), Crime Content (2,668 samples), and Bias Content (2,376 samples), together accounting for significant portion of attack prompts. These categories reflect common vulnerabilities in LLMs, such as susceptibility to generating harmful or biased output (Zou et al., 2023; Mazeika et al., 2024). Less represented categories, such as Confabulation (71 4 Domain Attack Refusal General Knowledge Technology Family Healthcare Politics Biology Finance Law Workplace Entertainment Military Education Nutrition Environment Sports Infrastructure Retail Religion Travel 8,581 4,041 2,666 2,517 1,997 1,304 899 859 801 408 390 303 294 260 230 179 160 122 102 982 314 160 171 251 64 222 271 60 395 53 55 74 45 42 24 24 16 26 Table 2: Sample Counts for Attack and Refusal Prompts by Domain samples) and Election Interference (158 samples), indicate areas where existing datasets are sparse, potentially limiting the evaluation of these risks. The distribution of domains across attack and refusal prompts, shown in Table 2, reveals that General Knowledge (8,581 attack samples, 982 refusal samples) and Technology (4,041 attack samples, 314 refusal samples) are the most represented domains, reflecting their broad applicability in LLM use cases. Other domains, such as Healthcare (2,517 attack samples, 171 refusal samples) and Politics (1,997 attack samples, 251 refusal samples), also have significant representation, while domains like Travel (102 attack samples, 26 refusal samples) and Religion (122 attack samples, 16 refusal samples) are less covered. To explore the relationship between risk categories and domains, we constructed heatmap (Figure 2) that highlights domain-specific risk concentrations. In particular, the Technology domain is heavily associated with Cybersecurity Threats and Malware Code, largely due to contributions from datasets such as CyberattackAssistance (Bhatt et al., 2023). Similarly, the Healthcare domain is dominated by Self-Harm Content, driven by datasets such as MedSafetyBench (Han et al., 2024). In contrast, General Knowledge encompasses broader range of risks, with significant contributions from Abusive Content and Crime Content, reflecting its role as catch-all domain for diverse prompts. This analysis underscores the uneven distribution of risk categories across domains, with certain domains tightly coupled to specific risks. For the four datasets focused on refusal prompts, which test the models tendency to over-defend by rejecting benign prompts, General Knowledge dominates with 982 samples, followed by Entertainment (395 samples) and Technology (314 samples). This distribution suggests that refusal prompts are often designed for broad, general-purpose interactions, potentially reflecting the need to ensure usability in common use cases. The limited representation of refusal prompts in specialized domains, such as Military (53 samples) or Religion (16 samples), indicates gap in evaluating over-defensive behavior in these contexts. Table 1 and Table 2 provide additional insights into the distribution of risk categories and domains for attack prompts, respectively. The bar charts reveal the skewed nature of the dataset, with few risk categories and domains comprising the majority of samples, while others are underrepresented. This imbalance highlights the need for an increase in the targeted dataset in future RedBench iterations to ensure comprehensive coverage of all risk categories and domains."

Attack prompts are heavily concentrated in few risk categories (e.g., Abusive Content, Cybersecurity Threats) and domains (e.g., General Knowledge, Technology), while categories like Confabulation and domains like Religion are underrepresented. Similarly, refusal prompts are skewed toward General Knowledge, with limited coverage in specialized domains. These imbalances reflect the focus of existing datasets and highlight gaps in red-teaming resources for certain risks and contexts. Addressing these gaps through targeted dataset expansion will be critical to ensuring comprehensive evaluations of LLM robustness across various scenarios."

Table 3 summarizes the Rejection Rates for each model across these datasets, along with the average performance. The results reveal significant variation in Rejection Rates across models and datasets. Llama2Note that models such as Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude were excluded due to API access limitations within our organization, ensuring that our evaluation focuses on accessible and reproducible setups. 7 3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits the highest average Rejection Rate (28.53%), indicating tendency to over-defend, particularly on XSTest (32.60%) and SGXSTest (29.60%). This suggests that Llama3.1-8B-Instruct may prioritize safety at the expense of usability, potentially rejecting legitimate requests in domains such as General Knowledge, which dominates refusal prompts (see Table 2). In contrast, Gemma-2-9B-It demonstrates the lowest average Rejection Rate (13.46%), with notably low rates on CoCoNot (9.93%) and SGXSTest (11.60%), suggesting more permissive response strategy. Among closed-source models, GPT-4.1Nano shows high Rejection Rate on ORBench (35.18%), while GPT-4o-Mini maintains more balanced average (17.47%). 3.3.2 Results on Attack Benchmark Datasets The attack datasets, evaluated using the Attack Success Rate (ASR, Equation 2), assess the susceptibility of LLMs to adversarial prompts that elicit unsafe or inappropriate responses. We focus on HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024) as representative dataset, testing four red teaming methods: Direct, ZeroShot, HumanJailbreak, and RainbowPlus (see Red-Teaming Methods). Table 4 presents the ASR for each model and method. The results highlight stark differences in the vulnerability of the model between the redteaming methods. Open-source models, particularly Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410, exhibit high ASRs, with RainbowPlus achieving near-perfect 97.81% and HumanJailbreak at 90.63%. Llama3.1-8B-Instruct also shows significant vulnerability, with ASRs of 96.25% (RainbowPlus) and 91.72% (HumanJailbreak). In contrast, closed-source models, especially GPT-4.1-Nano, demonstrate robust resistance, with ASRs as low as 0.00% (HumanJailbreak) and 6.88% (RainbowPlus). GPT-4o-Mini is slightly more vulnerable, but still outperforms open-source models, with maximum ASR of 28.75% (RainbowPlus). The effectiveness of red teaming methods varies significantly. HumanJailbreak is highly successful against open-source models (90.63%93.91%) but fails against closed-source models, likely due to their advanced safety mechanisms. RainbowPlus, however, proves effective across both model types, achieving high ASRs even for GPT-4o-Mini (28.75%) and GPT-4.1-Nano (6.88%).

Empirical results show that open-source models are particularly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, especially under RainbowPlus, while closed-source models demonstrate stronger resistance. High Rejection Rates in refusal benchmarks further highlight usability challenges. Our contributions include (1) standardized red teaming dataset, (2) an analysis identifying gaps in risk and domain coverage, and (3) baseline evaluations of contemporary LLMs released alongside the dataset. Future work will expand underrepresented categories and domains, evaluate broader range of models, and incorporate more advanced red teaming methods. Overall, RedBench provides foundation for systematic and reproducible red teaming, supporting the development of safer and more robust LLMs. nerabilities in openand closed-source LLMs. To further investigate the vulnerability of the model, we analyzed the ASR of RainbowPlus across risk categories and domains, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a illustrates that Ministral-8BInstruct-2410 is particularly vulnerable to Economic Harm and Extremism and Radicalization, indicating weaknesses in handling prompts related to financial crimes and ideological manipulation. Other models, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, also show elevated ASRs in these categories, though to lesser extent. Figure 3b reveals that the Environment and Nutrition domains are especially susceptible, with Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410, possibly due to limited safety training in these specialized contexts."

            "content": "RedBench offers robust and standardized resource for red teaming large language models (LLMs), aggregating diverse set of existing datasets into unified framework. Nonetheless, as with any large-scale dataset, certain aspects reflect the current state of the field and present opportunities for further refinement. The sample distribution in RedBench mirrors the emphasis found in prior red teaming efforts, with higher representation of well-studied risk categories such as Abusive Content and Cybersecurity Threats, and domains like General Knowledge and Technology (Section 2.3). Categories like Confabulation and Election Interference, as well as domains such as Religion and Travel, have comparatively fewer samples. Future expansions could incorporate additional targeted collections to achieve even broader coverage across emerging risk scenarios. The annotation process employs scalable semiautomated pipeline with state-of-the-art LLM assistance and human validation (Section 2.2.3). While effective, ongoing advancements in annotation techniques could further enhance consistency, particularly for complex or ambiguous cases. Our experimental evaluation focuses on selection of representative LLMs available as of late 2025 (Section 3.2). Continuous benchmarking with newly released models would provide valuable insights into evolving safety alignments. Additionally, RedBench primarily comprises Englishlanguage prompts, consistent with the majority of sourced datasets; extending to multilingual content would broaden its applicability. These considerations highlight pathways to strengthen RedBench as the landscape of LLM safety research progresses, ensuring it continues to serve as valuable community resource."

            "title": "A Discussion",
            "content": "Section Results, reveal both the strengths and vulnerabilities of modern LLMs, highlighting key challenges and opportunities to advance the robustness of the model. The evaluation of refusal benchmarks (CoCoNut, ORBench, SGXSTest, and XSTest) demonstrates significant variability in Rejection Rates across models. Llama-3.1-8B-Instructs high Rejection Rate (28.53% average) indicates an over-defensive stance, particularly in domains like General Knowledge, which may limit its usability in real-world applications where legitimate prompts are common (Brahman et al., 2024). In constrast, Gemma2-9B-ITs lower Rejection Rate (13.46% average) suggests more permissive approach, potentially improving usability but risking insufficient safety barriers. The high Rejection Rate of GPT-4.1-Nano on ORBench (35.18%) underscores the influence of dataset-specific prompt design, suggesting that refusal benchmarks require further standardization to ensure consistent evaluation across models. For attack benchmarks, the Attack Success Rates (ASRs) on HarmBench reveal stark differences between open-source and closed-source models. Open-source models, particularly Ministral-8BInstruct-2410 (97.81% ASR with RainbowPlus) and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (96.25% ASR with RainbowPlus), exhibit significant vulnerabilities to adversarial prompts, especially in risk categories such as Economic Harm and Extremism and Radicalization, and domains such as Environment and Nutrition (Dang et al., 2025). In contrast, closed-source models such as GPT-4.1-Nano (6.88% ASR with RainbowPlus) and GPT-4o-Mini (28.75% ASR with RainbowPlus) demonstrate robust resistance, probably due to advanced safety alignment techniques. The effectiveness of the RainbowPlus method across both types of models highlights its potency as red teaming strategy, which warrants further investigation of its mechanisms and potential countermeasures. The analysis in Section Overview of Analysis reveals significant imbalances in RedBenchs composition, with risk categories like Abusive Content (3,523 samples) and Cybersecurity Threats (2,906 samples) dominating attack prompts, while categories like Confabulation (71 samples) and Election Interference (158 samples) are underrepresented. Similarly, domains like General Knowledge (8,581 attack samples) and Technology (4,041 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 5 6 6 7 7 7 8 9 14 15 15 15 16 16 16 16 17 19 19 20 23 26 26 14 attack samples) are overrepresented, while domains like Religion (122 attack samples) and Travel (102 attack samples) are sparse. These imbalances reflect the focus of existing datasets and highlight gaps in coverage for certain risks and contexts. For example, the limited representation of Election Interference prompts may hinder LLM evaluations in political contexts, critical area given their potential to influence democratic processes (Autio et al., 2024). Addressing these gaps through targeted dataset augmentation is essential for ensuring comprehensive red-teaming evaluations. Despite its contributions, RedBench has limitations that merit discussion. First, the reliance on existing datasets introduces biases inherent in their design, such as the skew toward General Knowledge and Technology domains. Second, the semiautomated annotation pipeline, while efficient, may introduce inconsistencies in edge cases, despite human validation efforts (Section Annotation Process). Third, the evaluation of only six LLMs, constrained by API access limitations for models like Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude, limits the generalizability of our findings. Finally, the focus on HarmBench for attack evaluations, while representative, may not fully capture the diversity of adversarial prompts in RedBench, suggesting the need for broader testing across all 33 attack datasets. The findings have broader implications for LLM development and deployment. The high ASRs of open-source models underscore the need for improved safety alignment techniques, particularly for domains like Environment and Nutrition, where vulnerabilities are pronounced. The trade-off between safety and usability, evident in high Rejection Rates, suggests that developers must balance defensive mechanisms to avoid compromising user experience. In addition, the open source of RedBench and its evaluation code promotes transparency and reproducibility, allowing the research community to build on our work and develop stronger LLMs for safety-critical applications such as healthcare (Singhal et al., 2022) and legal advisory systems (Maddela et al., 2023)."

            "content": "This section reviews prior work on red-teaming large language models (LLMs), focusing on automated red-teaming techniques and datasets designed for red-teaming. We situate RedBench within this landscape, highlighting its contributions to addressing the limitations of existing approaches, particularly in dataset standardization and comprehensive coverage of risk scenarios. B.1 Automated Red Teaming Red teaming is critical for evaluating and aligning LLMs by identifying vulnerabilities that lead to unsafe, biased, or incorrect output (Zou et al., 2023). Traditional manual red teaming, while effective in controlled settings, is labor-intensive and scales poorly with the complexity of modern LLMs. Automated red teaming has emerged as scalable alternative, using computational methods to generate adversarial prompts that elicit undesirable responses. The early work of Perez et al. (2022a) pioneered this field, demonstrating that LLMs could autonomously generate test cases to uncover harmful outputs, reducing the dependence on human oversight. Subsequent research has advanced this paradigm through fully automated and hybrid strategies. For example, Deng et al. (2023) combined manual curation with in-context learning to improve prompt efficacy, while Paulus et al. (2024) introduced an optimization algorithm that prioritizes efficiency and speed in prompt generation. Liu et al. (2023) developed goal-oriented adversarial attack frameworks, tailoring prompts to specific failure modes such as toxicity or misinformation. Furthermore, quality-diversity search techniques, such as Rainbow (Samvelyan et al., 2024) and its enhanced version RainbowPlus (Dang et al., 2025), have improved the diversity and effectiveness of adversarial prompts, allowing for more comprehensive vulnerability assessments. These advancements underscore the need for robust datasets to support automated red teaming, which RedBench aims to address. B.2 Datasets for Red Teaming The development of red-teaming datasets has been pivotal in enabling systematic evaluation of LLM vulnerabilities. Existing datasets, such as HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), and DAN (Shen et al., 2024a), focus on attack prompts designed to elicit unsafe responses, covering risks such as toxicity, misinformation, and jailbreaking. However, these datasets often lack standardized risk categorizations, leading to overlapping or ambiguous labels that hinder cross-dataset comparisons. For refusal testing, datasets like CoCoNut (Brahman et al., 15 2024), ORBench (Cui et al., 2024), and StrongREJECT (Souly et al., 2024) assess over-defensive behavior by evaluating responses to benign prompts, but their limited domain coverage and inconsistent prompt design limit generalizability. Specialized datasets, such as PurpleLlamaCyberSecEval (Bhatt et al., 2023) for cybersecurity and MedSafetyBench (Han et al., 2024) for healthcare, address domain-specific risks, but lack integration into unified framework. RedBench addresses these limitations by aggregating 37 benchmark datasets, comprising 29,362 samples, into standardized framework with comprehensive taxonomy of 22 risk categories and 19 domains (see Section 2.2). Unlike previous datasets, RedBench unifies attack and refusal prompts, ensuring broad coverage of risk scenarios and facilitating systematic evaluations."

            "content": "To validate the reliability of our semi-automated annotation pipeline, which utilizes Qwen2.5-72BInstruct for assigning Risk Category and Domain labels (Section 2.2.3), we conducted human evaluation on randomly selected subset of 300 samples from RedBench. Three independent runs were performed, each involving human annotators labeling the samples according to the definitions in Tables 8 and 9. The agreement between Qwen2.572B-Instruct predictions and human annotations was then measured. As shown in Table 5, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct achieves high agreement with human annotators, averaging 84.68% for Risk Category and 97.73% for Domain across the three runs. The low standard deviation (2.66% for categories and 0.88% for domains) indicates consistent performance. The notably higher agreement on Domain labels reflects the more objective nature of contextual classification compared to risk assessment, which can involve subtler judgments. These results confirm the reliability of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct as an annotator, supporting its use in scaling the labeling process for RedBench while maintaining high-quality annotations comparable to human standards."

Table 6 provides an overview of each dataset integrated into RedBench, including its abbreviated name and the original publication from which it was derived. The breadth of sources reflects the heterogeneity of threat models and safety concerns addressed by recent research on LLMs. To promote transparency and facilitate reproducibility, we provide detailed metadata for each dataset used in RedBench, including sample size, license type, and access link. This metadata is summarized in Table 7. Notably, all datasets are either freely available under permissive licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) or governed by communityoriented terms, allowing RedBench to serve as shared infrastructure for safety evaluations."

            "title": "F Additional Analysis",
            "content": "To complement the primary results presented in Section 3.3, this section provides detailed analysis of the RedBench datasets performance across domains and risk categories, focusing on both refusal and attack prompts. By examining Rejection Rates and Attack Success Rates (ASRs) at granular level, we uncover domain-specific and category-specific vulnerabilities in the evaluated LLMs, offering insights into their robustness and highlighting areas for future improvement. The analysis aggregates results across six state-of-theart LLMs (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9BIT, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Ministral-8B-Instruct2410, GPT-4o-Mini, and GPT-4.1-Nano) to provide comprehensive view of performance trends. F.1 Refusal Results by Domain The refusal datasets (CoCoNot (Brahman et al., 2024), ORBench (Cui et al., 2024), SGXSTest, and XSTest (Souly et al., 2024)) evaluate the tendency of LLMs to incorrectly reject benign prompts, measured by the Rejection Rate (see Section 3.1). Table 10 presents the average Rejection Rates across 16 Run Run 1 Run 2 Run Risk Category Agreement (%) Domain Agreement (%) 85.71 87.30 81.03 97.75 98.80 96.63 Average Std 84.68 2.66 97.73 0. Table 5: Agreement Between Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and Human Annotations on 300 Random Samples the six LLMs for each domain, providing insights into domain-specific over-defensive behavior. The results reveal significant variability in Rejection Rates across domains and datasets. The Retail domain exhibits the highest Rejection Rate on CoCoNot (50.00%) and XSTest (30.56%), suggesting that LLMs may overly flag benign prompts related to e-commerce or consumer behavior as sensitive, potentially due to misinterpretations of commercial intent. Similarly, the Family domain shows high Rejection Rate on CoCoNot (28.69%), possibly reflecting cautious handling of prompts related to interpersonal relationships. In contrast, domains like Biology and Education have consistently low Rejection Rates across most datasets (e.g., 0.00% on SGXSTest and XSTest), indicating that LLMs are less likely to over-defend in these contexts. Notably, SGXSTest yields zero Rejection Rates across several domains (e.g., Biology, Education, Infrastructure), suggesting that its prompts may be less challenging or insufficiently diverse to trigger over-defensive behavior. ORBench, however, elicits higher Rejection Rates in domains like Finance (28.71%) and Infrastructure (27.27%), indicating that its prompts are more effective at probing overdefensive tendencies. These findings highlight the uneven effectiveness of refusal datasets and underscore the need for more balanced prompt designs in future iterations of RedBench. Figure 4 illustrates model-specific Rejection Rates across domains for each benchmark. On CoCoNut and ORBench (Figures 4a and 4b), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct consistently exhibits higher Rejection Rates compared to other models, indicating conservative safety alignment that may compromise usability. For SGXSTest (Figure 4c), Rejection Rates are non-zero in Finance, Nutrition, and Travel, suggesting limited domain coverage. XSTest (Figure 4d) shows broader domain engagement, with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct over-refusing across multiple domains and GPT-4.1-Nano notably refusing Travel prompts. The reveals analysis that Llama-3.1-8BInstructs high Rejection Rates, particularly in Retail and Family, suggest an overly conservative safety alignment, potentially limiting usability in consumer and interpersonal applications. GPT-4.1-Nanos elevated refusal in Travel on XSTest indicates domain-specific sensitivities. The limited effectiveness of SGXSTest underscores the need for more diverse refusal prompts. F.2 Attack Results by Category and Domain The attack datasets evaluate the susceptibility of LLMs to adversarial prompts, measured by the Attack Success Rate (ASR) across four red teaming methods: Direct, HumanJailbreak, ZeroShot, and RainbowPlus (see Section 3.1). Tables 11 and 12 present the average ASRs across the six LLMs, broken down by risk category and domain, respectively. Table 11 shows that RainbowPlus is the most effective red teaming method, achieving high ASRs across multiple risk categories, particularly Extremism and Radicalization (83.33%) and Economic Harm (66.67%). HumanJailbreak also performs strongly, with ASRs above 60% for most categories, except Intellectual Property (53.42%). In contrast, the Direct method yields lower ASRs, with Intellectual Property (8.76%) and Economic Harm (16.67%) being the least susceptible, suggesting that simple prompts are less effective at bypassing safety mechanisms. ZeroShot shows moderate success but is notably ineffective for Economic Harm (0.00%), indicating that this category may require more sophisticated attack strategies. Table 12 highlights domain-specific vulnerabilities, with Nutrition (83.33% ASR for RainbowPlus) and Environment (66.67% ASR for RainbowPlus and HumanJailbreak) being particularly susceptible. The Healthcare domain shows consistently high ASRs across all methods (50.00%66.67%), reflecting the critical need for robust safety mechanisms in this safety-sensitive domain.

Red-Teaming Methods This section contains details of the Red-Teaming methods used in Results on Attack Benchmark Datasets. Zero-Shot (Perez et al., 2022c): Generate test cases using an attacker LLM in zero-shot setting, prioritizing scalability, but often lacking specificity for targeted behaviors. Human Jailbreaks (Human) (Wang et al., 2024b): Applies in-the-wild jailbreak templates (e.g. Do Anything Now, DAN) with substituted behavior strings, testing templatedriven attacks but lacking adaptability. Direct: Uses raw behavior strings as prompts to test LLMs refusal capabilities, serving as lower-bound baseline for safety alignment. RainbowPlus (Dang et al., 2025): adaptive Quality-Diversity search, that achieves superior attack efficacy and prompt diversity, outperforming both QD-based methods and state-of-the-art red-teaming approaches."
