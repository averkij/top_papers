            "content": "The capabilities and flaws of multimodal foundation models are often directly attributable to their training data [66], [74], [75], [90], [91], [117], [130]. While the importance of data measurement has been widely established by prior work [118], so has prevailing absence of data documentation [10], [39], transparency [73], and detailed understanding [34], [37], [47]especially for modalities other than text. lack of thorough data analysis has led to significant challenges, including privacy issues [107], retracting datasets with harmful content [35], [80], adversarially bypassing safety filters [66], facial recognition bias with respect to gender and skin type [11], gender bias in hiring [77], benchmark contamination from overlapping train and test sets [87], and challenges in copyright [84]. Understanding data provenance can aid mitigation attempts to reduce model bias and toxicity [50], [102] address representation in data [51], contamination [81], and quality [59], [95], as well as practical challenges with identifying copyright-free and permissively licensed sets [96]. 1 The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 DATASETS SIZE # SOURCES # DOMAINS CREATOR ORGS COUNTRIES # LANGUAGES # FAMILIES TASKS LICENSES TEXT SPEECH VIDEO TOTAL 3717 95 104 3916 713 2.1T 775k 51 1.13M 44 - 798 23 16 24 83 534 124 101 659 60 29 67 502 260 - 608 21 36 - 37 395 18 443 50 19 11 55 Table 1: We quantify the breadth of our audit, including the total number of datasets (#), their size in tokens or hours, the sources, domains, creator organizations, countries, languages, tasks, and licenses. In aggregate, we audited 3916 datasets from 659 organizations in 67 countries, spanning 2.1T tokens, and 1.9M hours. We cataloged nearly 798 unique sources, 443 tasks, and 55 licenses. Despite the urgent need for the provenance and characteristics of widely used datasets, the majority of attention to date has centered on text datasets [81], [123], or single feature such as prevalence of hate content [35], [37]. In contrast, in this work, we will critically examine several provenance features of data across text, speech, and video. We conduct the largest and most comprehensive multimodal audit of AI data, to date, reviewing nearly 4000 datasets between 1990-2024, covering 443 unique tasks, 608 languages, derived from 798 original sources, and constructed by 659 organizations, spanning 67 countries, over 1T tokens of text, and 1.9M hours of speech and video content (see Table 1). There is an unprecedented acceleration in the development of multimodal AI systems, making all the more urgent an understanding of the datasets that underpin these breakthroughs. Our extensive collection of features from unstructured academic papers, websites, and repositories enables us to provide empirical grounding to an ambitious set of research questions surrounding data sourcing trends, intended licenses, and geographical and linguistic representation. Our key findings include: 1. Multimodal data is increasingly sourced from the web, social media platforms, or synthetically generated; rather than more curated sources such as movies, audiobooks or manually collected. These sources comprise the vast majority of text tokens, as well as speech and video hours in public data. However, while social media platforms provide data scale, heterogeneity and freshness by nature, they are also particularly prone to anti-crawling, copyright, privacy, and factuality concerns. 2. Whereas only 25% of text, speech, and video datasets have non-commercial licenses, over 80% of content from each modality carries undocumented restrictions in the datasets sources. Dataset licenses are inconsistent with their sources restrictions for over 55% of content. Our audit provides the tools for multimodal developers to identify dataset restrictions, and apply their own standards. 3. Geographical and linguistic representation have not improved for decade, across the data ecosystem. While the amount of data from under-represented creators and languages increases each year, to over 600 languages and 60 countries in 2024, their relative representation remains consistently western-centric, with no significant improvements from > 0.7 Gini coefficients. While Africa and South America organizations account for < 0.2% of all modality content, North America or European organizations span 93% of text tokens and 60%+ hours of speech and video. Our work provides critical insights into the landscape of available multimodal data. We release the entire audit, collected data, and analysis tools, which we believe will bring immense value for data creators, developers, and researchers interested in promoting the responsible development of AI systems and analysis of the AI data ecosystem."

            "title": "2 METHODOLOGY",
            "content": "While many prior works have surveyed the dataset ecosystem [15], [42], [103], [114], [121], few empirically examine data corpora at scale, and those that do focus present more narrow focus around specific feature like geographic bias or hate content[8], [62], [71] or single modality [36], [37], [81], [123]. The goal of this work is to provide an empirical, ecosystem-level, and multimodal analysis of widely used training datasets [76]. Our audit focuses on text, speech, and video, as prominent data modalities behind modern multimodal systems, such as Sora, Whisper, Gemini, GPT-4o, and others [100], [104], [108], [115], [129], [140]. Since training data for modalities can often be independent, multimodal models tend to interleave training batches with different combinations of one or two 2 The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 modalities [70]. As such, we focus our analysis on datasets that represent one or pair of these modalities. Annotation Features & Methodology In particular, we analyze data trends for the state of data permissions (licenses and terms), sourcing (the web, human annotation, and synthetic generation), and representation (of tasks, organizations, languages, and countries). We adopt Longpre, Mahari, Chen, et al. [123]s methodology, including the license annotation taxonomy and process, to manually audit these features precisely and rigorously. We go beyond prior work, which considers dataset licenses, by extending the taxonomy to consider the terms of use of the sources of the dataset, either from models used to generate synthetic data (e.g. OpenAIs non-compete clause1 or Metas acceptable use policy for Llama 3.12), or the sources policy on content restrictions, which can be conveyed in the form of license, terms of use, or content policy on website [119]. For each dataset, the source terms are annotated as Unrestricted, Unspecified, Source Closed or Model Closed, as defined in Table 2. For Figure 2 we combine Source Closed and Model Closed into Restricted. As with prior work [123], [124], we engage domain experts for these annotation tasksAI researchers whose work pertains to the modality and topic. Because many datasets are iteratively re-packaged before they appear in their final form and often shared on popular dataset marketplaces like HuggingFace, Papers with Code or Github, prior work has found that relevant licensing terms or sourcing information for AI training data is frequently omitted [123]. To ensure we collect this information, we require full trace of metadata back to their original sources (sometimes chain of github repositories, websites, or academic papers). This search can be onerous, especially for terms and licenses, but ensures rigor in the results. Table 1 enumerates the full statistics of our audit. All annotations and analysis code will be made publicly available on release. Scope & Dataset Selection For each modality, we define the scope of the audit (detailed separately below), then aggregate resources to distill list of relevant datasets. The scope is focused on (a) publicly available datasets, (b) widely used tasks in the context of general-purpose model development, and (c) relevance to generative tasks. However, we do consider classification-based datasets in text, speech, and video that can and are frequently re-purposed for generative uses (e.g. instruction tuning). Within the defined audit scope, we use mix of the HuggingFace Datasets platform, survey papers, survey repositories, workshop proceedings, and expert review to accumulate relevant datasets. More detail about the dataset selection and collection process is given for each modality below. Each modality requires its own independent process, by virtue of their community dataset ecosystems being unique (discussed in Section 4). Note that text has wider heterogeneity of published publicly available datasets than speech or video. Typically those datasets have been aggregated into large, standardized text-to-text collections, and as such we trace both these Text (Collections) and their constituent Text (Datasets). All datasets are described, linked, and attributed in Appendix D. 2.1 TEXT Scope We focus on providing an extensive audit for post-training datasets, used in training language models. We include single and multi-turn formats, encompassing both datasets typically used for instruction finetuning (SFT) and preference alignment [105]. This scope reflects the prominent role of general-purpose language models, which benefit from multi-task training on heterogeneous collections that span variety of linguistic, reasoning, and knowledge intensive tasks like question answering, coding, tool use, translation, and classification [49], [64]. Dataset Selection We expand the study conducted by the Data Provenance Collection [123], from 44 dataset collections (of 1858 supervised text datasets) to superset of 108 collections of 3717 datasets, prioritizing recent, popular publicly available HuggingFace Datasets introduced between 2022 and April 2024. Our collection sourced popular datasets from recent survey papers [114], [121] and tools [122]. We additionally reviewed HuggingFace Datasets most downloaded datasets every month, from April to July 2024, under the Natural Language Processing category, as well as the SFT/DPO datasets associated with popular open model releases. We also drew from major multilingual data repositories, including the SEACrowd Catalogue [126], the Masader Arabic Data Catalogue [52], AI4Bharat [27], and the Aya Collection [134]. Lastly, our list of datasets was reviewed and supplemented by language model experts to fill in notable omissions. In total, we trace 1OpenAI Terms of Use 2Llama 3.1 Acceptable Use Policy The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 the provenance and features of 3713 text datasets from 108 collections, covering 395 popular tasks, spanning from 1994 to 2024. 2.2 SPEECH Scope We audit speech datasets for which automatic speech recognition (ASR) was noted as primary task. We focus on ASR datasets because: (1) ASR is fundamental to many speech technologies, including dictation tools, voice assistants, and chatbots [32], [68]; (2) large-scale speech datasets are typically designed for ASR [89]; (3) ASR data follows standardized formats, making comparisons easier (e.g., corpus of audio clips paired with text); and (4) ASR data can often be reused for other tasks like text to speech (TTS) [7] or language identification [20]. Dataset Selection To curate representative sample of popular ASR datasets, we relied on combination of survey repositories3, and HuggingFace Datasets using the Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech task tags. We expanded coverage to well-documented datasets on the OpenSLR4 platform, even if they were newer or less widely used. We expect this might reflect datasets that could be adopted more widely in the future. Finally, we included datasets related to low-resource languages and other languages not well-covered by our initial searches. Speech recognition models are increasingly highly multilingual [33], [104], [131], and datasets serving different communities of builders and end-users around the world are priority for making speech recognition technologies more inclusive. In total, we trace the provenance and features of 95 speech datasets, covering 18 popular ASR tasks, spanning from 1990 to 2024. 2.3 VIDEO Scope Early video understanding models primarily focused on video classification, detection and action recognition, where short clips were categorized into predefined classes [30], [69]. More advanced tasks such as temporal action segmentation, video question answering, and video captioning were later introduced to build upon these foundational tasks [63], [111]. Recently, following the success in the field of image generation, video generation from text has become new task that has shown promising results [72], [82], [115], [140]. Given the scarcity of datasets for text-to-video and the often undocumented sources of data used in recent video generation models [127], we take broader approach to our collection of video datasets. We focus on annotating popular video tasks and limit our scope to datasets corresponding to video tasks that are either published, highly cited, or have 100+ downloads on HuggingFace. This approach is justified by three key factors: (1) the usefulness of video data to the research community stems from its collection and presentation in peer-reviewed work, (2) datasets can often be repurposed between different tasks, allowing for applicability to new tasks such as video generation from text, and (3) focusing on highly cited datasets ensures that datasets quality and relevance has been validated by the research community. Dataset Selection We include datasets tagged with Video Classification, Text-to-Video, and Video-Text-to-Text from HuggingFace Datasets. We augmented this with datasets tagged by Video Understanding or Video Generation in PapersWithCode, as well as datasets listed in popular Github survey repository. We also consulted the proceedings of recent video workshops: the Large Scale Video Understanding and Egocentric Vision workshops. We separately consulted committee of non-author video experts to supplement the list with relevant datasets published at CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and IJCV. In total, we trace the provenance and features of 104 video datasets, covering 33 popular video tasks, spanning from 2009 to 2024."

            "title": "3 RESULTS",
            "content": "We discuss three key results related to (1) the rising use of web, social media and synthetic sources, (2) inconsistent and opaque restrictions on data use, and (3) lack of improvement in geographical or linguistic representation. Each of these findings holds across modalities, at the ecosystem level. 3.1 RISING USE OF WEB, SOCIAL MEDIA & SYNTHETIC DATA The need for scale, and heterogeneity have driven rising use of data from web-crawled, social media, and synthetic data sources. Developers have sought out ever larger and conveniently 3The Speech Datasets Collection 4openslr.org: Open Speech and Language Resources. OpenSLR is widely used platform in the speech community, dedicated to hosting resources for speech tasks. 4 The Data Provenance Initiative, Figure 1: The cumulative size of data (log-scale tokens for text, hours for speech/video) from each source category, across modalities. The source categories in the legend are ordered by descending quantity. Speech and video sources are increasingly dominated by internet videos and YouTube. Whereas text is predominantly web or encyclopedia-based (wiki) sources, synthetic text is rising in popularity. accessible sources of training data [24], [57]. While small, human-curated datasets are often sufficient and sometimes preferred due to higher quality, these sources often do not scale to present demands [24], [26]. In Figure 1, we empirically measure the rising use of web crawling and social media (or forum) websites that provide some of the most scalable and fresh content. While web-sourced data was always prominent, the balance of sources becomes much more skewed after 2018note the use of the y-axis log scale. We find for Speech and Video that by far the most prominent source of data has become internet videos, and specifically YouTube. Nearly 1M hours each of Speech and Video data from this source far outstrips the next most common sources, which comprise less than 100K hours. For Speech, the primary data sources used to be Calling Platforms (pre-2017), content manually collected with Human Participation, and Audiobooks, but since 2018 internet videos have supplanted these other sources. For Video, since 2013, YouTube, synthetic, and general web data sources all constitute significantly larger portion of data used in prominent video datasets, outstripping the use of Movies, Flickr, Getty, or human curated sources. Among text post-training datasets, we see similar trend with general or news web-based sources, including encyclopedic sources (mainly Wikipedia), providing the majority of tokens over time. Encyclopedic sources alone now contribute over 1T tokens in total. Synthetic data sources are rising the most rapidly. Within the video modality, the introduction of VidProm [138] in 2024, consisting of nearly 7M synthetically generated videos, offered large shift in the video source distribution. Within the textual modality, from fig. 1, synthetic data represented <0.1% of the quantity of Web Encyclopedia data in 2020, but is now 10% its proportion in 2024, making up the 5th largest source of tokens. The top models used in generating datasets are mainly from OpenAI. The top 5 consist of ChatGPT, version unspecified (15.0% of synthetic datasets), GPT-4 (14.4%), BART (10.1%), GPT-3 (8.3%) and GPT-3.5-Turbo (4.9%). The average synthetic dataset also has notably longer turns (in tokens) than the average natural dataset: 1,756 tokens vs 1,065. The task distribution of textual synthetic datasets is shifted towards longer form, open-generation and creative tasks. For example, 88.1% of natural datasets contain classification tasks, compared to only 66.3% of synthetic datasets. Natural data is also more likely to cover translation than synthetic data (72.4% of datasets vs only 22.9% of synthetic datasets). 3.2 INCONSISTENT USE RESTRICTIONS In the United States, creators of work automatically have copyright interest that gives them exclusive rights to make copies and derivatives of the work (17 U.S.C. 106). Licenses are legal documents through which the owners of work express how others may use their work. By contrast, Terms of Service express contract between platform and its users to spell out how platform and its content may be used [28]. For simplicity, we use Licenses to refer to dataset restrictions, and Terms to refer to restrictions on the sources of datasets. There remain open questions about whether certain data licenses are enforceable, but these licenses signal the intention of data creators and therefore warrant consideration as the data creators may be best positioned to understand the sensitivities of the data (privacy, copyright, representation, etc.), and the most impacted by its downstream use [88], [93], [94], [97]. The extent to which practitioner adheres to dataset licenses or source terms remains 5 The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 Figure 2: The distribution of restrictions from dataset licenses and their sources terms. We break this down by the count of datasets (top), as well as total tokens or hours (bottom). Each license is categorized as Non-commercial/Academic (NC/Acad), Unspecified, or Commercially licensed. Each dataset may also have terms from the source: Restricted to non-commercial use, Unspecified restrictions, or Unrestricted. Two main findings across modalities emerge: (1) Commercially licensed datasets represent larger set of tokens and hours, relative to number of datasets; however, (2) the vast majority of those commercially licensed tokens/hours bare restrictions from their sources. Tables 3 and 4 in the appendix provide detailed numbers. an open question, and may depend on jurisdiction or the desired models use cases [88]. This work does not propose one standard for all developers. For these reasons we restrict our treatment and discussion here to tracing the lineage and distribution of licenses and terms for given modality. Data source terms are much more restrictive than the datasets documented license restrictions. In Figure 2, we find only 25%, 33%, and 32% of text/speech/video datasets are licensed noncommercially. This value is even lower if we consider the proportion of tokens or hours, with 21%, 26%, and 33% of text/speech/video quantities carrying license restrictions. However, staggering 99.8%, 78%, and 99% of those quantities carry some form of non-commercial restriction on one of their sources. For text, these restrictions are frequently from being generated by OpenAI or other models with non-compete clause, while for speech and videos this is often since the datasets are derived from web or social media sources. Inconsistencies between dataset licenses and their sources restrictions pose challenges to practitioners. large amount of datasets have permissive or unspecified licenses, but some set of their sources carry non-commercial restrictions. This inconsistency is measurablerepresenting 79% of tokens in text datasets, 55% of speech hours, and 65% of video hours. Additionally, 19%, 14%, and 36% of text, speech, and video datasets have no license or intended use documentation (from our audit of the datasets documentation on Hugging Face Datasets, GitHub, and Papers with Code). lack of centralized documentation around these restrictions means it can be misleading to developers who are attempting to source data according to their own legal standards for copyright and privacy. Furthermore, lack of documentation can hamper developers following best practices around data preparation and transparency [39], [73]. Large quantities of commercially licensed text datasets are locked in collections without clear information to separate them from restrictive datasets. In Figure 2 (top and bottom), we see the number of datasets and number of tokens without restrictions is significantly higher for Text (Datasets) than Text (Collections). Specifically, 60% more Datasets (or 75% more tokens) are commercially licensed, than for Collections. This demonstrates that many collections contain significant amounts of commercially licensed data. While our audit traces licenses for all datasets within collection, 6 The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 most collections do not aggregate or expose this documentation. As result, practitioners may be left without easy access to filter for the subsets appropriate for their sourcing standards. 3.3 GEOGRAPHICAL & LINGUISTIC REPRESENTATION IS NOT IMPROVING AFRICA ASIA EUROPE AMERICA OCEANIA AMERICA TEXT SPEECH VIDEO TEXT SPEECH VIDEO 0.3 3.6 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.

Figure 3: The geographical distribution of countries (world maps) and continents (table) represented by dataset creators. Despite some differences in European, Russian, and Middle Eastern representation, creators are heavily concentrated in the US, China, and Western Europe, with little to no representation in South America or Africa, across modalities. The current Gini coefficient for (Text, Speech, Video) = (0.92, 0.86, 0.74), where higher values indicate more concentration. The importance and progress of representation in AI training data. Diversity and representation in training datasets, and among their creators, are widely acknowledged as essential to building AI models that are less biased, more useful, and more equitable [6], [18], [25], [31], [61], [101], [112], [113], [134], [137]. Prior work has measured the diversity of languages in data along with cultural, ideological, and geographical imbalances [8], [14], [41], [55], [62]. These studies have exposed significant flaws, often in the form of bias and discrimination, stemming directly from poor representation in data [12], [35]. As this problem has now been widely acknowledged for decades, recent efforts have foregrounded sourcing data multilingually and multi-culturally, from native speakers and creators (e.g. ROOTS [60], the Aya Dataset [134], the SEACrowd Catalogue [126], the Masader Catalogue [52], Common Voice [13], Causal Conversations V2 [101] or Moments in Time [18]). Measuring geographical and linguistic representation. Naturally, we aim to use our audit to measure the progress of these efforts on geographical and linguistic representation in the AI ecosystem. We measure the progress of two forms of representation: (1) language diversity of text and speech data, and (2) geographical diversity of the creators, in all three modalities. For languages, we use the ISO 639-1 and 639-3 language codes and categories of language families from Glottolog 5.0.5 In Figure 4(a, c) we display the cumulative sum of unique languages and countries present across all audited datasets, at each time period since 2013. While these measurements illustrate the absolute rise in diversity, we also hope to measure the relative dispersion, or equality of languages and countries in the distribution. In Figure 4(b, d), we use the Gini Index [1], [2], traditional measure of statistical dispersion, frequently used to quantify inequality. This allows us to understand if the distributions of languages and creators are more representative of the international community over the last decade, or equally concentrated despite apparent efforts at the margins. 5We use top level Glottolog families. 7 The Data Provenance Initiative, Inequality in geographical representation remains very high, with few organizations creating datasets from the Global South. For every dataset, our audit recorded the organizational affiliations of each creator of the dataset.6 These organizations were then manually mapped to the country in which they are headquartered. Occasionally, organizations like BigScience, BigCode, or Masakhane have international or continental representation, and were counted as such. In Figure 3, we measure the current state of diversity among these creator organizationswhere Gini coefficient of 1 indicates highest concentration, and lower values more broad representation. Without taking up the normative question of what truly fair score would be, these values provide useful comparisons across modalities and over time. We find that Text dataset developers are particularly homogeneous, with Gini-coefficient of 0.92; followed by Speech, at 0.86 and Video at 0.74, which remain high, but are meaningfully less concentrated. Figure 3 also illustrates that even this limited diversity is still concentrated in North America, Europe, East Asia, and less so in the Global South. In Figure 3, we also compare the distribution of datasets, and of tokens or hours by continent. Dataset creators affiliated with African or South American organizations account for fewer than 0.2% of all tokens or hours, in each modality. In contrast, Asian affiliated organizations represent large proportions of the data, particularly for speech (39% of hours, attributed predominantly to YODAS [89]). Much of this driven by Chinese, Indian, Russian, and Saudi Arabian creators. Most prominently, the combination of North American and European datasets comprises 93% of text tokens, 61% of speech hours, and 60% of video hours. (a) Total Language Representation (b) Gini-coefficient for Language Representation (c) Total Geographical Representation (d) Gini-coefficient for Geographical Representation Figure 4: The cumulative totals (left) of languages and countries represented in the data over time, and the 95% confidence intervals of the gini-coefficients over time (right) to measure the representativeness of these variables. Gini-coefficients are measure of statistical dispersion, frequently used to quantify inequality. Gini coefficient of 1 indicates highest concentration, and lower values more broad representation. While the number of represented languages and geographies continue to rise (left), the equality of their distribution has in most cases, not significantly changed. Geographical representation has not significantly improved for over decade. In Figure 4(c), we measure the total unique number of countries represented across all dataset creator organizations. While individual creators will have varying ethnic and national affiliation, we treat this as an estimate for the influence of each locale in dataset development. We find that while the number of represented countries has risen steadily each year, for each modality, this represents only an illusion of progress. Empirically, the Gini coefficient for each modality has not significantly changed since the start of the period we examine in 2013. Geographic diversity has increased only among Video datasets, and these increases are not significant at the 𝑝 = 0.05 level. Text and Speech geographical representations appear to remain stable over the last decade of AI development. 6A dataset creator, following [123], is defined as an organization associated with the release of the dataset as created for machine learningnot any of the upstream sources. More details in Appendix D. 8 The Data Provenance Initiative, Multilingual representation has not improved by most measures. Similar to geographical representation, we measure the cumulative number of ISO 639-1 languages and language families over time, as well as the per-modality Gini-coefficient. Figure 4(a) shows significant increases in the number of languages available for speech and text, especially in 2019, and 2023, with the introduction of large sets like Flores [56], xP3x [98], Common Voice [13], and the Aya Collection [134]. However, once again, when measuring the cumulative dispersion of these datasets in Figure 4(b), only Text language families demonstrate any improvement from pre-2013 to the present. Improvements in the Gini coefficient appear to be largely driven by individual large-scale projects like xP3x and Common Voice, both introduced in 2019. Subsequently, newer datasets remain predominantly monolingual, causing measures of concentration in text languages, speech languages, and language families to remain consistently high. Figure 5: The distribution of creator organizations by modality. Most public speech and video datasets are developed by academic organizations, whereas text datasets are developed by wide mix of academia, non-profit or industry labs, as well as startups. Academia, research non-profits, and industry labs continue to drive public dataset development. As well as understanding the geographic associations of the organizations creating popular datasets, we manually categorize them into: Academic Organization (e.g., universities), Research Groups (e.g., non-profits such as BigScience, EleutherAI or AI2), Industry Labs (e.g., Cohere For AI, Google DeepMind), Corporations (e.g. Google, Meta), Startups (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), Governments, Unspecified (datasets where owner affiliation is not shared), or Other. When dataset is released in collaboration between organizations, we record each organization. In Figure 5, we find that universities and other academic organizations account for 16%, 47%, and 71% of all recorded dataset releases, across Text, Speech, and Video respectively. Research groups, industry labs and even corporations are also significant contributors, especially for Text datasets, where ecosystem contributors are far more distributed. The significant role of academic organizations in Video and Speech may suggest that the risk profile of releasing Text datasets differs somewhat from Video and Speech datasets, which may have more distinct privacy concerns."

            "content": "The rise of web-based, social media, and synthetic datasets may pose greater risks to privacy, copyright, and bias. Section 3.1 discusses the rise of web-based sources and particularly social media as primary sources for speech and video. Figure 1 shows these sources now exceed more traditional, curated sources such as movies, audiobooks, radio, TV, or content hand-crafted by human participantsby at least one order of magnitude. These websites made of mostly user-generated content are natural choice, given that they scale in the quantity, freshness, and heterogeneity that is best suited to train general-purpose models [70], [92]. However, prior work suggests that crowd-sourced, user-generated web content also introduces more challenges than curated content, particularly for privacy, copyright, bias, harm, and factuality. Web-based and particularly user-generated content is disproportionately likely to include personally identifiable information (PII) [40], [81], [107], and copyrighted content [16], [88]. These can be reproduced in the outputs of AI models [53], [78], creating privacy and copyright concerns [110]. Open datasets being used to train GPAI often attempt to filterbut frequently missPII and copyrighted data [107], [136] (although not all do [99]). Social media, in particular, is also known to have bias, toxicity and factuality issues [19], which can manifest in trained models, even after alignment [85]. Lastly, while synthetic data can help reduce the prevalence of PII, copyright, or bias in data, it comes with its own challenges [86], [120]. 9 The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 Social Media websites have become one of the most prominent data sources, but their Terms often restrict crawling or commercial use. We find that 71% of Video data and 69% of Speech data is from YouTube which has become prominent source of data, given its scale, freshness, and multimodality (containing videos, speech, images, and text) [4], [9], [22], [79], [89], [109]. However, YouTube is social media platform owned by Google and its Terms of Service7 prohibit third parties from crawling YouTube. While content creators maintain their ownership rights in the material they upload to YouTube, the YouTube Terms of Service also grant Google license to reproduce, modify, display, and use the content for purposes connected to YouTubes business, which may include building machine learning models; even if the copyright holder has selected permissive license, YouTubes Terms disallow external parties from crawling that data. Model developers such as Nvidia and OpenAI have been sued in the U.S. by content creators who allege that they unlawfully trained on YouTube videos [116], [135]. Large social media platforms and forums have also adopted restrictive terms in recent years, including Reddit and StackOverflow.8 As these data sources become critical to scaling AI systems, access has been made exclusive, which may hamper academic, non-profit, or open source model developmentto the extent that social media platforms can enforce their terms against third party developers.9 Ambiguous and poorly documented use restrictions may significantly inhibit model developers adhering to cautious legal and ethical data sourcing standards. In Section 3.2. we find that significant amount of data carry non-commercial restrictions in their sources, rather than on the final dataset, which can contain no license or permissive one. For text and video, these restrictions can equate to 99% of all tokens and hours. These inconsistencies are the result of datasets being iteratively re-packaged and re-licensed, without carrying on documentation [123]. While not every developer will employ the same filtering standards, our work shows that the challenges to separate and identify appropriate datasets remain difficult across these modalities. Without continued audits and documentation, practitioners may be forced to forego large collections of partially viable data, hampering data scaling laws [26], or take on avoidable risk. We hope this released audit will provide greater tools for practitioners to apply their own standards, to make informed decisions on training data use. The limitations of measures of geographical and linguistic representation. It is important to note that measures of geographical and linguistic representation are imperfect. We are limited by partial information about the developers identities (including for privacy reasons), limited transparency into how frequently these datasets are used, and the extent to which proprietary datasets may fill in representation gaps behind closed doors. Nonetheless, we believe the breadth and rigour of the audit make this the best available empirical measure of representation in publicly documented datasets. Further, we propose the goal of measuring representation in AI data as essential to understanding progress, or its absence, towards AI systems that fairly serve the broader community of users. Figure 3 and Figure 4 demonstrate that despite the absolute rise of geographical and linguistic representation, the relative western-centric concentration persists, across thousands of surveyed datasets. We release all audit materials for transparency and replicability, and for further use by the research community. Conducting representative analyses of an ecosystem comes with assumptions. First, an ecosystem for AI is by nature, not centralized or organized. Widely used datasets for Text are often hosted on Hugging Face, but this is frequently not the case for Speech or Video. Similarly, while Text data undergoes frequent dataset re-packaging for general-purpose post-training, this is not true to the same extent for other modalities. As such, the scope and dataset selection process need to be designed for each modality, rather than single, simple protocol, which inevitably will not accurately represent one modality at its ecosystem-level. Similarly, we chose subset of modalities of interest to foundation model development [104], [115], but note there are many other left for future work (e.g., images, 3D representations, tabular, time series, graphs, and geospatial data).

            "title": "A EXTENDED RELATED WORK",
            "content": "Progress in machine learning across modalities from speech [104] to vision [38] to text [21], [49] has benefited from advancements in large pre-training and fine-tuning corpora. The development of multimodal corpora has also been key to several recent advances, as with CLIP in the image/text domain [45], CLAP for audio/text settings [54], and number of other models involving both text and images, audio or video [65], [67], [104], [132]. The datasets powering these advances are not, however, always well-documented, despite the existence of standards and frameworks for recording and annotating dataset metadata that range from data statements [10] to datasheets for datasets [39] and others [17]. The key problem is not deficiency of any particular framework, but rather inconsistent adoption and fragmentation [125]. Much prior work has argued for the need to document and audit these datasets [44], [46], motivated by concerns from reproducibility [58] to interpretability [92] to bias and fairness problems that may stem from problematic content in training data [35]. There have been several attempts to carry out such audits, with prior work examining pretraining data [124], general web corpora [23], [37], instruction fine-tuning datasets [123], and the documentation fields of the HuggingFace Datasets platform in particular [139]. For speech and vision, there has been less work, with many discussions of datasets in the aggregate occurring in survey papers [3], [106], research aimed directly at improving model performance [83] or close examinations of questions like bias in small groups of datasets [12], [133]. Prior work has also examined the identities, affiliations and national origin of paper authors [128] in AI, but an analogous look at the producers of datasets is lacking. We aim to carry out such analyses: replicating those for pretraining and text finetuning datasets in video and audio domains, and surveying provenance and legal status. Finally, there has also been significant recent attention to legal questions in the collection and use of AI training data [29], [84]. The complex process involved in preparing these datasets [88], and the ambiguous licensing of inputs, can make understanding the legal status of the final output quite difficult. DATASET LICENSES & TERMS Detailed taxonomy We code the legal restrictions placed on use of datasets along two axes. First, we identify whether datasets license permits commercial use (Commercial in Table 3), only non-commercial / academic use (NC / Acad), or does not clearly specify what is permitted (Unspecified). The latter category includes datasets for which we were unable to locate license. Datasets which are in the public domain and not subject to license are counted as commercially usable. Second, we annotate the contractual or terms-of-use restrictions placed on dataset use by the source of each dataset. There are four levels, defined in Table 3. Note that the Model Closed status can only apply to datasets that are AI-generated, at least in part. Some datasets can carry both Model Closed and Source Closed status, but we count the Model Closed first for simplicity. 19 The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 Detailed breakdown Tables 3 and 4 present crosstabs of these two dimensions, according to respectively the total amount of content and the number of datasets. The most notable finding, as discussed in the main text, is the frequency of clashing restriction status between licenses and terms. By amount of content, fully 73.0% of text content, 55.0% of speech content, and 21.6% of video content is subject to license permitting commercial use but also to terms restrictions forbidding it, or the reverse. The absolute level of restrictions is also high, with < 0.1% of text content, 5.4% of speech content, and 0.6% of video content usable for commercial purposes under both licenses and terms.

            "title": "C ADDITIONAL RESULTS",
            "content": "Figures 6 and 7 report the size distributions of the datasets. We measure size differently for different types of datasets: Text datasets are in tokens, and audio/video in hours of content. The lack of standard tokenization or preprocessing schemes for those modalities makes it simplest to report raw dataset size. Notably, we find quite different size distributions by modality. The distribution of dataset sizes has the thickest right tail for text, followed by speech and then by video. Most video datasets are short in hour terms, with speech datasets tending to be somewhat longer and text datasets having greater prevalence of both very small and very large datasets relative to the mean size. Dataset tasks, meanwhile, reflect traditional approaches and research programs for each modality. Classification is the most common task for both text and video, with the video communitys longstanding interest in captioning also visible in its role as the second most common task for video datasets. Q&A occupies similar role for text, though text datasets have more balanced distribution 20 The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 LICENSE / TERMS RESTRICTED UNSPECIFIED UNRESTRICTED"

            "content": "This section provides detailed overview of the datasets we have collected and analyzed. Table 5 summarizes the text datasets, Table 6 the audio datasets, and Table 7 the video datasets. Each of these tables lists broad collections of data, sorted in chronological order, and provides information about their properties, sizes, sources and permissions. Each collection can include multiple datasets, and 21 The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 Figure 7: The task distribution of datasets, across modalities. Post-training text and video datasets are predominantly based on classification. For text, generation and reasoning are rising categories. All speech datasets are recognition-based, particularly for speaker, language, or in the process of translation. they generally reflect the ways dataset creators have grouped their datasets (such as in the same paper). Because of the large number of datasets, we provide detailed information about their licenses and original published papers, where applicable, in the supplementary Attribution Card in Appendix F. Annotation Details: Text For post-training text datasets it is common to package many together as collections, such as Flan [49] or P3 [48]. This practice is not common to the same extent for speech or video datasets. For much of the text analysis, where possible, we chose to analyze statistics at the collection-level, since practitioners are more likely to adopt collection for general-purpose posttraining, than an individual dataset within the collection. Also, in dataset-level statistics, metadata for single collection with many datasets can get repeated and overwhelm the statistics unfairly (e.g. the dataset aggregator/creator being repeated hundreds of times). Consequently, our collection-level analysis of the text modality is reflected in Figure 1, Figure 3, Figure 5, Figure 4, Figure 7, and Figure 6. However, for Figure 2 we draw the distinction between collection and dataset metrics, as practitioners may wish to unpack collections to extract only commercially licensed data. In that case Collection inherits the most restrictive license and terms of its constituent datasets. For annotating creator organizations, we follow prior works instructions [123]. For each dataset they record the affiliations listed on the academic paper or GitHub or HuggingFace object in which the dataset was released. This does not include the organizations who created or owned the sources from which the data was derived. For instance, the SQuAD dataset [5] would be associated with Stanford (the authors affiliation), but not Wikipedia, which the data was partially derived from. For dataset that has authors affiliated with multiple organizations, the dataset will be counted towards each organization. Annotation Details: Speech In many cases, multiple versions of dataset exist due to datasets being expanded or updated. In these scenarios, we used the release date from the initial version (since release dates for subsequent versions were not always clear), but used metadata from the most recently released version for which information was available to offer an overview of the current landscape of data. However, if the dataset versions could not be meaningfully aggregated (e.g. different licenses), or did not appear to be cumulatively designed (non-overlapping or otherwise semantically disjoint data), we maintained separate records. We kept only datasets for which ASR was noted as primary task. For example, if dataset was primarily intended for text-to-speech or speaker recognition, we did not keep it even if it could conceivably be repurposed for ASR. When computing hours, we excluded any hours without supervisory transcripts/scripts (unlabeled data), but kept hours with weak supervision (e.g. model-generated transcripts from speech audio). We recognize the difficulty in comprehensively covering all relevant datasets. Annotation Details: Video In video, single dataset can be re-purposed and annotated to address different tasks [18], [43]. We consider these as two different datasets even if they have the same video source since now they can be used for different computer vision tasks. 22 The Data Provenance Initiative, 2024 Table 5: Alignment tuning (text) collections and properties.
