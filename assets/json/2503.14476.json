            "content": "Test-time scaling such as OpenAIs o1 [1] and DeepSeeks R1 [2] brings profound paradigm shift to Large Language Models (LLMs) [37]. Test-time scaling enables longer Chain-of-Thought thinking and induces sophisticated reasoning behaviors, which makes the models superior in competitive math and coding tasks like AIME and Codeforces. The central technique driving the revolution is large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL), which elicits complex reasoning behaviors such as self-verification and iterative refinement. However, the actual algorithm and key recipe for scalable RL training remains myth, hidden from technical reports of existing reasoning models [1, 2, 811]. In this paper, we reveal significant obstacles in large-scale RL training and open-source scalable RL system with fully open-sourced algorithm, training code and dataset that provides democratized solutions with industry-level RL results. We experiment over Qwen2.5-32B [12] as the pretrained model for RL. In our initial GRPO run, we achieved only 30 points on AIME performance significantly below DeepSeeks RL (47 points). thorough analysis reveals that the naive GRPO baseline suffers from several key issues such as entropy collapse, reward noise, and training instability. The broader community has encountered similar challenges in reproducing DeepSeeks results [1319] suggesting that critical training details may have been omitted in the R1 paper that are required to develop an industry-level, large-scale, and reproducible RL system. To close this gap, we release an open-source state-of-the-art system for large-scale LLM RL, which achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 based on Qwen2.5-32B model, outperforming previous state-of-the-art results achieved by DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B [2] (47 points) using 50% training steps (Figure 1). We propose the Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, and introduce 4 key techniques to make RL shine in the long-CoT RL scenario. Details are presented in Section 3. 1. Clip-Higher, which promotes the diversity of the system and avoids entropy collapse; 2. Dynamic Sampling, which improves training efficiency and stability; 3. Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss, which is critical in long-CoT RL scenarios; 4. Overlong Reward Shaping, which reduces reward noise and stabilizes training. Our implementation is based on verl [20]. By fully releasing our state-of-the-art RL system including training code and data, we aim to reveal valuable insights to large-scale LLM RL that benefit the larger community."

To be exact, GRPO first calculates the mean loss within each generated sequence, before averaging the loss of different samples. As we will be discussing in Section 3.3, such difference may have an impact on the performance of the algorithm."

In the RLHF scenario [23], the goal of RL is to align the model behavior without diverging too far from the initial model. However, during training the long-CoT reasoning model, the model distribution can diverge significantly from the initial model, thus this restriction is not necessary. Therefore, we will exclude the KL term from our proposed algorithm."

            "content": "In our initial experiments using naive PPO [21] or GRPO [38], we observed the entropy collapse phenomenon: the entropy of the policy decreases quickly as training progresses (Figure 2b). The sampled responses of certain groups tend to be nearly identical. This indicates limited exploration and early deterministic policy, which can hinder the scaling process. We propose the Clip-Higher strategy to address this issue. Clipping over the importance sampling ratio is introduced in Clipped Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO-Clip) [21] to restrict the trust region and enhance the stability of RL. We identify that the upper clip can restrict the exploration of the policy. In this case, it is much easier to make an exploitation token more probable, than to uplift the probability of an unlikely exploration token. Concretely, when ε = 0.2 (the default value of most algorithms), consider two actions with probabilities πθold(oi q) = 0.01 and 0.9. The maximum possible updated probabilities πθ(oi q) are 0.012 and 1.08, respectively. This implies that for tokens with higher probability (e.g., 0.9) is less constrained. Conversely, for low-probability tokens, achieving non-trivial increase in probability is considerably more challenging. Empirically, we also observe that the maximum probability of clipped tokens is approximately πθ(oi q) < 0.2 (Figure 3a). This finding supports our analysis that the upper clipping threshold indeed restricts the probability increase of low-probability tokens, thereby potentially constraining the diversity of the system. Adhering to the Clip-Higher strategy, we decouple the lower and higher clipping range as εlow and εhigh, as 4 (a) Maximum clipped probabilities. (b) The proportion of samples with an accuracy of 1.

As shown in Figure 2, this adjustment effectively enhances the policys entropy and facilitates the generation of more diverse samples. We opt to keep εlow relatively small, because increasing it will suppress the probability of these tokens to 0, resulting in the collapse of the sampling space."

            "content": "Existing RL algorithm suffers from the gradient-decreasing problem when some prompts have accuracy equal to 1. For example for GRPO, if all outputs {oi}G of particular prompt are correct and receive the same reward 1, the resulting advantage for this group is zero. zero advantage results in no gradients for policy updates, thereby reducing sample efficiency. Empirically, the number of samples with accuracy equal to 1 continues to increase, as shown in Figure 3b. This means that the effective number of prompts in each batch keeps decreasing, which can lead to larger variance in gradient and dampens the gradient signals for model training. i=1 To this end, we propose to over-sample and filter out prompts with the accuracy equal to 1 and 0 illustrated in Equation 11, leaving all prompts in the batch with effective gradients and keeping consistent number of prompts.

            "title": "3.3 Rebalancing Act: Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss",
            "content": "The original GRPO algorithm employs sample-level loss calculation, which involves first averaging the losses by token within each sample and then aggregating the losses across samples. In this approach, each sample is assigned an equal weight in the final loss computation. However, we find that this method of loss reduction introduces several challenges in the context of long-CoT RL scenarios. Since all samples are assigned the same weight in the loss calculation, tokens within longer responses (which contain more tokens) may have disproportionately lower contribution to the overall loss, which can lead to two adverse effects. First, for high-quality long samples, this effect can impede the models ability to learn reasoning-relevant patterns within them. Second, we observe that excessively long samples often exhibit low-quality patterns such as gibberish and repetitive words. Thus, sample-level loss calculation, due to its inability to effectively penalize those undesirable patterns in long samples, leads to an unhealthy increase in entropy and response length, as shown in Figure 4a and Figure 4b. We introduce Token-level Policy Gradient Loss in the long-CoT RL scenario to address the above limitations: JDAPO(θ) = (cid:34) (q,a)D,{oi}G i=1πθold (q) (cid:88) oi (cid:88) (cid:16) (cid:80)G min 1 i=1 oi (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12){oi is_equivalent(a, oi)} (cid:12) < G. ri,t(θ) ˆAi,t, clip t=1 i=1 s.t. 0 < (cid:16) ri,t(θ), 1 εlow, 1 + εhigh (cid:17) (cid:17) ˆAi,t (cid:35) , (12) In this setting, longer sequences can have more influence on the overall gradient update compared to shorter sequences. Moreover, from the perspective of individual tokens, if particular generation pattern can lead to an increase or decrease in reward, it will be equally prompted or suppressed, regardless of the length of the response in which it appears."

By default, we assign punitive reward to truncated samples. This approach may introduce noise into the training process, as sound reasoning process can be penalized solely due to its excessive length. Such penalties can potentially confuse the model regarding the validity of its reasoning process. To investigate the impact of this reward noise, we first apply an Overlong Filtering strategy which masks the loss of truncated samples.

Therefore, the maximum number of tokens for generation is set to 20,480 tokens.

            "content": "Reinforcement learning on large language models is not only cutting-edge research direction but also an intrinsically complex systems engineering challenge, characterized by the interdependence of its various subsystems. Modifications to any single subsystem can propagate through the system, leading to unforeseen consequences due to the intricate interplay among these components. Even seemingly minor changes in initial conditions, such as variations in data and hyperparameters, can amplify through iterative reinforcement learning processes, yielding substantial deviations in outcomes. This complexity often confronts researchers with dilemma: even after meticulous analysis and well-founded expectations that modification will enhance specific aspects of the training process, the actual results frequently diverge from the anticipated trajectory. Therefore, monitoring of key intermediate results during experimentation is essential for swiftly identifying the sources of discrepancies and, ultimately, for refining the system. The Length of Generated Responses is metric closely related to training stability and performance, as shown in Figure 7a. The increase in length provides the model with larger space for exploration, allowing more complex reasoning behaviors to be sampled and gradually reinforced through training. However, it is important to note that length does not always maintain continuous upward trend during training. In some considerable periods, it can exhibit trend of stagnation or even decline, which has also been demonstrated in [2]. We typically use length in conjunction with validation accuracy as indicators to assess whether an experiment is deteriorating. The Dynamics of Reward during training has always been one of the crucial monitoring indicators in reinforcement learning, as shown in Figure 7b. In the majority of our experiments, the trend of reward increase is relatively stable and does not fluctuate or decline significantly due to adjustments in experimental settings. This indicates that, given reliable reward signal, language models can robustly fit the distribution of training set. However, we find that the final reward on the training set often exhibits little correlation with the accuracy on the validation set, which indicates overfitting to the training set. The Entropy of the Actor Model and Generation Probability are related to the models exploration capability and are key metrics that we closely monitor in our experiments. Intuitively, the models 9 (a) Mean response length. (b) Reward score. (c) Generation entropy. (d) Mean probability. Figure 7 The metric curves of response length, reward score, generation entropy, and the mean probability of DAPO, which show the dynamics of RL training and serve as essential monitoring indicators to identify potential issues. entropy needs to be maintained within an appropriate range. An excessively low entropy indicates that the probability distribution is overly sharp, leading to loss of exploration capability. Conversely, an excessively high entropy is often associated with issues of over-exploration such as gibberish and repetitive generation. For the generation probability, the situation is exactly the opposite. As demonstrated in Section 3.1, by applying the Clip-Higher strategy, we effectively addressed the issue of entropy collapse. In subsequent experiments, we find that maintaining slow upward trend in entropy is conducive to the improvement of model performance, shown in Figure 7c and Figure 7d."

This finding reveals the adaptability and exploration capability of RL algorithms and offers new insights into the learning mechanisms of the model. For example, in the early stages of model training, there was virtually no occurrence of checking and reflecting on previous reasoning steps. However, as training progresses, the model exhibits distinct behaviors of reflection and backtracking, as shown in Table 2. This observation sheds light on further exploration into interpreting the emergence of reasoning abilities during RL, which we leave for future research. 10 Question: Given that the base ABC of the tetrahedron ABC is an equilateral triangle, the projection of point on the face SBC is the orthocenter of SBC, the dihedral angle AB is 30, and SA = 2, find the volume of the tetrahedron. The answer is in the form , so give the value of + m. Response: Let us consider the given problem: We need to determine ... ... Next, let have coordinates (x0, y0, z0). (cid:112)(x0)2 + (y0)2 + (z0)2 = 2, so we can write x2 the orthogonal projection of ... However, wait moment, lets rethink about the dihedral angle involving planes in more thoughtful geometric way. Consider the plane α1 = ABC, which lies entirely on the xy coordinate plane (as = 0). Let the plane α2 = SBC. The point projected perpendicularly to plane α2 lands on H. The line = AB ... ... Since SA = 2, the distance formula gives us 0 = 4. Now, remember that is 0 + 0 + y2 Table 2 Emergence of Reflective Behavior in Reinforcement Learning"

To ensure the model can complete this task with high accuracy, our goal is to have it perform comprehensive reasoning while avoiding hallucinations. We achieve this by providing clear thinking framework that encourages thorough reasoning. Specifically, we employ Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning along with four well-defined steps: extract the answer format, rewrite the problem statement, solve the modified problem and provide an integer as the final answer. For each step, we provide few-shot solutions or detailed guidelines to guide the models reasoning. Through this approach, we have observed that in most cases, the LLM can generate reformulations with both format and quality that are satisfactory.

Answer: 19 Models output (Markdown Text) Transformation Thought Process The original answer to the problem is an algebraic expression 11 2 6. We need to transform this into an integer form. First, note that the answer consists of an integer part and square root term. According to the given rule, we replace the integer and square root components with undetermined coefficients. The original problem uses and as variables, so we choose other letters as undetermined coefficients. We express the answer in the form and require the student to find + + n.

In addition, each of the 900 residents owns bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things. Response: Step by Step Solution: 1. Lets define the following variables: Let be the set of residents who own diamond ring. Let be the set of residents who own set of golf clubs. Let be the set of residents who own garden spade. Let be the set of residents who own bag of candy hearts. Since all 900 residents own bag of candy hearts, = 900. Let ai denote the number of residents who own exactly out of the 4 items. Lets use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the union of 4 sets A, B, C, D. ... a4 = 219 Since a4, the number of people owning all four items, must be whole number, our current approach needs to be reconsidered in terms of the combinatorial counting of people owning different combinations of the items. Instead of directly using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can use different approach involving the number of people owning combinations of the items A, B, C, and D. Let xi be the number of people owning exactly item among A, B, (excluding the item which everyone owns). Then the total number of people owning exactly items among the A, B, C, and can be broken down: ... 4 = 54.75. 4 = 219 Table 3 case of reflective behavior emergence."
