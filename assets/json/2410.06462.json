Keywords: large language models, LLM, cybersecurity, hallucinations, attack surface, supply chain attack Introduction Recent research in cybersecurity, artificial intelligence (AI), and software supply chain vulnerabilities has highlighted the growing complexity and impact of attacks on digital systems and AI-based technologies. The present work highlights novel dangers posed by automated programming interfaces or hybrid scenarios that leverage the software supply chain, particularly in copy-paste or rapid development sprints. Several studies focus on the threat landscape within the supply chain domain, identifying the rising number of attacks targeting popular software packages and development environments (Andreoli et al. 2023). To frame this challenging vulnerability, it is essential to understand the rapidly evolving nature of large language models (LLMs) and the implications of mixture of experts (MoE) in scaling up their changing contexts. Such shifts of user contexts can reveal behaviors in foundational models that are otherwise hidden, particularly when switching between expert domains that unlock different, harmful, or unanticipated capabilities. This transition highlights the current problem statement: as LLMs attempt to be universally applicable, do they expose vulnerabilities when context-specific guardrails are insufficiently trained or inadequately enforced, allowing unintended behaviors to emerge? We focus on the coding assistant role and suggest novel attack frameworks for general assessment of LLM vulnerabilities to respond with more information than their traditional guardrails might suggest. framing example asks LLM to deliver ransomware (which it refuses), then to embed contextual cue that asks for public repository to deliver the same ransomware (which it accepts) and delivers code to magnify the damage in semi-automated update or vast digital supply chain endpoints like GitHub, NPM, NuGet, and fake or hallucinated example APIs and CDNs that determined threat actor hijacks. Similarly, when asked to design fake login page, the foundational models refuse this request as harmful behavior. But when asked the same question as part of programming challenge in HTML, however, the LLM provides code in test case to mimic the PayPal website. Previous Work Foundational LLM safety teams focus on four primary threats including cybersecurity (e.g. authoring zeroday attacks), biology (e.g. generating novel viruses or chemical agents), deception (e.g. manipulating humans), and model autonomy (e.g., acquiring emergent or unintended skills). The cornerstone scenario of rogue LLM involves an unintended consequence of surfing vast programming repository like GitHub and learning some previously unknown but deceptive threat and magnifying it at scale to unassuming users while acting as helpful code assistant. In this hypothetical case, the LLM is the bootloader to global malware outbreaks. One may question the efficacy of current safeguards against such red teaming scenario and LLM foundational models hosted by Open AI, Google, or Anthropic (along with fine-tuned small language models trained to exploit these scenarios). Figure 1. Formal dictionary or ontology of cybersecurity supply chain concerns with LLMs. The studied element (R) include threat actor (A) exploiting source (B) to provide programming patterns (C) that otherwise the foundational model would not provide. This study focuses on cybersecurity risks to the digital supply chain, examples which corrupt the code source of popular libraries, APIs, or update repositories. For cataloguing and assessing the risk of this attack surface, the study presents empirical exploits that force LLMs to suggest harmful actions or toxic statements that their traditional guardrails block. While not jailbreaking in the traditional sense, these examples collect useful side-channels to LLM leakage that enable unintended prompt-response cycles for code developers. Figure 1 summarizes potential attack surface ontology of determined and malicious actor to exploit LLM behavior to harmful cybersecurity outcomes. Research Question The current study examines the topical cybersecurity challenge in the software supply chain: what is the risk of introducing copied or hallucinated recommendations for malicious code into popular code repositories? Foundational models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have implemented guardrails against harmful behaviors; however, these measures vary across different contexts, especially where the models serve as mixtures of experts (Masoudnia, et al. 2014). Previous research indicates that while these models may correctly filter direct prompts with toxic intent, the embedded contexts within seemingly innocuous programming challenges can bypass safety mechanisms. The present work seeks to understand if foundational models (that are broadly resistant to proposing destructive actions when addressed directly) can be compromised into advising harmful software practices. In other words, when risky suggestion gets framed within technical challenge or programming scenario, do the LLMs provide responses that drop their safety guard and suggest risky practices or reveal security weaknesses. This is tested empirically through examples involving trojan-hosting repositories such as GitHub, NPM, NuGet, and content delivery networks (CDN). Results and Discussion Appendix highlights the results across range of programming recommendations that reference or direct the user to apply malicious supply chain endpoints. These endpoints include major coding libraries known to be compromised along with non-library source list traditional blacklisted URLs. The specific scenarios discovered range from the suggestion of compromised API endpoints and hijacked RSS feeds to the recommendation of malicious GitHub repositories and npm packages. The Appendix also demonstrates more subtle attack methods, such as iframe-based attacks loading content from blacklisted domains and CDN-based attacks utilizing obfuscated malicious payloads in minified code. Language-specific package managers like Python's PIP, Ruby's bundler, and Rust's Cargo are also found to be potential injection points in the software supply chain for malicious library installations. Attack Vector Malicious API Endpoints LLM suggests fake OCR API that triggers malware downloads Example Potential Impact Compromised RSS Feeds LLM recommends altered antivirus RSS feed Malicious GitHub Clone Repositories LLM suggests cloning compromised \"chatgpt-api\" repo Malicious NPM and yarn Packages Iframe-based Attacks CDN-based Attacks Fake Login Attacks LLM recommends using \"@realtyfront/codegen\" package, radar-cms package LLM provides code for iframe loading malicious URLs LLM suggests using compromised jQuery from CDN LLM refuses to suggest Paypal clone but designs the login page as HTML programming problem Widespread malware distribution through seemingly legitimate API calls Potential for mass distribution of malicious content to subscribers Propagation of crypto stealers and token grabbers in developer environments System information theft and potential for further malware deployment Stealthy loading of malicious content, potential for DDOS participation Exfiltration of form data, including login credentials and sensitive information Phishing starter for harmful behaviors that LLM guardrails drop Attack Vector Malicious Python pip Library Attacks Malicious Ruby Gemfile Library Attacks Malicious Rust Cargo Library Attacks Example Potential Impact LLM suggests using compromised \"fatnoob\" from Python Package Index (PyPI), the official third-party software repository for Python LLM suggests using compromised \"atlas-client\" from RubyGems, the official third-party software repository for Ruby LLM suggests using compromised \"xrvrv\" from Rust Crates.io, the official third-party software repository for Rust Exfiltration of local data as W4SP Stealer Trojan executables often disguised as PNG rather than EXE file extension Attacker sends victim's information about the target back to Telegram channel they are monitoring Table 1. Summary of Attack Scenarios using LLM Recommendations for Programming Supply Chain Insertions Table 1 encapsulates the core findings from the Appendix, presenting each attack vector with concrete example and its potential impact. The examples demonstrate how LLMs could inadvertently recommend various types of attacks that reference compromised or malicious resources. The potential impacts highlight the supply-chain consequences these vulnerabilities could have if exploited at scale either by forking repositories, typo-squatting on existing libraries, or upgrading weaponized software dependency. The implications of these dependencies (as vulnerable injection points) grow as the software development industry increasingly relies on AI-assisted coding and recommendations. Not only do the foundational models violate their companies own safety guards when given out-of-context requests, these supply chain attack vectors have already compromised multiple libraries, potentially affecting multiple applications and operating systems. The straightforward example of this lowered safety guard is the refusal of GPT-4o to assist in authoring fake login page as unacceptable but proceed to build PayPal phishing page when asked for HTML programming assistance. The bulk of the demonstrations feature supply chain injection where the LLM is simply exploitable as recommender system to known malicious libraries in its suggested code. One analogy to consider is whether search engine like Google should filter blacklisted websites in search results to save the naïve user from clicking on them, but helpful AI assistant can alternatively recommend software dependencies without any concern for its own blacklist safety requirements. An innocent user placing their trust in LLM recommendations could be weaponized against developers, turning tool meant to enhance productivity into trojan horse for malware and data exfiltration. To realize the latter case in the wild, the malicious creator of the library referenced in popular LLM response would likely have some prior use of typo-squatting domains from their known uses of typo-squatting library names like colourspaces vs. colorspace. notable aspect of these findings is how the LLMs' directive to be helpful inadvertently supports potential threat actors. For instance, the models may recommend application programming interface (API) endpoints that domain-squatter could exploit, setting up infrastructure that weaponizes the copied code. This situation draws parallel to \"living off the land\" attackswhere benign elements are repurposed for malicious intentby demonstrating how foundational language models can recommend actions violating safety policies without explicitly dangerous prompts. This novel attack vector underlines the need for enhancing context-aware safety measures in LLMs, especially as the complexity and diversity of their applications continue to grow. Survey of Previous Related Work Our findings on LLMs' potential to recommend malicious resources in software development contexts build upon and extend existing research in AI security and software supply chain vulnerabilities. The ability of LLMs to suggest compromised API endpoints, RSS feeds, and GitHub repositories aligns with the software supply chain attack concerns raised by Andreoli et al. (2023) and Martínez and Durán (2021). Their analysis of the SolarWinds case demonstrates how trusted infrastructures can be exploited, scenario our research suggests could be unintentionally facilitated by LLMs in development environments. The vulnerability of LLMs recommending malicious NPM packages relates to the frequent automated acceptance of library dependencies in active projects, as observed in JavaScript frameworks. This risk is amplified by the minified and often obfuscated nature of NPM code, practice noted by Hammi, Zeadally, and Nebhen (2023) in their overview of digital supply chain threats. Our exploration of iframe-based and CDN-based attacks facilitated by LLM recommendations extends the work of Bethany et al. (2024) and Chowdhury et al. (2024) on LLM vulnerabilities. These attack vectors represent new dimension in the challenges facing AI-assisted development, where the trust placed in AI assistants could be exploited to introduce vulnerabilities. The observed ability of LLMs to bypass their own safety measures in programming contexts extends the research on LLM jailbreaking by Jiang et al. (2024), Xu et al. (2024), and Yong et al. (2023). Our findings suggest that code generation contexts might serve as novel form of jailbreaking, allowing LLMs to recommend potentially harmful actions they would otherwise avoid. The \"hallucinations\" in LLMgenerated code recommendations, particularly in suggesting non-existent or potentially malicious resources, align with the concerns raised by Liu et al. (2024) and Spracklen et al. (2024). These hallucinations represent significant risk in AI-assisted programming, potentially introducing vulnerabilities that are difficult to detect through traditional code review processes. These results also relate to the work of Koutsokostas and Patsakis (2021) on developing stealth malware without obfuscation, and Karantzas and Patsakis (2021) on evaluating endpoint detection systems. The ability of LLMs to suggest seemingly innocuous code that could harbor malicious intent presents similar challenges to cybersecurity systems and human code reviewers. The potential for LLMs to facilitate \"living off the land\" style attacks, as implied by our findings, connects with the work of Adobe's Security Intelligence team (2021) on classifying such techniques. Our research suggests that LLMs could inadvertently become vector for these types of attacks in software development workflows, concern also raised by Hartmann and Steup (2020) in their exploration of AI system hijacking. Considering these connections, these novel attacks underscore the need for more robust security measures in AI-assisted programming. The work on red teaming strategies by Deng et al. (2023) and Thompson and Sklar (2024) could be extended to address the vulnerabilities we've identified in code-generation contexts. Furthermore, the ALERT benchmark proposed by Tedeschi et al. (2024) could be adapted to include scenarios that test LLMs' ability to maintain security awareness in programming tasks. As the software community continues to integrate AI into development processes, addressing these vulnerabilities will be important. The continued monitoring of malicious software packages, as detailed by Phylum (2024), further underscores the importance of proactive security measures in the face of evolving threats in AI-assisted software development. Conclusions and Future Work This research has collected potential vulnerabilities in the integration of large language models (LLMs) into software development workflows. Our findings suggest that while LLMs from foundational providers like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have strong safeguards against overtly harmful behaviors, these protections may be inadvertently bypassed in specific contexts, particularly when offering programming assistance. The demonstrated ability to introduce potentially malicious code recommendations through context-shifting reveals novel gap in current LLM safety measures. This vulnerability magnifies its importance in more automated or hybrid workflows, which depend heavily on widespread use of code repositories like GitHub, package managers such as NPM and NuGet, and content delivery networks like jsDelivr, all of which could amplify the impact of such attacks. Future work should focus on several key areas: 1. Comprehensive evaluation of LLM behavior across diverse programming contexts to identify potential weak points in their safety mechanisms. 2. Development of more sophisticated context-aware safeguards that maintain vigilance even when the conversation topic shifts abruptly. 3. Creation of tools and methodologies to detect and mitigate potential security risks in LLMgenerated code recommendations. 4. Investigation into the prevalence and impact of \"living off the land\" style attacks facilitated by LLM recommendations in real-world development environments. 5. Exploration of methods to enhance LLM understanding of secure coding practices and the ability to recognize potentially malicious patterns in recommended resources or code snippets. In conclusion, this research underscores the double-edged nature of AI assistance in programming. While LLMs offer potential to enhance developer productivity, they also introduce new attack vectors that must be managed. The ability of these models to unwittingly recommend actions that violate their intended safety policies when presented in the context of coding support requests is new guardrail to support. As we continue to integrate AI into software development processes, more work is needed to quantify the prevalence of these vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios and to develop effective mitigation strategies. Given the complex and hidden nature of current foundational models, future efforts may involve enhancing the security or black-list awareness of LLMs, implementing more vetting processes for AI-recommended resources, and creating tools to detect potential security risks in LLM outputs. The findings also underscore the importance of ongoing education for developers about the potential risks associated with copy-paste cycles with AI-assisted coding and the need for critical evaluation of AI-generated recommendations in most hybrid programming models.
