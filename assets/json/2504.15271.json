Links: Project Page 1. Introduction Despite the significant advances in multimodal learning Bai et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023); Li et al. (2023,); Wang et al. (2024), many visionlanguage models (VLMs) remain focused on shortcontext tasks, with long-context understanding under-explored. This gap is particularly evident in both long video comprehension and highresolution image/video understanding, where the processing of extended visual contexts remains an open challenge. Such extended contexts encompass multiple images, extended video sequences, high-resolution media, or combinations thereof. However, the development of long-context VLMs is still in its early stages, hindered by fundamental challenges in dataset construction, architecture design, training strategies, and computation/memory bottlenecks. Figure 1: Performance comparison of Eagle 2.5 with leading vision-language models on the Video-MME benchmark. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates consistent improvement as the number of input frames increases. To enable long-context visual understanding, several approaches have been proposed to address the challenge of processing extended visual inputs by designing specialized compression or selection modules Jin et al. (2024); Korbar et al. (2024); Li et al. (2023,, 2024); Shen et al. (2024); Weng et al. (2024); Yu et al. (2024).

Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models to extend the context length of VLMs, they often introduce additional computational overhead or capacity limitations, potentially constraining model performance. promising research direction is to extend the context length of LLMs to enable native long-context understanding. While prior studies Shen et al. (2025); Xue et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024) have explored this direction, challenges and key limitations still remain. First, the performance of existing methods is often suboptimal, generally falling behind proprietary models. Second, these approaches struggle to achieve consistent improvements as the amount of visual input increases. Lastly, the optimal training strategies for state-of-the-art long-context VLMs remain unclear, given the complex interplay of factors such as training strategies and data recipes. To this end, we present Eagle 2.5, versatile multimodal model designed to efficiently process extensive contextual information. Unlike models solely optimized for handling long multimodal sequences without improving performance, Eagle-2.5 benefits from increased input length, leading to consistent performance gains besides merely accommodating longer inputs. As shown in Fig. 1, our model achieves superior context coverage and exhibits consistent performance scaling with increasing frame counts. Notably, it attains competitive results compared to larger models such as GPT-4o OpenAI (2023) and Qwen2.5-VL-72B Bai et al. (2025), while maintaining significantly smaller parameter footprint. Eagle 2.5 is driven by both the advanced training strategy and data recipe. For training strategy, we introduce two core components for effective long-context learning: information-first sampling and progressive training. Information-first sampling. The information-first sampling strategy ensures the preservation of essential visual and semantic information through two mechanisms: (1) Image Area Preservation, which optimizes tiling to retain the majority of the original image area while maintaining aspect ratio fidelity, avoiding rigid aspect ratio constraints; and (2) Automatic Degradation Sampling (ADS), which dynamically balances visual and textual inputs by prioritizing complete text retention while adaptively optimizing visual content to maximize context length utilization and preserve multimodal information. Progressive training. We employ progressive mixed post-training approach, wherein context length is incrementally expanded during training, enhancing the models ability to process inputs of varying sizes. This integrated strategy significantly improves information density over static sampling methods while ensuring consistent performance across diverse input types and lengths. For data recipe, we embrace the diversity first, then quality principle in curating the training data pool. Our data recipe combines open-source data (including human-annotated data as well as synthetic video data) with our self-curated Eagle-Video-110K dataset, specifically designed to enhance long video understanding capabilities. We adopt diversity-driven collection strategy, using multiple video sources and similarity thresholding method to identify novel clips that maximize content diversity. Our dataset is distinguished by its dual annotation approach: top-down story-level method that leverages human-annotated chapters as meaningful segments instead of traditional shot-level segmentation, producing dense captions that form the basis for comprehensive long-form QA pairs capturing the entire videos narrative structure; complementary bottom-up clip-level approach that generates focused QA pairs for short clips using GPT-4o with diverse question types. To address the challenge of extending localized clip annotations to full-length videos, we implement anchors that incorporates temporal references and contextual elements without revealing answers, thereby letting models understand both overarching narratives and precise spatio-temporal details within videos. Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models 2. Related Work Vision-language models. Advancements in large language models (LLMs) Achiam et al. (2023); Dubey et al. (2024); OpenAI (2023) have significantly propelled visual understanding by integrating visual features, leading to the creation of Visual Language Models (VLMs) Li et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023); OpenAI (2023); Zhu et al. (2024). Open-source VLMs Dai et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024,); Liu et al. (2023, 2024, 2025); Team (2024); Wang et al. (2024) continue to achieve breakthroughs, often matching or exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4V/4o OpenAI (2023) and Gemini-1.5 Reid et al. (2024). The release of open-source VLMs IDEFICS (2023); Li et al. (2024); Tong et al. (2024), complete with its training data and code base, has further accelerated research in this area. However, most current VLMs primarily focus on short-context understanding, handling only few images or short video clips at time. Eagle 2.5 advances this field by concentrating on long-context visual understanding through comprehensive exploration and development of training strategies and data recipes. Long-context VLMs. Long-context VLMs were developed to address the challenges of processing large multimodal sequences. Currently, methods for long-context VLMs fall into two main categories. The first category involves specialized modules designed for context compression. Question-guided compressions Korbar et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024); Shen et al. (2024) or selection Li et al. (2025); Yu et al. (2023, 2024) methods extract question-related visual cues through an additional module, while various token reduction techniques Jin et al. (2024); Li et al. (2023, 2024); Wang et al. (2024); Weng et al. (2024); Yu et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024) aim to minimize the visual representation before LLM processing. The other category attempts to directly extend the context of LLMs. Works like LongVA Zhang et al. (2024), LongVILA Xue et al. (2024), and LongViTA Shen et al. (2025) directly extend the context length of LLMs to accommodate longer multimodal sequences. While promising, these approaches often underperform proprietary models, fail to show consistent performance improvements with increasing visual input, and have underexplored constraints on training strategies and data recipes. Our approach focuses on developing native long-context capabilities that enhance VLMs by exploring training data, formulations, and without introducing additional compression modules or suffering from performance inconsistencies observed in previous expansion attempts. Long-context multimodal data. To enhance VLMs long-context multimodal understanding capabilities, various datasets have been proposed. Some datasets focus on multimodal understanding of long documents Pramanick et al. (2025); Tanaka et al. (2023); Tito et al. (2023); Van Landeghem et al. (2023), such as slides and papers. However, they often lack temporal understanding. Other datasets Ghermi et al. (2025); Huang et al. (2020); Rawal et al. (2024); Song et al. (2024,); Wu and Krahenbuhl (2021); Yue et al. (2023, 2024) emphasize the temporal coherence and information retrieval across long spans inherent in movies. Additionally, recent datasets Chen et al. (2024); Han et al. (2023); Miech et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2024) covering domains further enhance VLMs long-context multimodal understanding. Regarding the annotation methods for longcontext multimodal datasets, early works Huang et al. (2020); Miech et al. (2019); Song et al. (2024); Tanaka et al. (2023); Tito et al. (2023); Van Landeghem et al. (2023)relied on manual efforts. To reduce costs, some methods Chen et al. (2024); Ghermi et al. (2025); Han et al. (2023); Pramanick et al. (2025); Rawal et al. (2024); Song et al. (2024); Yue et al. (2023, 2024); Zhang et al. (2024) use tools like GPT-4V OpenAI (2023) and Gemini Team et al. (2023) for automated or semi-automated annotation. Recent advancements in data construction emphasize hierarchical annotation strategies Han et al. (2023), which can preserve narrative structure in long videos. These advancements reflect trend towards creating balanced datasets that effectively assess long-context multimodal understanding while managing creation costs. 3. Eagle 2.5 In this section, we present Eagle 2.5 from three parts: model architecture, training strategies, and data recipe. 3.1. Model Architecture 3 Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models We design our proposed model as versatile multimodal system capable of efficiently processing long-context information, rather than specialized model solely optimized for handling extended multimodal inputs. To ensure adaptability and generalization across diverse tasks, we deliberately avoid incorporating tailored compression modules that might constrain the models flexibility. Following the architecture of LLaVA Liu et al. (2023), we employ an MLP projection layer to align vision embeddings from SigLIP Zhai et al. (2023) with the LLM representation space, as shown in Fig. 2. In this work, we utilize the Qwen2.5 series models Team (2024). To effectively handle any-resolution images, we adopt the image tiling strategy, inspired by LLaVA-1.5 Liu et al. (2024) and InternVL Chen et al. (2023). Figure 2: Tiling-based general multimodal system. 3.2. Training Strategy Our approach contains two key components to achieve effective long-context training: first, an information-first sampling strategy that establishes optimal sampling criteria; and second, progressive training schedule based on this strategy, which directs the entire model training process. 3.2.1. Information-First Sampling In multimodal training, the sampling of visual content is essential. Multi-image documents typically comprise dozens of pages with ultra-high-resolution images, while video content can vary drastically in length - from mere seconds to hours. To effectively manage this diversity, we present information-first sampling to promote information preservation from both visual and semantic dimensions. Image area preservation (IAP). Traditional tiling methods divide an image of size 𝑊 𝐻 into rigid 𝑟𝑤 𝑟ℎ grid of 𝑠 𝑠 tiles. While effective for handling high-resolution inputs, these approaches often distort the original image geometry through improper aspect ratio handling. For example, InternVL Chen et al. (2023) imposes strict aspect ratio constraints that force image downsampling, undermining the purpose of tiling. To address this, we propose an area-prioritized tiling strategy that optimizes two key objectives: Area Preservation: Encourage maintaining at least 60% of the original area (𝐴orig = 𝑊 𝐻) in the tiled version (𝐴new = 𝑟𝑤𝑟ℎ𝑠2). Aspect Ratio Fidelity: Align the tiling ratio 𝑟𝑡 = 𝑟𝑤/𝑟ℎ with the original aspect ratio 𝑟orig = 𝑊/𝐻. Figure 3: Image area preservation. Compared to the tiling strategy (a) from InternVL Team (2024), our method (b) effectively retains larger portion of the original image, especially for high-resolution inputs. This ensures that more comprehensive visual information is preserved, benefiting tasks that require fine-grained details. For candidate tiling ratios {(𝑟𝑤, 𝑟ℎ) 𝑟𝑤 𝑟ℎ 𝑁 }, we select the optimal configuration by: arg max (𝑟𝑤,𝑟ℎ) min ) , 0. ( 𝐴new 𝐴orig Area penalty ) min ( 𝑟𝑡 𝑟orig Aspect ratio alignment 𝑟orig 𝑟𝑡 , (1) This formulation imposes penalties when 𝐴new < 0.6𝐴orig but avoids over-rewarding configurations where 𝐴new > 0.6 𝐴orig. The aspect ratio term reaches maximum value 1 when 𝑟𝑡 = 𝑟orig, decaying symmetrically 4 Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models for deviations. comparison between the strategies is shown in Fig. 3. Automatic degradation sampling. VLMs require careful allocation of sequence length budgets between visual and textual inputs. Conventional vision-context-centric approaches sample visual content (e.g., video frames) at fixed rates or with predetermined counts, risking text truncation and suboptimal token allocation. We propose Automatic Degradation Sampling (ADS), an all-context-centric strategy that dynamically optimizes this balance. Given training sample 𝒮 = {𝑆visual, 𝑆text} with max sequence length ℒmax, where 𝑆visual contains arbitrary combinations of images, videos, and multi-page documents: 1. Compute fixed text token length ℒtext. 2. Derive fixed visual token budget: ℒvisual = ℒmax ℒtext. Thus, we keep the complete textual information by constricting the visual token budget. For visual content optimization under ℒvisual, we distinguish two types and optimize two key variables: Images: Optimize maximal tile count per image 𝑡 to maximize spatial information of 𝑀 images. Temporal content (videos/documents): Optimize sampling count 𝑛 to maximize temporal coverage. The constrained optimization problem is formulated as: maximize 𝑡,𝑛 subject to 𝑀 𝑖= 𝑀 𝑖=1 𝐿(𝑡, 𝐼𝑖) + 256 𝑛 𝐿(𝑡, 𝐼𝑖) + 256 𝑛 ℒvis (2) 1 𝑡 12, { 𝑁max = 1 𝑛 𝑁max 2 duration (video) pages (document) Where optimization variables are the tile count per image (𝑡) and temporal sampling count (𝑛), with fixed parameters including: total image instances 𝑀 (calculated from input), token function 𝐿(𝑡, 𝐼𝑖) used to calculate the tokens of 𝑖-th image 𝐼𝑖 under maximal tiling number 𝑡, predefined upper bounds 𝑇max = 12 (max tiles per image) and 𝑁max = 2 duration/1 pages (video/doc constraints). For temporal content, we do not use image tiling, thus the token quantity per temporal unit (frame/page) is 𝐿(1, ) = 256. Given that training samples typically exhibit mutually exclusive composition (predominantly images or temporal content), ADS employs dual-phase degradation process to address the above optimization problem: Temporal degradation: Initially, we fix the max tile number 𝑡 = 1 and focus on temporal sampling. We target sampling rate of 2 FPS for videos, and the usage of all images for multi-image documents. We also require that each visual input has at least 𝑁min frames; if this minimum cannot be met within the visual context budget, the sample is discarded. Formally, the maximally sampled temporal units is: 𝑛* = ℒvisual 𝑀 256 Tiling degradation: After deciding the number of frames, we dynamically adjust the tiling to maximize the use of available context. Let 𝒯 = {12, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1} represent the possible tile configurations in decreasing Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models order. We choose the highest tile configuration 𝑡* such that: { 𝑡* = max 𝑡 𝒯 : 𝑚 𝑖=1 𝐿(𝑡, 𝐼𝑖) (ℒ𝑉 𝑛* 256) } This strategy preserves as much visual detail as possible while ensuring the full textual input is retained, thereby optimizing the overall learning signal. This dual-phase approach guarantees complete text preservation while dynamically adapting visual resolution to available context budget, achieving superior information density compared to static sampling strategies. 3.2.2. Post-Training Schedule We introduce comprehensive post-training framework consisting of two complementary strategies. First, we establish foundational mixed post-training approach, upon which we develop an enhanced progressive mixed post-training strategy to substantially improve model performance across varying context lengths. Mixed post-training. Since the model needs to efficiently process multimodal inputs of diverse lengths, maintaining consistent performance across variable context sizes is essential. Our ADS method adaptively adjusts each training sample to the maximum sequence length ℒmax, providing frame-agnostic training paradigm. We implement mixed training strategy with length-balanced packing Authors (2025) to optimize performance uniformly across the entire spectrum of context lengths. Progressive mixed post-training. For scenarios with large ℒmax values, balancing the distribution of long and short sequences becomes computationally intensive, and achieving optimal performance through single training iteration proves challenging. To address this limitation, we propose progressive mixed training methodology that gradually exposes the model to increasingly larger ℒmax values, systematically enhancing its capacity to process extended contexts. Compared to conventional mixed training, our method more effectively preserves the models capabilities across different sequence lengths while safely generating diverse model variants at intermediate training stages. In our exeriment, we sequentially set ℒmax to 32K, 64K and 128K. 3.3. Data Recipe Our data recipe begins with open-source data. We embrace the diversity first, then quality principle and gather data from various open sources. This data mainly comprises high-definition multi-image/short videos, long videos, multi-page documents, and extensive text data. We also find that current open-source video data often lacks sufficient length. We thus propose novel dataset, Eagle-Video-110K, to complement the length, as shown in Fig. 4. 3.3.1. Open-Source Long-Context Data models capability is intrinsically linked to the diversity of its training data. Therefore, gathering the most diverse data possible represents fundamental principle of this work, leading to two main strategies: Human-annotated Data: We integrate various open-source human-annotated datasets, including established video and image-document collections such as COIN Tang et al. (2019) and SlideVQA Tanaka et al. (2023), which can be directly considered as high-quality data. Synthetic Video Data: Considering that videos naturally contain long-context information, we incorporate open-source synthetic video data, such as LLaVA-Video Zhang et al. (2024). These datasets are primarily annotated automatically using state-of-the-art models including GPT-4V/4o OpenAI (2023,?), Claude3 Anthropic (2024), and Gemini-1.5 Pro Reid et al. (2024). Combined with short-context data, all collected open-source datasets are summarized in Tab. 1. For convenience, we refer to this collective dataset as Open-Data. 6 Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models Category Video Classification Temporal Action Localization Video Temporal Grounding Dense Video Captioning Temporal Segmentation Temporal Reasoning General Video QA Multi-Page Document Video Captioning Long Text Dataset Kinetics710 Carreira and Zisserman (2017); Wang et al.

(2024) Table 1: Video, multi-page document, and long text dataset used in Eagle-2.5. 3.3.2. Eagle-Video-110K We curate Eagle-Video-110K to enhance long video understanding capabilities. Specifically, we first collect videos using diversity-driven strategy. We then automatically annotate these videos using both top-down and bottom-up approaches to generate comprehensive story-level and fine-grained clip-level annotations, as shown in Fig. 5. Diversity-driven video collection. We utilize several data sources for our video collection: Vidchapters Yang et al. (2023), MiraData Ju et al. (2025), InternVid-10M Wang et al. (2024), Panda-70M Chen et al. (2024), Vript Yang et al. (2025), Shot2story Han et al. (2023), ViTT Huang et al. (2020), and WebVid10M Bain et al. (2021), collectively referred to as 𝐴. Our approach prioritizes diversity, focusing on gathering wide range of video content. For the current training dataset 𝐵, we use CLIP Radford et al. (2021) to extract temporal features at rate of 1 frame per second. Videos from both 𝐴 and 𝐵 are segmented into 10-second clips. We perform pooling operation on each clips frames to derive representative feature vector. Let {𝑏𝑖}𝑁𝐵 𝑖=1 and {𝑎𝑗}𝑁𝐴 𝑗=1 For each clip 𝑎𝑗 in 𝐴, we identify its maximum similarity with any clip in 𝐵: Figure 4: Comparison of video duration between open-source data and Eagle-Video-110K. represent the clips from 𝐵, represent those from 𝐴. We calculate the pairwise cosine similarity between clips from 𝐵 and 𝐴. We then introduce similarity threshold 𝜏 = 0.5. Clips in 𝐴 with 𝑆max(𝑎𝑗) below this threshold are considered 𝑆max(𝑎𝑗) = max 1𝑖𝑁𝐵 𝑆(𝑏𝑖, 𝑎𝑗) Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models Figure 5: Overview of our video annotation framework combining bottom-up clip-level and top-down story-level approaches. The diagram illustrates our dual annotation strategy. In the bottom-up approach (left), short video clips are processed by GPT-4o to generate clip-level QA pairs enhanced with time anchors and textural context anchors. In the top-down approach (right), human annotators create story-level segmentations of longer videos, which are then captioned and processed by GPT-4 to generate comprehensive story-level QA pairs. This hierarchical methodology enables both fine-grained temporal understanding and high-level semantic comprehension of video content. most novel relative to 𝐵: 𝐴novel = {𝑎𝑗 𝐴 𝑆max(𝑎𝑗) < 𝜏 } The clips in 𝐴novel and their corresponding original videos are selected to enhance the diversity of our collection. Story-level video data. We construct story-level annotations for long videos using top-down approach. Unlike existing video datasets such as Shot2story Han et al. (2023), which employs shot detection to segment videos and construct storylines across shots, our methodology differs fundamentally. Shot-level segmentation often results in over-segmentation, producing excessively detailed annotations that are suboptimal for constructing coherent story-level text. Instead, we leverage human-annotated chapters as video segments, which provide more semantically meaningful annotations. We incorporate content from ViTT Huang et al. (2020) and Vidchapters Yang et al. (2023) among the selected videos and filter out any videos with fewer than two chapters to ensure they serve as effective story-level sources. Chapter-level dense caption. For video divided into 𝑁 clips, where each clip spans from timestamp 𝑎 to 𝑏, we perform visual captioning for each segment individually. For each segment, frames are sampled at rate of up to 2 frames per second, with maximum of 50 frames. These sampled frames, together with user-provided segment titles, guide GPT-4o OpenAI (2023) in generating detailed visual descriptions focused on the content indicated by the titles. Long-form QA generation. Once visual descriptions for all segments are completed, we compile the captions for the entire video along with their corresponding time intervals and chapter titles. This aggregated information is provided to GPT-4 Achiam et al. (2023), which generates diverse question-answer pairs covering multiple question types. Clip-level video data. Story-level video data typically emphasizes high-level semantic information that unfolds over extended periods. However, for general queries, it is often necessary to focus on localized spatiotemporal details. To address this need, we propose bottom-up, computationally efficient automatic annotation method. This approach enables the generation of short clip annotations and facilitates the conversion of segment-level annotations into video-level ones by incorporating temporal and contextual anchors. Clip-level video QA generation. We generate QA pairs for each short clip in dataset 𝐴 based on various question types. Specifically, we sample frames from each short clip at rate of up to 2 frames per second and input them into GPT-4o.

Experiments 4.1. Comparison with State-of-the-Art VLMs Video benchmarks. As shown in Tab. 2, Eagle2.5-8B demonstrates strong performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks. It achieves 74.8 on MVBench Li et al. (2024), 82.0 on Perception_test Patraucean et al.

Overall, Eagle2.5-8B achieves competitive 75.6 average score, demonstrating its effectiveness as versatile vision-language model that balances performance across various visual understanding tasks. 4.2. Ablation Studies In this section, we conduct experiments on various benchmarks to evaluate our method. We mainly design experiments to study the following questions. Q1: How do video and image data influence each others benchmarks? Tab. 4 studies the impact of long context data on the image benchmark performance. We compare the image benchmark performance without training with long-context data and with training long-context data under different ℒmax. The results show that increasing the long-context data, under our training recipe, does not harm the short-context images and even slightly benefits it. To assess the impact of image data and pre-training on video benchmarks, we conduct comparison using the ℒmax = 32𝐾 model. For each benchmark, we sampled at 2FPS, ensuring maximum of 32 frames. As shown in Tab. 5, extensive image pre-training significantly enhances performance on short video benchmarks like MVBench, as well as on the relatively simple long video benchmark, MLVU. However, for the more challenging and held-out long video benchmark, Video-MME, the improvements are less pronounced. Q2: The effect of information-first sampling on performance? Tab. 6 illustrates the impact of the informationfirst sampling strategy on image and video tasks. Without the Image Area Preservation strategy, high-resolution image benchmarks like InfoVQA and fine-grained video benchmarks such as Perception-test suffer significant performance degradation. The effect on other benchmarks is less pronounced. While the Automatic Degradation 10 Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models Sampling strategy offers convenience for processing various visual inputs, experiments indicate that omitting it poses risk. The vision-context-centric strategy may truncate supervision signals, leading to performance loss. Training & Data recipe MVBench MLVU Video-MME Q3: The impact of different post-training schedules? Tab. 7 illustrates the performance impact of progressive mixed training from 32K to 64K compared to direct 64K mixed training on the video benchmarks. The results demonstrate that progressive training outperforms direct 64K mixed training, possibly due to two reasons: 1) Direct 64K hybrid training disperses samples across the 64K space, diluting the focus on shorter contexts. 2) Some longer samples are challenging to learn without gradual learning process that transitions from easy to difficult. Fig. 6 shows the effect of progressive mixed training on the Video-MME benchmark. It reveals that as progressive training advances, the models capacity to process more frames is gradually enhanced. Table 7: The impact of Eagle-Video-110K dataset and different post-training schedules on the performance of video benchmarks. 32K64K, Open-Data 64K, Open-Data 32K64K, Open-Data + Eagle-Video-110K Val w/o sbutitle 75. 74.0 71.3 73.0 74.5 73.9 68. 67.9 68.1 - Q4: The impact of Eagle-Video-110K data on performance? Finally, we examine the impact of Eagle-Video-110K on the models performance. Tab. 7 indicates that EagleVideo-110K enhances several mainstream long and short video benchmarks. Fig. 6 illustrates the effect of using EagleVideo-110K for training 64K context on Video-MME. Notably, it significantly boosts the models capability to handle numerous frames ( 128 frames) by focusing on the inclusion of long videos that were absent in the Open-Data training set. 5. Conclusion In this work, we introduce Eagle 2.5, family of advanced vision-language models for long-context multimodal understanding. Benefiting from the information-first sampling strategy, the progressive mixed post-training schedule, and the Eagle-Video-110K dataset with dual-level annotations, we boost the long-context understanding capabilitlies significantly, especially on video understanding. Our results show that Eagle 2.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, including both long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding. Notably, Eagle 2.5 is comparable to larger frontier models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on video understanding despite having fewer parameters. With advanced training strategies and diverse data, Eagle 2.5 sets strong foundation for future research, paving the way for efficient and versatile VLMs in complex real-world scenarios.

Framework We integrate and develop multiple technologies to optimize long-context training framework, encompassing GPU memory optimization, distributed context parallelism, and video processing acceleration. GPU Memory Optimization. We integrate Triton-based fused operators replacing PyTorchs MLP, RMSNorm, and RoPE Su et al. (2024) implementations. We employ operators that fuse linear layers with cross-entropy loss to eliminate intermediate logit storage, and utilize CPU-offloading of hidden states to further reduce GPU memory usage. Distributed Context Parallelism. Building on USP Fang and Zhao (2024), we adopt two-layer communication group based on Ulysses and Ring Liu et al. (2023). Rather than using zigzag ring-attention, we implement zigzag Llama3-style Dubey et al. (2024) context parallelism with all-gather KV to reduce communication latency. Video Decoding Acceleration. Training often requires sampling specific sparse video frames, which can cause frame seek latency or memory management issues. We optimize this process through rapid video metadata parsing, improving long video decoding while minimizing memory consumption. Inference Acceleration. We deploy VLLM Kwon et al. (2023) for model serving and evaluation, significantly reducing memory requirements and accelerating inference speed. B.2. Training Settings To maximize resource utilization, we use the model weight from the Stage-1.5 training of Eagle-2 and extend long-context training in stage 2.
