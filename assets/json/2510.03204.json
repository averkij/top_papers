            "content": "Yet, these agents face critical challenge when processing modern websites: observations extracted from web pages are often extremely long. Extracting the accessibility tree (AxTree) is an effective way to reduce by about 10x the web page textual content compared to the Document Object Model (DOM), but it often exceeds tens of thousands of tokens. More importantly, processing such extensive input is computationally expensive, slows down the agent, and introduces security risks such as prompt injection attacks, which are particularly problematic given that only fraction of the web page is typically relevant to accomplishing the task goal. Prior work either rely on training semantic similarity models to select top-relevant DOM chunks [6, 17], or on rough truncation strategies that discard the bottom part of observations to fit context constraints [7]. Yet, both approaches are limited: the former often underperforms in zero-shot settings, and the latter can discard essential contextual information. At the core of these challenges lies the difficulty of retrieving the right information from web-agent observation. Unlike static document retrieval, web navigation tasks involve dynamic, stateful observations that reflect not Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: Overview of FOCUSAGENT pipeline with and without prompt injection attacks. The first stage is for retrieving relevant lines from the observation, including removing prompt injections if present. The second stage uses the pruned observation to predict actions to complete the task goal. just the current page content but also the consequences of previous actions. Standard retrieval approaches based on semantic similarity alone often fall short: they may find chunks relevant to the goal but overlook key elements encoding previous actions consequences and the page state, which are crucial for future action planning. Moreover, prompt injection is major threat to agent safety and security [29, 30]. These systems cannot be deployed in real-world applications unless they are able to show strong immunity to security threats, along with consistent performance under attacks. Existing methods consider building defense layers around agents [5, 3], highlighting utility-security trade-off as the performance degrades in attack-free settings. Our approach seeks to build an inherently safe agent while mitigating this trade-off. To address these challenges, we present FOCUSAGENT, web agent that leverages simple yet effective method to retrieve and format the right subset of information at each step to let web agents plan and act with more focus and reduced prompt injection risk due to threat elimination. Our method leverages smaller LLM to selectively extract observation lines that are most relevant for subsequent navigation decisions. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely on static semantic matching, the retrieval component implicitly accounts for planning context, using task goals and optionally action history to determine what information should be preserved. Figure 1 illustrates FOCUSAGENTs two-stage pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate that FOCUSAGENT effectively minimizes observation size by over 50% on average and often more than 80% while sustaining equivalent performance levels as using the full observation. Furthermore, we found that FOCUSAGENT is capable of removing security threats and maintaining consistent performance on task completion as in an attack-free setup. We list our contributions as follows: We introduce simple yet novel method that reduces the observation size, creating more efficient web agents. We provide extensive experimental validation demonstrating FOCUSAGENTs effectiveness across various web navigation tasks. We show how our method can be leveraged as security feature in web agents, by significantly reducing the attack success and maintaining relevant overall performance. We release open-source implementations1 to facilitate community adoption and further advancement of observation pruning techniques for web agents. 1Agents can be found in AgentLab: https://github.com/ServiceNow/AgentLab"

            "content": "Observation Processing in Web Agents. Building agents capable of understanding and interacting with complex web interfaces requires understanding the observation of the interactive environment [21, 11]. In general, approaches rely on 3 types of observations: (1) AxTrees [32, 7], (2) DOM [20, 11, 6] or (3) screenshots [16, 9, 26], each having their limitations. DOM-based approaches apply retrieval models as in Weblinx [17] or reranking models as in Mind2Web [6] to DOM chunks, enabling agents to process only the most relevant information for task completion while filtering out noisy, irrelevant content that degrades performance. Another approach considered generating cleaner version of the DOM observation with an LLM [31]. But this approach does not scale to real-world DOMs, which are very long, given that the generation is expensive and time-consuming. Other approaches considered converting the DOM into Markdwon [23] or convert tables only from AxTrees [27]. In contrast, AxTree-based methods have traditionally relied less on retrieval since AxTrees are typically more concise and contain fewer technical keywords than DOM representations, allowing them to fit within model context limits [32, 7, 22]. However, as web apps grow more complex and AxTrees expand, context limits and rising processing costs demand smarter filtering. Traditional embeddings struggle with navigation tasks that require understanding interactive elements, planning, and user goals. We address this with an LLM-based retriever that filters observations using planning context and user intent, improving the selection of navigation-relevant elements. Retrieval in Web Agents. Previous work in web agents explored retrieval to augment agents with previous trajectories of successful tasks similar to the current one for In-Context Learning to improve the performance of the agents [31, 25, 1]. There are multiple reasons why providing examples is helpful, either for the planning [12] or for keeping an up-to-date memory [10]. However, our work is interested in retrieval on the observation as processing procedure and not data-augmentation one. Our work aligns closely with previous approaches based on semantic similarity for DOM pruning like the previously mentioned Mind2Web [6] and Weblinx [17]. Agents Safety. The increasing autonomy of web agents has exposed important security vulnerabilities, notably to indirect prompt injection from the operational environment. Researchers have demonstrated various attack vectors designed to steal sensitive user data [15], adversarial pop-ups that exploit vision-language models [29, 3], and complex attacks spanning hybrid web-OS environments [14]. To evaluate these threats, the field has progressed from static, prompt-based benchmarks [2, 19] to more realistic stateful and end-to-end evaluations that assess agents on multi-step tasks in interactive settings [24, 13, 8, 14, 3]. These benchmarks reveal significant security gaps: frontier models exhibit high Attack Success Rates (ASR) [14], simple defenses are often ineffective [29, 3], and even dedicated defense mechanisms can be systematically bypassed by adaptive attacks [28]. While agents sometimes fail to complete the full malicious goal due to capability limitations (\"security by incompetence\" [8]), the high rate of attempted attacks highlights that prevailing defense strategies, which simply halt the task, are insufficient. This motivates our work on retrieval-based observation sanitization to neutralize threats without sacrificing task completion."

            "content": "We present FOCUSAGENT, web agent that leverages an LLM retriever to prune AxTrees and keep only step-wise relevant information for the agent browser interaction. System Architecture. FOCUSAGENT is designed to leverage simple method to retrieve relevant information from observations to provide web agents for effective planning and task completion. Retrieval is applied as pre-processing method to each observation at each step of an episode. Our approach utilizes lightweight LLM as selective filter. We construct prompt containing three key components: (1) the current task goal, (2) the current observation with each line uniquely numbered for identification, (3) optionally the complete interaction history documenting the agents previous actions on the page, and (4) instructions on how the LLM should return line spans. The LLM analyzes this context to identify line ranges that are likely to contribute to future action decisions then selects relevant content. Following the LLMs identification of relevant line ranges, post-processing filters out the irrelevant lines from the observation. Resulting in significantly reduced yet functionally complete representation of the web page state. This streamlined observation is then passed to the 3 Figure 2: Illustration of the operation of FOCUSAGENT retrieval component for the task Upvote the newest post in the deeplearning subreddit at step 2 on WebArena (task ID 407). The retrieval procedure consists of three stages: (1) line numbers are systematically assigned to each element of the AxTree, after which prompt is constructed incorporating the task objective and, where applicable, the interaction history; (2) the LLM generates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) together with the line ranges identified as relevant to task completion; and (3) revised AxTree is produced by removing irrelevant lines and inserting placeholder that specifies the number of lines pruned. agent, allowing it to operate with lighter context while retaining access to all critical information for the step and task completion. Figure 2 provides visual overview of this process. Longer Context Management. The system can easily be extended to handle longer pages that exceed the retrievers LLM context length. The retriever can process multiple prompts sequentially, each containing part of the AxTree to fit in the maximum context length of an LLM. Final answers (line ranges) can be combined to build the final retrieved observation. However, during experimentation, we did not encounter samples where the prompt of the retriever exceeded the maximum token length of the LLMs we used (128k tokens). Retrieval Strategy. FOCUSAGENT employs soft retrieval prompting strategy, which encourages retrieving more information when hesitating rather than restraint. The retriever uses the task goal and the current observation, without the history. Details on the design choices are given in Section 7."

For the evaluations, we use 2 benchmarks of the suite whose main objective is to complete task, given its goal and an accompanying web page, within specified step limit. (1) WorkArena L1 [7], real-world benchmark focused on routine knowledge work tasks. (2) WebArena [32], real-world tasks benchmark consisting of 812 tasks. To facilitate reproducibility while ensuring efficient use of resources, we use the BrowserGym test split [4], which is subset of 381 tasks from WebArena. 4.2 Modeling GenericAgent with Bottom Truncation (GenericAgent-BT). We use GenericAgent [7], an opensource generic agent available on the BrowserGym framework, which applies bottom-truncation for observations when they are too long. This agent has been evaluated on multiple benchmarks and Table 1: Success Rates (SR) and Standard Error (SE) of agents leveraging different retrieval methods on WorkArena L1 using GPT-4.1 as the backbone model for all agents and GPT-4.1-mini for the retriever of FOCUSAGENT.

See the work by (author?) [7] for more details on the truncation algorithm. EmbeddingAgent. We build baseline that leverages embeddings to retrieve relevant chunks. Similar to the Dense Markup Ranker (DMR) method [17], we set the query to the task goal and the history of previous interaction with the task. The chunks are built at each step based on the current observation. We set the chunk size to 200 tokens with an overlap of 10 tokens, we normalize embeddings, and use cosine_similarity as similarity measure. The final observation consists of up to the top-10 retrieved chunks, depending on availability, with maximum size of the AxTree being 2000 tokens or the size of the original AxTree if this one is smaller than 2000 tokens. We use OpenAIs text-embedding-3-small as the text embedding model. More details on the observation and the chunk size selection are given in Appendix E. BM25Agent. We build an agent leveraging BM25 [18], which is keyword-based approach, to retrieve relevant parts of the AxTree according to the query. Similarly to the EmbeddingAgent baseline, we set the query to the task goal and the history of previous actions. At each step, we build corpus for each AxTree by decomposing it into chunks of 200 tokens with an overlap of 10 tokens. Then the corpus (chunks) and the query are tokenized to get the top-10 retrieved chunks that are relevant to the query. See more details on the approach in Appendix E. Agent Design. All agents are designed to operate under standardized evaluation protocol across the 2 selected benchmarks: WorkArena L1 and WebArena. Each agent is allowed maximum of 15 and 30 steps per task on each benchmark, respectively. Each agent is restricted to maximum context length of 40k tokens except for the bottom-truncation agent GenericAgent-4.1 (5k) with 5k tokens. We set the maximum number of tokens to 128k for the retriever. We use GPT-4.1-mini as the retrieval model and vary the agents backbone models by testing with GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-3.7. 4.3 Metrics Success Rate and Standard Error. For each agent and benchmark, we report the Success Rate (SR) with the Standard Error (SE) over the benchmark. We use BrowserGym and Agentlab [4] frameworks to run our experiments as they unify the interface between agents and environments. We run WorkArena L1 on 10 seeds for each task, which results in 330 tasks. For WebArena, we run all tasks with 1 seed, which results in 381 tasks. Observation Pruning Percentage. We quantify the pruning (reduction) in observation size by comparing the retrieved observation (or) to the initial original observation (oi) using the formula: Reduction(oi) = 1 or oi , where oi and or denote the lengths (i.e., token count) of the original and retrieved observations, respectively. 5 Table 2: Success Rates (SR) with Standard Error (SE) and average pruning (Prun.) of the AxTree compared to the original for baseline agent and our approach on WorkArena L1 and WebArena benchmarks, with variant backbone models and GPT-4.1-mini as the retrieval model.

            "content": "In this section, we discuss the key insights from our experimental evaluation of FOCUSAGENT, examining the effectiveness of LLM-based retrieval compared to the embedding-based approach, and the impact of observation pruning on web agent performance. Classic vs LLM Retrieval in Interactive Environments. Table 1 and Figure 3 show that the embedding-based approach is failing on the benchmark compared to LLM-based retrieval (FOCUSAGENT), achieving 40.3% success on WorkArena L1 in contrast to 51.5% respectively. We hypothesize this is due to the embedding retriever being too generalist and used in zero-shot setting. Pruning rates are similar in average for all retrieval agents, except that the performance drop is notable (more than 10 points for both BM25Agent and EmeddingAgent). We hypothesize it is because other chunks in the observation are relevant to the web page understanding for task completion, but are not explicitly mentioned in the task goal embedding, and the BM25 retrievers are trying to match. In sum, these results suggest that while classic retrieval methods (keyword and embedding) can capture text similarity, they lack the contextual reasoning capabilities necessary for step-wise retrieval in interactive tasks that require understanding the state of the environment to complete tasks. Pruning Correlation with Size of the Observation. Regarding the pruning ratios, Figure 4 highlights that higher token rate does not necessarily correlate with higher or lower pruning rate, suggesting that the pruning effectiveness depends more on the content of the observation rather than just the token count. In general, these results emphasize that observation pruning must not only aim to compress but also preserve representational information. The challenge is to remove irrelevant content without producing degenerate or overly abstracted AxTrees that break the models understanding of the state of the page. Further analysis of the pruning can be found in Appendix C. (a) WorkArena L1 (b) WebArena Figure 4: Original vs Pruned tokens of AxTrees for FOCUSAGENT (4.1-mini) with GPT-4.1 as backbone on benchmarks. Both figures show the pruning distribution of step-wise AxTrees."

            "content": "As recently shown, agents are sensitive to prompt-injection attacks [29, 3], i.e. when malicious text is included in the observation but not visible to the user. For instance, previous work showed that adding defense layer, which is an LLM prompted to detect if an attack is happening or not, before calling the agent [3]. When the LLM detected an attack, the workflow stops and the agent is rewarded 0 for not completing the task. The defense layer showed good performance at detecting attacks when present. However, the previous workflow results in very low agent performance, as the tasks are always stopped when an attack is present. Furthermore, due to false positive detections, the performance of the agent is reduced when there is no attack. We are interested in building robust agents that perform as effectively in defending against attacks as they do under normal, attack-free conditions. We hypothesize that retrieval can detect the attack and remove it at the same time so that the agent could complete the initial goal safely. To verify our hypothesis, we use DoomArena [3], framework for testing LLM agents against security threats, it provides multiple types of attacks for Web agents. For instance, banner attacks, where malicious instructions are inserted in an SVG and their alt fields. Popup attacks, where popup shows up containing malicious text that is not visible to the user but is inside the textual representation of the web page (AxTree). Examples of these attacks are given in Appendix G). Additionally, it is possible to evaluate the agent against combinations of both attacks. In this work, we evaluate on the 2 separate types of attacks, and focus on the text-only ones. 6.1 Experiments We design set of experiments using four agents: two base agents (GenericAgent), the regular agent and one with guard layer (GenericAgent + Guard); variant of FocusAgent with an attack warning prompt (DefenseFocusAgent). The Guard layer added to GenericAgent is an LLM-judge based on GPT-4o from DoomArena [3], each time an attack is detected it stops the agent workflow. The attack warning prompt added to DefenseFocusAgent alerts the agent from potential attacks and instructs it to proceed with caution; exact prompts are provided in Appendix G. We report two metrics for evaluation: (1) Attack Success Rate (ASR) which measures the effectiveness of attacks, and (2) Task Success Rate which is the standard success rate for agent tasks we compute for agents. Table 3 presents the results of these experiments conducted on WebArena Reddit (114 tasks). (a) DoomArena attacks (b) Attack SR vs Task SR Figure 5: Attack Success Rate vs. Task Success Rate of agents on WebArena Reddit under no attacks and under banner and popup attacks. The green zone is the ideal zone for agents, attacks have less than 5% chance of succeeding. The red zone is the high risk zone, attacks have at least 50% chance or more to succeed and mislead the agent. 7 Table 3: ASR (lower is better) and TSR (higher is better) of agents on WebArena Reddit using DoomArena framework (114 tasks). We use 2 different models as the backbone model and GPT-4.1-mini for all the retrievers. The SE of these runs varies (SE [1.3, 4.7]). Attack Type Agent GPT-4. Claude-Sonnet-3.7 ASR TSR ASR TSR No Attack Banner Popup GenericAgent GenericAgent + Guard DefenseFocusAgent - - - GenericAgent GenericAgent + Guard DefenseFocusAgent GenericAgent GenericAgent + Guard DefenseFocusAgent 32.4 0 0.9 90.4 0 1.0 51.8 46.5 51. 34.8 0 42.1 0 0 2.0 - - - 10.5 0 2.63 81.6 0 0.9 61.4 55.3 61. 55.2 0 51.8 2.6 0 1.8 6.2 Discussion Mitigating Attack Effectiveness via Retrieval. DefenseFocusAgent is able to retrieve information that is relevant to the task while eliminating the attack. It improves the TSR on banner attacks while maintaining low ASR, especially for GPT-4.1 agent. On popup attacks, the TSR augments slightly with both models, but what is most interesting is the ASR dropping from over 80% to less than 1% for both models. Which highlights the ability of DefenseFocusAgent to eliminate attacks while preserving consistent performance in an attack-free setup with both models. Further analysis showed that for popup attacks, DefenseFocusAgent was able to bypass the attack and remove it from the observation while retrieving important elements for the step. However, the agent ultimately failed on task completion because the popup remained open throughout all steps. Since the defense agent deliberately ignored the popup, it was not part of the observation for the agent. The popup might have been closed, but including the close button in the observation enables the attack, as the button itself contains the injection prompt (see Figure 22). Banner attacks, while less disruptive than popups, still revealed some vulnerabilities. The rare cases where these attacks succeeded occurred when the page was overwhelmed by the injected attack text rather than web page elements. This typically happened when the agent attempted to access URL that returned 404 Not Found error, leaving the page dominated by the attack content (an example of the AxTree is given in Figure 20). similar issue occurred when an image was opened, reducing the page to single element that was saturated by the attack (see example in Figure 21). In general, we can see there is tradeoff between ASR and TSR, higher TSR is coming at an ASR price, which we are trying to reduce but were not able to nullify, there is potential for enhancement and further investigation. Impact of Attacks on Task Success Rate. The attacks seem to be disturbing the agents in the completion of their task, even when the ASR is very low. For instance, DefenseFocusAgent is succeeding at only 2% of the tasks but the popup attack success is very low (1% only). These popup attacks disturb the agent by blocking the actions execution, as they appear on top of the page and dont allow interaction with background elements. They can be avoided by closing the popup, but as mentioned earlier showing the agent the close button would lead to attacking the agent because it contains the injection (see Figure 22 and Figure 23). Future work could explore better ways of solving the problem, for example by cleaning out the injection from the element vessel of the attack before sending it to the agent."

Experiments are run on WorkArena L1 (Wk L1) with 10 seeds for each task of the benchmark (330 tasks) and WebArena Reddit (Wa Reddit) subset (114 tasks), using GPT-4.1 for agents and GPT-4.1-mini as the retriever. 8 Table 4: SR and average pruning of FOCUSAGENT on benchmarks.

(2) Neutral retrieval prompting, in which the LLM is instructed solely to identify and retrieve lines that are relevant. (3) Soft retrieval prompting, in which the LLM is encouraged to retrieve relevant lines, but in cases of uncertainty, to prioritize recall by including potential relevant lines rather than excluding them. Prompts of each strategy are given in Appendix H.1. Furthermore, we explore whether the history of the agents previous actions and thoughts is relevant to the retriever to improve the understanding of the current and future steps. We additionally investigate the impact of the structure and format of the final AxTree fed to the agent affects its performance. We hypothesize the agent cannot be fed set of random chunks, but rather coherent representation that resembles an AxTree. We experiment with three ways of formatting the retrieved AxTree, either by: (1) removing all irrelevant lines from the AxTree, (2) keeping their bid, or (3) keeping their bid and role. For each strategy placeholder is added to mention that information was removed, see examples in Appendix H.2. We now present the results of these ablations and discuss the implications of each design choice. Soft Retrieval Prompting is Best. Table 4a shows that different prompting strategies result in varying pruning scores, which in turn correlate with the agents task performance. While WorkArena results seem to be consistent despite the prompting strategy, WebArena is impacted. Aggressive prompting, while leading to more pruning, hurts the performance of the agent. Neutral pruning while yields to good performance on WorkArena L1, collapses on WebArena. In sum, these results emphasize the need of expliciting how to handle uncertainty for this retrieval task with LLMs. Streamlining the Retriever by Dropping History. The retriever needs to situate the agents current step in the context of the trajectory to complete the task goal. It is intuitive that the history of previous actions and thoughts would help the retriever. However, Table 4a suggests that the performance of the retriever is better without the history, as the model is able to understand the advancement in the task completion based on the current AxTree only. Our hypothesis is that the history, especially CoT of the agent generated by GPT-4.1, are disturbing the understanding of GPT-4.1-mini for the retrieval. AxTree Structure and Pruning-Performance Trade-off. Table 4b shows that removing irrelevant lines achieves the highest pruning and token savings. Nevertheless, the highest performance is attributed to keeping the bid and role of irrelevant lines. Selecting this formatting would not have resulted in cost efficiency (20% of pruning is the minimum to start saving), as the retriever processes the full tokens of the AxTree in addition to the agent-restricted tree processing. The maximum pruning of AxTrees is of 56% and 64% when keeping the bid and adding the role, respectively, because of the additional text regarding the irrelevant bids, while the maximum when completely removing irrelevant lines is around 99%. An example of this pruning is given in Figure 30."

First, the overall performance depends heavily on prompt engineering and is subject to changes in how large language models evolve over time. Second, although the retriever successfully removes attacks from the attack tree, it does not ensure the generation of fully clean web page without residual malicious content. Finally, although the system supports contexts longer than 128k tokens, it remains untested on this setup as we did not encounter it in the experimental benchmarks."

Note that all baselines and agents use an augmented version fo the AxTree using BrowserGym utils. The augmented features are set with the observation flags of GenericAgent and given in Figure 16. The performance of agents using embedding and keyword retrieval is highly dependent on fixed number of chunks and their individual size that are allowed in the observation. In contrast, the LLM retriever is dynamic, which allows it to choose different observation sizes according to the query and step. For the baselines of this paper, we experimented with different chunk sizes [50, 100, 200, 500] given retrieval of top-10 chunks impacts the performance and pruning size. Each leads to an observation with maximum lengths of 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 tokens, or the size of the original AxTree if smaller than these values. We found 200 tokens per chunk was the best tared-off between performance and pruning."

This pricing is meant to changes as these models get deprecated and are replaced with new ones. Equation 1 is applicable to any pair of model pricing in time. Let πθL denote the agents policy with parameters θL and πθS denote the retrieval policy with parameters θS, where θS θL. For observation processing, we define oi as the original observation and or as the reduced observation, with or α oi where α (0, 1] represents the pruning ratio.

This is the starting point to access the hardware store. Additionally, the shopping cart section (lines 225-239) is relevant because after selecting the item, we will need to add it to the cart and possibly verify the quantity. Other categories like \"Services\", \"Office\", \"Peripherals\", \"Software\", \"Desktops\", and \"Mobiles\" are not relevant for ordering an Apple Watch, so they can be excluded. The search box (lines 51-54) might be useful if we want to search for \"Apple Watch\" directly, but since the goal is to go to the hardware store first, the direct link to \"Hardware\" is more relevant. Therefore, the relevant lines are those that include the \"Hardware\" link and description (lines 148-164) and the shopping cart area (lines 225-239) to facilitate ordering. Also, the main content area (lines 38-40) and the root web area (line 1) provide context and should be included to understand the page structure.
