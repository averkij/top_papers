            "title": "1 INTRODUCTION\nGraphic design is a professional field that uses creative visual com-\nmunication to deliver targeted messages. It combines text and im-\nages in forms such as posters, social media graphics, and business\ncards, playing a key role in both marketing and daily life. The disci-\npline demands a high level of expertise, creativity, and innovation,\nwith designers investing significant time to master complex tools\nand techniques. Creating antithetical graphic compositions is es-\npecially time-consuming and requires considerable skill and effort.\nFor beginners, this process is even more challenging.",
            "content": "Recently, there has been significant paradigm shift as Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into various stages of the design process, including layout generation [Tabata et al. 2019; Yamaguchi 2021], hierarchical layout generation [Cheng et al. 2025], logo creation [Wang et al. 2022], artistic text generation [Gao et al. 2019], and color harmony [Cohen-Or et al. 2006] Some recent methods [Inoue et al. 2024; Jia et al. 2023] can even generate complete graphic compositions based on user language instructions. However, these approaches still face limitations, such as difficulty incorporating user-provided assets and lacking sufficient aesthetic appeal. Commercial platformsCanva Magic Design1, Adobe Express2, and Microsoft Designer3offer strong usability by pairing vast template libraries with intelligent search and auto-copywriting. Building and licensing such libraries, however, is impractical for most individuals and small organizations. high-quality AI-generated graphic composition should satisfy four core criteria: Text accuracy: Posters rely on text to convey information, so accurate spelling and proper typography are crucial. asset fidelity: User-provided assetssuch as product images, personal photos, or brand logosmust be correctly placed and preserved in the final design. Editability: Users may wish to modify the generated text or replace certain assets, so the composition should be easily editable. Aesthetic appeal: Beyond functionality, the overall design should be visually pleasing. Currently, no AI system fully achieves all these requirements. However, reaching this level would greatly enhance design efficiency and promote the democratization of graphic design. To close this gap, we have developed an open-source, multi-layer, editable graphic design generation system, CreatiPoster, which not only meets the above requirements but also offers interactive flexibility and high expansiveness. As shown in Figure 2, CreatiPoster couples protocol model with background model: the protocol modela large multimodal network [Cheng et al. 2025]turns user instructions and optional assets into JSON protocol that lists every layer (text or asset) with its z-order, position, font, size, and content, and also emits concise prompt describing the desired backdrop; this JSON can be rendered immediately with engines such as Skia4, yielding fully editable foreground layers as illustrated in Figure 4; the background model then uses the rendered foreground and the prompt to synthesize matching background, after which foreground and background are composited into complete, multilayer graphic whose elements remain disentangled for later editing; evaluated on new benchmark with automated metrics, CreatiPoster outperforms existing open-source and commercial systems, and we further release 100,000 copyright-free, multi-layer samples to catalyze research in AI-driven graphic design. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: We propose CreatiPoster, open system that produces visually compelling, multi-layer graphic compositions while preserving full editability of text and assets. CreatiPoster accommodates diverse user instructions, including prompt-only, asset-only, mixed input, as well as explicit specification of text/asset layout or attributes. Our method demonstrates high extensibility, supporting wide range of interesting applications canvas operation, text overlay, responsive resizing, multilingual generation, and animated poster. 1https://www.canva.com/magic-design/ 2https://www.adobe.com/express/ 3https://designer.microsoft.com/ 4https://skia.org/ CreatiPoster: Towards Editable and Controllable Multi-Layer Graphic Design Generation Under review, Homepage, https://github.com/graphic-design-ai/creatiposter Figure 2: Overview of the CreatiPoster pipeline. User inputs are processed by the protocol model to generate editable design layers, while the background model creates matching background. The final graphic composition combines both outputs. We release copyright-free training dataset and comprehensive benchmark to the community, aiming to advance research in multi-layer graphic design generation."

            "content": "systems relied on aesthetic rules [Bauerly and Liu 2006; Yang et al. 2016] or restricts [Hurst et al. 2009; Jahanian et al. 2013], later works also addressing subproblems like layout [Chai et al. 2023; Cheng et al. 2025; Inoue et al. 2023; Jiang et al. 2023; Li et al. 2019; Yu et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2023a] and color [Cohen-Or et al. 2006; Tokumaru et al. 2002; You et al. 2019] to improve automation in design. Recent methods have mainly sought to simplify the modeling of graphic design problems, often achieving more unified and complete system at the cost of either editability or support for userdefined assets. For example, some layout-based approaches [Horita et al. 2024; Hsu et al. 2023; Li et al. 2023c; Seol et al. 2024; Zhou et al. 2022] only support designs where the main image fills the entire canvas, while certain multi-stage generation methods abstract and simplify layersmethods [Chen et al. 2025; Inoue et al. 2024; Jia et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2025] sacrifice support for user assets, and ART [Pu et al. 2025] compromises on text editability. Our approach also simplifies the modeling of graphic design, but crucially, it preserves both support for user-defined assets and text editability. This makes our system more versatile and general-purpose solution for automated graphic design."

The background model takes as in-\nput the RGBA foreground image output by the protocol model and\na caption describing the background, then generates a matching\nbackground that harmonizes with the foreground. To process the\nRGBA foreground, we first convert it into an RGB image with a\ngray background, which is then encoded using the native varia-\ntional autoencoder (VAE). For the background prompt, we employ\nthe corresponding text encoder to generate background prompt\nembeddings. After encoding the background prompt, noise image,\nand foreground image condition into tokens, denoted as ℎ𝑏 , ℎ𝑧,\nand ℎ𝑓 respectively, we concatenate these tokens along the token\ndimension and feed the resulting token sequence into a stack of\nMM-DiT blocks. Each block comprises linear projection layers (for\nQ, K, V), multimodal attention (MM-Attention), and feed-forward\nnetworks (FFN). For each type of token, a linear projection is applied\nto map them into the corresponding query, key, and value spaces:\n𝑄∗, 𝐾 ∗, 𝑉 ∗ = Linear(ℎ∗), where the symbol ∗ represents different\nmodalities (background prompt, noisy image, or foreground con-\ndition).

From Table 2 and Table 3 CreatiPoster-S or CreatiPoster-F get first or near-first score in almost all evaluation dimensions, which proves the leadership of our method. Layout. Based on both the table scores and humans overall rating, CreatiPoster demonstrates satisfactory performance in certain straightforward graphic design scenarios. However, it is important to note that all evaluated methods still achieve relatively low scores in the layout dimension, with none surpassing score of 3. Among the methods, CreatiPoster-S achieves the highest score, closely followed by Canva (2.85). These results highlight persistent challenge for current automated design tools: they struggle to produce layouts that are truly design-oriented and comparable to those created by human experts. This is especially evident in complex scenarios where graphics and text are intricately interwoven and must interact seamlessly. The limitations suggest that further advancements are needed for AI-driven tools to reach human-level proficiency in layout design. Color. Across all evaluated methods, the color dimension consistently achieved relatively high scores, reflecting the strengths of the underlying generative models in handling color. Notably, GPT exhibited clear preference for the color schemes produced by OpenCOLE [Inoue et al. 2024] and CreatiPoster-S, underscoring the exceptional ability of these models to generate visually harmonious and appealing color palettes. These results indicate that OpenCOLE and method-S are particularly adept at color selection, which plays crucial role in enhancing the overall aesthetic quality of the posters. CreatiPoster: Towards Editable and Controllable Multi-Layer Graphic Design Generation Under review, Homepage, https://github.com/graphic-design-ai/creatiposter Graphic Style. In evaluating graphic style, particular emphasis is placed on the overall stylistic coherence of the poster, including the harmonious integration of text and images. Leveraging the combined strengths of LMMs and generative modeling techniques, CreatiPoster excels in this dimension, achieving the highest overall score. This synergy enables CreatiPoster to produce posters that are not only visually appealing but also exhibit strong sense of unity and coordination between graphic elements and textual content, resulting in more polished and professional appearance. Compliance. In terms of compliance, CreatiPoster-S/F stand out as the leading methods, consistently responding well to user prompts in both scenarios with and without asset inputs. Their superior performance is evident in their ability to accurately interpret and fulfill user requirements, regardless of the presence or resolution of input assets. This robust handling of diverse input conditions underscores the effectiveness of CreatiPoster-S/F in adhering to user instructions and generating outputs that closely match the intended design specifications. Human Evaluate. Human evaluators generally concurred that our approach achieved higher scores across the assessed criteria. During the evaluation process, however, they also observed notable pattern in the outputs (which is generated by Canva Magic Design and Microsoft Designer). Specifically, these methods may rely on set of generic poster templates as their guarantee mechanism, simply replacing the text and the provided assets for each new case. As result, the posters produced by Canva Magic Design and Microsoft Designer often appeared repetitive and lacked diversity in their overall design. This reliance on template-based generation limited the visual variety and creativity of the outputs, making them less distinctive compared to those generated by our approach, which demonstrated greater originality and adaptability to different prompts and assets. Failure Cases. Although CreatiPoster delivers strong overall results, as shown in Figure 7, we still observe two recurring failure modes: 1) small icons often appear distorted, and 2) text and asset layers sometimes drift out of alignment. Icon distortion stems from the inability of current generators to retain fine detail and crisp edges at tiny scalesespecially when an icons structure is intricate or rendered in low-resolution region of complex layout. Misalignment, on the other hand, reflects limits in the protocol models spatial reasoning: it can mis-estimate coordinates or ignore overlap and padding between layers. Users can fix these issues manually, but that adds extra work. Eliminating icon distortion will require higher-fidelity generatorse.g., native 4K diffusion modelswhile mitigating misalignment calls for better layout modeling and fontaware reasoning in large multimodal models, both of which remain open research challenges. Figure 5: Comparison with methods in only text prompt input, including open-source approaches (OpenCOLE [Inoue et al. 2024] and closed-source commercial systems (Microsoft Designer, Canva Magic Design). Except for CreatiPoster, other methods can only output few fixed sizes.

Figure 7: The main failure cases of CreatiPoster are due to distortion when generating small icons and occasional misalignment between text and assets."

This is particularly useful for tasks such as adding titles to product images for e-commerce or overlaying text on photos for social media. Poster Re-Layout.

This workflow is ideal for producing multiple video covers or posters tailored to various platforms. Canvas Mode. The protocol model can accept fixed protocol fields, allowing for advanced canvas operations. For example, users can lock certain elements and only update new ones, or engage in multi-round editing. In this paper, we demonstrate scenarios where element positions are specified. The closed-source commercial system of the famous design platform Recraft 7 has similar canvas operation capabilities, but its generated posters are single-layer and not editable. As shown in the Figure 10, its IP retention ability and text accuracy are weaker than CreatiPoster. Multilingual Generation. Since our protocol model was pretrained and trained on multilingual dialogue data, although it was not trained on multilingual protocol data, it demonstrates generalization to other languages. As shown in Figure 11, we present examples in Japanese, French, and Arabic. Animated Poster. Because CreatiPoster outputs layered results, Text-to-Video models [Sand-AI 2025] can animate the background layer, which can then be merged with the protocol layers. This approach maintains text accuracy and editability while enabling dynamic, visually engaging posters. Examples are shown in Figure 12; more can be found in the demo video."

CreatiPoster: Towards Editable and Controllable Multi-Layer Graphic Design Generation Under review, Homepage, https://github.com/graphic-design-ai/creatiposter Figure 8: Graphic compositions created by overlaying text onto user-uploaded assets, which serve as the background layer (BG-Layer). The Protocol Model generates the necessary text layers based on the provided information, and the final result is produced using rendering engine. In this mode, the background model is not required. Figure 9: Given an original graphic design, CreatiPoster generates alternative layouts of various sizes while preserving content and style. By reusing rendered layers and predicting new foreground and background elements, the approach enables efficient adaptation of designs for different platforms. Figure 10: Graphic compositions are generated in canvas mode, allowing users to freely position text and elements and specify their attributes. The system then refines the design for improved aesthetics based on prompts. We compare our approach with Recraft, which generates single-layer posters from canvas images. In contrast to Recraft, our protocol-based method preserves text accuracy and material identity, whereas Recrafts results often show text errors and loss of material fidelity.

Although the training data includes only Simplified Chinese and English graphic compositions, pre-training and multilingual fine-tuning enable the protocol model to generalize to other languages. Figure 12: Extend graphic compositions generated by CreatiPoster to animated posters. The videos are generated according to background layers using image-to-video model.
