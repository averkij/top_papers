            "content": "The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) (et al. 2024; Zhao et al. 2023; Minaee et al. 2024; Chang et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2024) is driving the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, enabling them to operate diverse digital platforms such as computers, web browsers, and smartphones (Liu et al. 2025b; Tang et al. 2025; Liu et al. 2025a). Early research on mobile agents primarily focused on replicating human-like flexibility through GUIonly interaction (Lee et al. 2025; Gou et al. 2024; Cheng et al. 2024; You et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024; Lu et al. 2025). This approach grants agents the generality to operate on any application, but it often overlooks the significant efficiency advantages offered by more direct methods. *These authors contributed equally. Project Lead. Corresponding authors. Figure 1: Workflow of GUI Only vs. GUI-Shortcut Hybrid Agent. Shortcuts improve agent execution efficiency by bypassing GUI operations. As GUI agents are increasingly applied to complex tasks, enhancing their efficiency has become central research focus. In this context, hybrid paradigms have emerged as promising solution, demonstrating effectiveness across wide range of platforms (Wang et al. 2025b; Zheng et al. 2025; Zhang et al. 2025a,b; Jiang et al. 2025; Lee et al. 2023). This approach combines the speed and reliability of shortcuts such as Application Programming Interface (API) calls, deep links, and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) scripts (Bridle and McCreath 2006; Guerreiro, Gamboa, and Jorge 2008; Kennedy and Everett 2011; Tripathi 2018; Ling, Gao, and Wang 2020; Agostinelli et al. 2022), with the flexibility of GUI operations. As Fig. 1 illustrates, hybrid agent can bypass tedious, multi-step GUI operations by invoking single, efficient shortcut, drastically reducing operational complexity and time. However, despite these advancements, framework for systematically evaluating and benchmarking hybrid agents is still lacking (Le et al. 2020; Roffarello, Purohit, and Purohit 2024; Zhang et al. 2025a,b). This gap leaves the full potential of GUI-Shortcut agents far from being thoroughly explored and assessed. While this is general challenge, the mobile domain represents critical and demanding environment for progress. Therefore, we present MAS-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate GUI-shortcut hybrid mobile agents. The tasks within MAS-Bench are solvable entirely through GUI interactions, but integrating shortcuts can improve efficiency. MAS-Bench evaluates agents ability to make optimal decisions between different operational modes to enhance performance. Our experiments on MAS-Bench show that hybrid agents achieve up to 64.1% success rate, significant improvement over the 44.6% achieved by their GUI-only counterparts, and execute tasks with over 40% greater efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce novel framework to evaluate agents capacity to generate new shortcuts from interaction. This framework integrates agent-generated shortcuts into standard baseline agent and measures subsequent task performance. Our findings reveal performance gap: while our predefined shortcuts prove highly reliable (100% success rate), agent-generated shortcuts lag in robustness and efficiency. Dynamic shortcuts demonstrate significant potential. Despite their task completion rate of 38% (baseline 43%), they offer the highest efficiency, highlighting them as promising direction for future research into robust shortcut generation. Our contributions are threefold: We introduce MAS-Bench, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating GUI-shortcut hybrid mobile agents. It comprises 139 complex tasks spanning 11 realworld applications, supported by knowledge base of 88 predefined shortcuts and 7 distinct evaluation metrics. We establish baselines with several agents on MASBench, demonstrating that those leveraging GUI-shortcut hybrid operations achieve significantly higher success rates and efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. We propose the first framework to evaluate an agents ability to generate shortcuts from interaction. Our experiments reveal substantial gap between agent-generated shortcuts and predefined ones in efficiency and robustness, highlighting key area for future research."

Zhang et al. (Zhang et al. 2025a) provide detailed analysis of API and GUI agents; the former gain attention for their stability and programming integration capabilities, while the latter possesses strong adaptability. These considerations regarding the efficiency and robustness of GUI agents lead to an exploration of how to combine LLM with efficient shortcut methods, thereby promoting the rise of research in GUI-Shortcut agents. GUI-Shortcut Hybrid Operations. Researchers explore GUI-Shortcut methods to enhance agent capabilities and address the persistent challenges in task completion rate, costs, and operational efficiency for LLM-based GUI agents. For instance, UFO2 (Zhang et al. 2025b), desktop AgentOS, demonstrates robust task execution through its multi-agent architecture and unified GUI-API action layer that deeply integrates with operating system and application features. Inspired by such work, AppAgentX (Jiang et al. 2025) improves efficiency by evolving high-level actions into shortcuts based on task execution history. MobileAgent-E (Wang et al. 2025a) uses its self-evolving module, learns and stores general-purpose Tips and reusable Shortcuts from past experiences to continuously improve performance and efficiency. While these efforts focused on the mobile domain are promising, they also highlight the urgent need for systematic method to evaluate the effectiveness of these emerging hybrid operations on mobile devices. Mobile GUI Agent Benchmark. As agents evolve from GUI-based interaction to hybrid GUI-Shortcut operations, they place new demands on benchmarking. Among existing benchmarks, MobileAgentBench (Wang et al. 2024c) focuses on the foundational GUI navigation and task completion capabilities of LLM-powered mobile agents. MobileEval-E (Wang et al. 2025a) includes complex, real-world mobile tasks that require long-horizon, cross-app interactions. While these benchmarks advance research in various dimensions, there remains need for benchmark that can comprehensively evaluate the ability of agents to intelligently discover, decide upon, and execute diverse shortcuts within GUI interactions and also measure the overall task effectiveness of this GUI-Shortcut hybrid operation (Zhang et al. 2025b)."

            "content": "GUI Action. GUI actions simulate direct human interaction with an applications interface. This action space consists of basic operations such as click, swipe, and type, enabling the agent to navigate and interact with UI elements. Detailed definitions for each action are provided in Appendix A.2. GUI actions are essential for dynamic scenarios with unavailable predefined shortcuts. Shortcut Action. Shortcut actions can trigger specific functions or navigate to designated pages, bypassing multistep GUI actions. In MAS-Bench, shortcuts are categorized into two types: Predefined shortcuts and Agent-generated shortcuts. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the predefined shortcuts in MASBench primarily consist of APIs, deep-links, and RPA scripts. API: Direct programmatic control that executes specific functions by calling an applications internal services without UI interaction. This method can alter application state or retrieve data directly, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Deep Link: specialized URI that targets specific page or function within an application. As shown in Fig. 2(b), this enables direct navigation, bypassing multi-step GUI actions. RPA Script: An Automation script designed to handle specific, highly repetitive subtask. Unlike single action, an RPA script encapsulates complex workflow of GUI actions, API calls, or deep-links, consolidating multistep process into single, efficient shortcut action, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The agent-generated shortcuts are created dynamically by the agent itself. They are typically formed by identifying and abstracting repetitive subtasks from the agents execution history into new, executable routines. This capability allows the agent to learn from experience and progressively optimize its performance by creating customized shortcuts. Preprint under review Figure 2: Functional Comparison of APIs, Deep-Links, and RPA Scripts. The figure uses the Amazon app as an example: (a) the open cart() API call directly opens the shopping cart; (b) the search product() deep-link directly performs product search; and (c) an RPA script combines APIs, deep links, and GUI operations to automate complete workflow."

            "content": "Predefined Shortcuts Knowledge Base. To validate the feasibility of hybrid GUI-shortcut operations on mobile devices, we construct predefined knowledge base of commonly used mobile shortcuts. Based on 11 popular apps, it includes 11 APIs, 70 Deep Links, and 7 custom RPA scripts, for total of 88 predefined shortcuts. The knowledge base provides agents with rich, queryable resource to select appropriate actions based on task instructions. To ensure real-world relevance, APIs were sourced from official documentation and static analysis of application packages. At the same time, Deep Links were identified by analyzing each applications declared URI schemes and entry points. The custom RPA scripts were designed to encapsulate common, high-repetition sub-tasks, testing an agents ability to leverage complex, pre-built automation routines. More details on the collection and design methodology are available in the Appendix A.3. Agent-Generated Shortcuts. Besides predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench supports evaluating agent-generated shortcuts to test an agents learning and abstraction capabilities. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of MASBench in evaluating agents capabilities of generating shortcuts, we have incorporated several contrasting shortcut generation methods for evaluation. We include Macro-level action trajectory replay (abbreviated as action replay) shortcuts that record and replay entire task or sub-task execution trajectories. We also incorporate dynamic shortcuts that require the agent to perform real-time grounding based on execution shortcuts for these recurrent operations. This design aims to test whether an agent, after completing sub-task via GUI operations for the first time, can identify the repetitive pattern and then autonomously generate an efficient shortcut for subsequent use."

However, systematic framework to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of these generation methods is currently lacking. Therefore, MAS-Bench encourages and evaluates the agents ability to generate new shortcuts autonomously. As shown in Fig. 3, we design the following evaluation method. First, self-generation shortcut agent explores the MASBench environment and creates its shortcut knowledge base. To ensure fairness and eliminate interference from the intrinsic abilities of the agent under test, we use unified baseline GUI agent as the evaluated agent and import these shortcut knowledge bases into the baseline agent for task execution.

They are designed by considering user needs from daily life, such as searching for products in shopping app or navigating to location. The tasks typically involve multiple steps and sub-goals, and usable shortcuts exist within our established knowledge base for each task. However, our shortcut knowledge base for these complex tasks is intentionally incomplete. It offers only basic shortcuts, which are insufficient to complete an entire task independently. This design compels agents to synthesize solutions by combining shortcut invocations with multi-step GUI operations, thus providing more realistic test of their planning and reasoning abilities. To test the agents learning and generation capabilities, we introduce scenarios with repetitive sub-tasks. In these scenarios, the knowledge base intentionally lacks predefined Preprint under review Figure 4: The pipeline of MAS-Bench.

Mean Execution Time (MET): The average time an agent takes to complete task. Cost and Resource Utilization. Cost metrics evaluate the computational resources and overhead an agent consumes to complete task. high-performing agent should minimize the overall cost by intelligently utilizing or autonomously generating shortcuts. We use the following metrics to evaluate the cost of an agent: Mean kTokens Cost (MToC): The average number of kTokens the LLM consumes during the task execution. Mean Shortcut Call Count (MSC): The average number of shortcuts the agent calls during the task execution. Shortcut Success Rate (SSR): The ratio of successfully executed shortcut calls to the total number of shortcut calls made by the agent. GUI to Shortcut Action Ratio (GSAR): This metric reflects an agents operational strategy preference by calculating the ratio of GUI to shortcut operations. high ratio, when combined with low token consumption and short execution time, provides strong evidence that the agent utilizes shortcuts both efficiently and intelligently.

MASBench provides fair, reproducible, and in-depth assessment of mobile agents comprehensive capabilities in complex GUI-Shortcut tasks through these multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. It specializes in agents potential for dynamic adaptation and innovative shortcut generation.

            "content": "Finding 1: Integrating predefined shortcut knowledge base significantly enhances agent performance, thereby validating the effectiveness of the hybrid GUI-shortcut operation. Experiments demonstrate that using just the predefined knowledge base of 88 shortcuts can significantly improve an agents task success rate and efficiency. For single-app tasks, compared to the baseline T3A, MAS-T3A improves the success rate (SR) from 51.1% to 57.6% and reduces the token cost from 346.382k to 291.391k. For agents that may terminate prematurely on long-horizon tasks due to errors, such as MobileAgent-E in the Table 2, the Mean Preprint under review Figure 5: Performance comparison of MAS-MobileAgent with and without shortcuts. The base models are Gemini2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.0-Flash. Data points show the relationship between SR and MET for single-app and crossapp tasks, with circle size representing mean cost. Results demonstrate that shortcuts benefit both models, with more significant improvements for the weaker Gemini-2.0-Flash. Step Ratio on Successful tasks (MSRS) provides more accurate assessment of the efficiency gains from shortcuts. MAS-MobileAgent achieves an MSRS of 0.613 on singleapp tasks, which is significantly lower than the baseline versions 1.058, indicating that its execution path is closer to the optimal solution. The SR and MS results for Different-level Tasks can be found in the Appendix B.2. Finding 2: The effectiveness of predefined shortcuts is framework-agnostic and can benefit agents with different input modalities. Experiments show that MAS-T3A and MAS-MobileAgent benefit from predefined shortcuts, regardless of whether they are based on UI Tree or screenshots. The reason lies in that the use of API, Deeplink, and RPA scripts is independent of the agents perception modality. These scripts directly send commands to the operating system or application, bypassing the need for the agent to parse the UI layout in real-time. Finding 3: The performance gain of shortcuts is more significant when the base model is weak. For less capable models like Gemini-2.0-Flash, which often struggle with complex GUI navigation, shortcuts provide crucial way to bypass failure-prone steps. This directly translates into substantial increase in task success. For instance, on CROSS-app tasks, augmenting the Gemini-2.0-Flash agent with shortcuts boosts its success rate from 0% to 23.4% (see the Appendix B.3 for detailed experimental results). Shortcuts mainly contribute to efficiency improvements for strong models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). As shown in Fig. 5, the performance gain of using shortcuts is significantly greater for Gemini-2.0-Flash than for Gemini-2.5-Pro."

In our experiments, Predefined shortcuts achieve the best performance, improving the success rate (SR) by 9% over the baseline while maintaining perfect shortcut success rate (SSR) of 100%. Notably, agents using Predefined shortcuts reduce average execution steps by 25% and decrease total execution time by approximately 16%. Despite having the second-highest shortcut call count per task (1.45), Predefined shortcuts maintain excellent robustness, executing successfully across diverse task configurations. The increased success rate and reduced execution time validate that welldesigned shortcuts will enhance GUI task efficiency. In contrast, Replay-Task shortcuts exhibit poor robustness with only 10% success rate, indicating high susceptibility to environmental variations. This fragility negatively impacts both task completion rates and execution efficiency, underscoring that while effective shortcuts boost GUI performance, poorly designed ones are counterproductive. Our findings reveal substantial room for improvement in model-generated shortcuts. Among all variants, only Predefined and MobileAgent-E shortcuts improve model accuracy, with only Predefined shortcuts simultaneously enhancing both execution speed and success rate.

Furthermore, MAS-Bench provides framework to access the quality and validity of shortcuts that are autonomously generated by the agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the GUI-shortcut hybrid operational approach enhances both the success rate and efficiency of task execution. Moreover, we also validate that our benchmark effectively measures the quality and robustness of the agent-generated shortcuts. Limitations and Future Work. Despite our efforts to provide comprehensive evaluation, the range of comparative baselines remains limited due to the currently underexplored research in Mobile GUI-shortcut hybrid Agents. Therefore, we hope to pay more attention to the efficiency of mobile GUI agents in the future, promoting research into GUI-shortcut Hybrid Mobile Agents."

            "content": "Details of Predefined Shortcuts. Our shortcut knowledge base was created to provide agents with an authentic yet challenging environment. We collect and design shortcuts for 11 selected applications, ensuring their relevance to realworld usage patterns. APIs Collection: The API shortcuts in our knowledge base are application-specific internal APIs. We identify these APIs through official Android documentation. We employ static analysis of the application packages for internal APIs that lack public documentation to identify key functional endpoints. Deep-Links Collection: We collect deep-links by analyzing each applications AndroidManifest.xml file. This file typically declares the URL schemes and paths the application can handle, providing direct mappings to specific pages or functions. RPAs Script Design: RPA scripts are designed for common, highly repetitive sub-tasks (e.g., adding an item with specific options to shopping cart). These scripts can be executed as single action, serving as high-level shortcut. This design enables us to test an agents ability to utilize complex, pre-built automation routines. Preprint under review Details of Agent-Generated Shortcuts. We incorporate several methods to create agent-generated shortcuts. The primary purpose for including this variety of shortcut types is to validate the effectiveness of the MAS-Bench framework itself in evaluating an agents shortcut generation capabilities. By creating test cases with diverse characteristics, we can verify our benchmarks ability to assess different shortcut generation strategies. Macro-level action trajectory replay (action replay) Shortcuts: This category of shortcuts is constructed by recording and replaying an agents historical action trajectories. They execute fixed sequence of low-level actions, such as clicks and swipes at specific coordinates, to automate previously completed workflow. This method is implemented at two distinct granularities: Task-Level Replay: Captures and replays the entire action sequence of full task, from start to finish. This results in single, high-level macro that is highly specific to one complete workflow. Subtask-Level Replay: Identifies and abstracts recurrent, multi-step operations within larger task. This approach generates shorter, more modular shortcuts that automate common sub-workflows. Dynamic Shortcuts: Unlike static macro-replays, these shortcuts are adaptive and robust to UI changes. Instead of replaying hardcoded coordinates, they utilize real-time grounding to semantically identify and interact with target UI elements based on the current screen context. This allows them to function correctly even if the position or layout of UI elements changes. Ultimately, this diverse suite of shortcut types validates that MAS-Bench provides comprehensive framework for evaluating agents shortcut generation capabilities. A.4 Details of Tasks in MAS-Bench We have developed specialized benchmark suite to validate the feasibility of GUI-shortcut hybrid actions for mobile agents and establish framework for the comprehensive evaluation of an agents ability to utilize and generate shortcuts. This suite comprises 139 complex tasks strategically designed across 11 popular real-world applications. The tasks are categorized into 92 single-app tasks and 47 cross-app workflows, with their difficulty distribution illustrated in Table 6. We have also curated corresponding knowledge base of predefined shortcuts to support these tasks. Table 9 presents breakdown of the selected applications and the number of single-app tasks and shortcuts associated with each. Details of Predefined Shortcut Evaluation B.1 Details of MAS-MobileAgent and MAS-T3A Compared to MobileAgentV2, MAS-MobileAgent acquires the standard screenshot and UI elements and retrieves relevant and potentially applicable shortcuts from the shortcut knowledge base, based on the current task goal and interface context.

MAS-T3A operates on similar principle, but its core distinction lies in its input modality: it relies on the structured UI tree, whereas MAS-MobileAgent processes visual screenshots. By evaluating both agents, we aim to demonstrate that the effectiveness of predefined shortcuts is framework-agnostic and can benefit agents with fundamentally different perceptual modalities. B.2 Success Rate on Different-Level Tasks As shown in Table 7, an analysis of metrics such as MSRS reveals that the GUI-shortcut hybrid agent, by utilizing the predefined shortcuts knowledge base, demonstrates improvements in both success rate and efficiency across tasks of varying difficulty levels when compared to the GUI-only agent."

This subset comprises total of 69 tasks, including 46 single-app and 23 cross-app tasks. Bad Case Analysis We further analyze the performance of the GUI-shortcut hybrid agent on failed tasks, with particular focus on cases where the GUI-only agent succeeds, but the GUI-shortcut hybrid agent fails. Our analysis of these failure cases reveals three primary Selection and Planning Errors. This category of error pertains to flaws in the agents task comprehension and strategic planning. These errors typically occur when the agent fails to accurately map the natural language instruction to the correct shortcut, resulting in the invocation of an irrelevant shortcut that leads to task failure. For instance, in an experiment with MAS-MobileAgent using Gemini-2.0-Flash (Fig. 7(a)), the agent was given the instruction: Navigate to the Attractions section. Search for attractions near Berlin for the 6th of next month. After launching the application, the agent made planning error by incorrectly invoking the search hotel() shortcut, which was irrelevant to the Attractions goal, thus causing the task to fail. Behavioral and Adaptation Errors. This error class occurs when the agent fails to evaluate the outcome of an action and adjust its subsequent action. The deficiency typically stems from an inability to learn from the action histories and modify future behavior accordingly. As shown in Fig. 7(b), when tasked to Get the search results for the short videos Stephen Curry. Select the first Short in the results and like it. Leave comment good shot!, The agent successfully uses shortcuts to search for the video. However, at the step requiring it to select the first video, it fails to switch to GUI-based action and instead erroneously calls the open shorts() shortcut again. This results in an unproductive loop, demonstrating failure to adapt its operational mode based on the tasks state. Execution and Formulation Errors. This type of error is specific to the invocation of agent-generated shortcuts. As noted in the main text, the execution success rate for these shortcuts is considerably low. Failures typically result from the shortcut being poorly formulated during the generation phase, rendering it inherently flawed or not robust enough to handle slight variations in the UI during execution. Figure 6: Examples of the resulting shortcut types. Action Replay shortcuts (Task-Level and Subtask-Level) use sequence of actions with fixed indices, while Dynamic Shortcuts use variable arguments that correspond to UI elements. generated diverse set of agent-generated shortcuts using various methods. We employ M3A as our baseline agent to generate different types of shortcuts. Without altering its core operational logic, M3A autonomously explores the environment and generates task execution trajectories, utilizing Gemini2.5-Pro as its base model. Upon completing each task, we construct prompt containing the task instruction, the whole action history, and the reasoning for each step. This prompt is then provided to Gemini-2.5-Pro, generating the corresponding shortcuts. Examples of the resulting shortcut types are shown in Fig. 6. As detailed in Table 8, this process resulted in 46 Subtask-level Macro-Replay, 45 Dynamic, 39 Task-level Macro-Replay, and 36 MobileAgent-E shortcuts.
