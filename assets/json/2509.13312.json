            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2025b; Qwen Team, 2025; Liu et al., 2024; DeepMind, 2025; anthropic, 2025) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across wide array of well-defined tasks, from factual question answering (Wei et al., 2025; Mialon et al., 2023) to document summarization (Zhang et al., 2025) and code generation (Jiang et al., 2024). Their success, however, has largely been confined to scenarios with clear instructions and ground-truth answers. The true frontier for autonomous AI lies in transcending these structured problems to tackle the complex, open-ended challenges that define human-level knowledge worka process driven by curiosity, synthesis, and the discovery of novel insights. We term this challenge open-ended deep research (OEDR). Unlike tasks with ground-truth answers, OEDR requires an agent to independently navigate and digest vast corpus of information, often exceeding 100 web pages and PDFs, to form detailed report that offers unique, synthesized viewpoints. This represents monumental challenge, and as shown in Fig. 1, most current agents fail dramatically on the recent benchmarks (Du et al., 2025; Consult, 2025; Coelho et al., 2025) designed to test this capability, highlighting critical gap we aim to address. Current attempts to tackle OEDR fall into two main categories: proprietary and open-source solutions. While several powerful proprietary agents exist (OpenAI, 2025a; Research, 2025b;d;a), their prohibitively expensive APIs and restrictive quotas create significant barriers, limiting widespread adoption and hindering academic research. Consequently, the focus has shifted towards open-source alternatives, which predominantly follow two paradigms. As shown in Fig. 2, the first is straightforward \"searchthen-generate\" approach (Tao et al., 2025; Roucher et al., 2025), where the agent gathers all information before directly generating report. This method often results in low-quality, incoherent outputs because it lacks guiding outline to structure the synthesis. The second, more sophisticated approach first generates static outline and then performs targeted searches for each section (Han et al., 2025; Research, 2025e;c). However, this strategy is critically flawed: the outline is fixed upfront, relying solely on the LLMs internal and often outdated knowledge. This rigidity \"fossilizes\" the research process, preventing the agent from exploring unexpected but valuable avenues discovered during its search. Furthermore, feeding all retrieved materials into single context for final generation is susceptible to well-known issues like loss in the middle (Liu et al., 2023) and increased hallucinations, compromising the reports accuracy and depth (Bai et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025c). The key, we believe, lies in abandoning rigid, machine-like pipelines and instead embracing the organic process of human intellect. Our approach is designed to do just that: it teaches the agent to research like person. human expert doesnt finalize their entire plan before starting; they allow their outline to be living document. We implement this principle through an agentic loop where actions of searching and outline optimization are provided. As the agent explores the web-scale information landscape, its discoveries continuously inform and reshape the outline. This allows for genuine exploration and adaptation, ensuring that the research is not confined to its initial, limited understanding. Then, when it is time to write, our agent avoids the brute-force method of \"reading\" everything at once. Just as human writer would refer to specific notes for specific chapter, our agent composes each section by focusing only on the most pertinent source materials. By doing so, it operates with clarity and precision, crafting final report that is not just summary of data but well-structured and deeply considered piece of analysis. To this end, we propose WebWeaver by following the human-centric philosophy, dual-agent framework comprising planner and writer. As shown in Fig. 2, the planner embodies the exploratory research phase, operating in dynamic cycle that iteratively interleaves evidence acquisition with outline optimization, culminating in comprehensive, source-grounded research outline, where each section is explicitly linked via citations to curated memory bank of source evidence. When it turns to the writing phase, to address the critical long context and attentional management challenge, the writer executes memory-grounded, hierarchical synthesis process. It constructs the report section by section, performing 2 Figure 2: Paradigm comparison: (a) the search-then-generate paradigm first gathers information and then directly generates report; (b) the paradigm initializes static outline and then performs targeted searches for the outline; (c) WebWeaver not only enables dynamic research cycle where the outline and search strategy co-evolve but allows hierarchical and attentional writing by retrieving only relevant evidence. targeted retrieval of only the relevant evidence from structured memory bank for each subtask. This synergistic division of labor enables our agent to navigate complex information landscapes and produce reports that are both comprehensive in scope and meticulous in their evidentiary grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WebWeaver achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and outperforms both the proprietary and open-source agent systems on three recent and challenging openended deep research benchmarks. Detailed discussion is produced to demonstrate the effectiveness of outline optimization and memory-grounded synthesis. Critically, to enhance the performance of the smaller models for practical use, we construct high-quality SFT dataset, WebWeaver-3k, generated by our framework. The supervised finetuning experiments with WebWeaver-3k demonstrate that the complex skills of thinking, searching, and writing can be distilled and taught, enabling smaller, accessible models to achieve the expert-level performance previously confined to large-scale proprietary systems."

            "title": "2 Preliminaries",
            "content": "Problem definition. We consider the open-ended research question without the ground-truth answers. Given an open-ended question, the agents need to search relevant information and finally output report or article. To achieve this, we implement planning agent for collecting information, memory to store materials, and writing agent for report generation. For both the planning and writing agents, we adopt ReAct (Yao et al., 2023) as the agents framework. Upon receiving question, the agents perform several iterations of thought-action-observation. Specifically, in each iteration, based on the existing context, the LLM generates thought and executes parsable action, then awaits the environment to return an observation. The planning and writing stages terminate with the output token of <terminate>. complete trajectory with iterations can be defined as HT = (τ0, a0, o0, . . . , τi, ai, oi, . . . , τT, aT), (1) where τi, ai, oi represent thought, action, and observation sampled from the planning or writing policy based on all previous context in the i-th round, respectively. 3 Actions. For the planner, the action space consists of search, write outline, and terminate. Given the search queries, the search engine returns titles, snippets, and corresponding URLs. To save context space, we further execute the actions of the URL selection, parsing the page via URL, summarizing relevant contents, and extracting evidence with LLMs following the searching queries. The search tool finally returns the selected URLs and their corresponding summaries. The action of write outline is to generate and optimize the outline, and the terminate action is to terminate the planning process. For the writer, the action space consists of retrieve, write, and terminate. Besides the terminate action, the retrieve action is to retrieve evidence from the memory bank by providing the grounded citations in the outline. The write action is provided to write the section of the report. Memory bank. Answering an open-ended question requires long-context input of the collected information and long-context output of the final report. To search sufficient materials, the planner often searches and parses more than 100 web pages, with more than 100k tokens. The writer often outputs more than 20k tokens to produce comprehensive report. Prior open-sourced deep research agents (Roucher et al., 2025; Research, 2025e;c) include all the raw materials (e.g., web pages and PDF files) in the LLM context, leading to quality degradation due to attentional failures like the lost in the middle problem, poor coherence, and increased hallucinations (Liu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025c). To this end, we introduce memory to achieve context management for both planner and writer. Only short summary of the web page or PDF file is included in the search context, and only necessary raw pages will be retrieved from the memory to write the corresponding sections."

It iteratively interleaves evidence acquisition from web searches with the continuous refinement and optimization of report outline. The output of this exploratory phase is not just collection of sources but comprehensive, well-structured outline where each section is explicitly linked via citations to curated memory bank of source evidence. Subsequently, the writer takes over for the synthesis phase. To circumvent the pitfalls of one-shot generation and long-context issues, the writer adopts section-wise and memory-grounded synthesis approach. For each section of the outline, it performs targeted retrieval of only the pertinent evidence from the memory bank and composes the content. This division of labor ensures that the final report is not only coherent and well-organized but also deeply source-grounded, faithfully mirroring the rigor of human-led deep research."

            "title": "3.2 Research Cycle: Iterative Evidence Acquisition and Outline Optimization",
            "content": "Recent deep research agents often follow an \"outline-guided search\" paradigm (Han et al., 2025; Research, 2025e;c). By generating static outline before any evidence is gathered, they create rigid research path that is blind to emergent insights. This fundamental decoupling of planning from discovery limits the depth and breadth of the research. We address this by proposing dynamic research cycle where the outline and search strategy co-evolve, allowing the agent to adapt and explore new findings. The core of our planners operation is dynamic research cycle that iteratively interleaves evidence 4 Figure 3: The workflow of WeaWeaver. Left: The planner first iteratively collects evidence via the search tool and optimizes the outline until outputting comprehensive and citation-grounded outline. Right: The writer performs hierarchical and attentional writing by retrieving relevant evidence with the grounded citation in the outline. acquisition with outline optimization. Unlike static approaches, our planner continuously adapts its strategy based on emergent findings. For each step, the planner selects one of the three actions: search, outline optimization, and terminate. Evidence acquisition. When there is still insufficient evidence or knowledge to make comprehensive outline to answer the open-ended question, the planner will continue collecting evidence by executing the search action. Given any search queries, the planner begins by querying web search engine, which returns the results that contain the raw URLs with corresponding snippets and titles. To combat the contextual noise and processing overhead from raw URLs, it employs two-stage filtering process. First, we prompt LLMs to select only the relevant URLs based on titles and snippets. Then, for each parsed page of the selected URLs, we perform two critical actions: leveraging LLMs to (1) distill query-relevant summary, which is fed back into the planners context to inform subsequent search iterations, and (2) extract verifiable, detailed evidence (e.g., quotes, data points), which is stored in structured memory bank for the subsequent writing. Outline optimization. After acquiring some evidence, the planner revisits the reports outline. This is not one-time generation step but process of continuous refinement and optimization. The planner uses the newly acquired information to expand sections, add new subsections, or even restructure the entire outline to better reflect comprehensive understanding of the topic. Crucially, it populates the outline with citations, mapping each section to the specific evidence IDs in the memory bank. This citation mechanism is vital for ensuring source-groundedness and enabling the hierarchical writing process in the next stage. This iterative loop continues until the planner outputs terminate action with tag <terminate> when the outline is sufficiently comprehensive and well-supported by evidence."

            "title": "3.3 Memory-Grounded Synthesis: Hierarchical Retrieval and Writing",
            "content": "A pivotal challenge in generating long-form reports is not just information access but attentional management. The prevailing approach of feeding all gathered evidence into single context window for 5 one-shot generation is fundamentally flawed. This brute-force method saturates the models attentional capacity, leading to some long-context issues like loss in the middle (Liu et al., 2023), where crucial details are overlooked, and contextual bleeding (Liu et al., 2025), where information from one section incorrectly influences the synthesis of another. We argue that successful synthesis process must mirror human cognition by breaking down the complex task of long-context, one-step writing into manageable subtasks of attentional writing with only relevant evidence. Therefore, we adopt hierarchical, divideand-conquer strategy, where the report is constructed sequentially, with the models focus constrained to only the most relevant evidence at each step. Upon completion of the planning phase, the writer is provided with the structured, source-grounded outline and access to the evidence memory bank. The composition of each section is not single, monolithic action but deliberate, intra-sectional reasoning cycle designed to ensure both accuracy and coherence. This cycle unfolds as follows: First, the writer identifies its immediate subtask, such as Lets write the first section. It then executes targeted retrieval action, pulling only the relevant evidence from the memory bank as indicated by the outlines citations. Upon receiving the evidence, the writer enters crucial internal reasoning phase with think action. In this thinking step, it analyzes the retrieved content, synthesizes key insights, selects the most compelling pieces of evidence, and formulates coherent narrative structure for the section. This internal monologue is critical for moving beyond simple summarization to genuine synthesis. Only after this internal synthesis plan is formed does the writer proceed to the writing action, composing the prose and encapsulating it within <write> tags. Once section is complete, its corresponding source materials are explicitly pruned from the context window and replaced with placeholder message. This dynamic retrieval-and-pruning mechanism is the cornerstone of our approach: it ensures the writers context remains highly relevant for the next cycle, mitigates context overflow, and prevents cross-sectional interference. This entire process repeats hierarchically for all sections until the writer outputs final <terminate> token, signaling the completion of the full report."

            "content": "Results on DeepResearch Bench. As presented in Table 1, our WebWeaver framework establishes new state-of-the-art, consistently outperforming existing agents. This superior performance is direct result of our dual-agent, iterative methodology. The high scores in comprehensiveness (Comp.) and insight stem from the planners dynamic research cycle, which iteratively expands the reports scope based on emergent findings, unlike the rigid outline-first approaches. This process naturally leads to higher number of effective citations (Eff. c.), as the planner is intrinsically motivated to seek more evidence to ensure that each section is well-supported. Furthermore, the remarkable citation accuracy (C. acc.) of 93.37% is achieved by the strong synergy between our agents: the planner embeds specific citation IDs into the outline, and the writers hierarchical synthesis process uses this structure for targeted retrieval. By focusing only on relevant evidence for each section, it drastically reduces context-bleeding and hallucinations, which also contributes to the enhanced readability (Read.) and Instruction-following (Inst.) scores. This demonstrates that by emulating human research patterns, our framework produces not just more thorough but also significantly more reliable and well-structured reports. Results on DeepConsult and DeepResearchGym. To validate the generalizability of our framework, we further evaluated WebWeaver on the DeepConsult and DeepResearchGym benchmarks, with results presented in Table 2. Our method demonstrates clear superiority on both, achieving the highest win rate (66.86%) on DeepConsult and the top average score (96.77) on DeepResearchGym. This success is rooted in our core design. The near-perfect scores in Depth (100.00) and Breadth (100.00) are direct result of the planners iterative research cycle, which relentlessly expands the reports scope beyond the limits of static planning. Concurrently, the writers hierarchical synthesis process ensures these comprehensive findings are well-organized, leading to outstanding scores in balance (94.30) and support (98.73). In essence, the quantitative dominance in structural metrics like depth and breadth on DeepResearchGym provides clear explanation for the qualitative victories on DeepConsult, proving that our human-inspired, iterative process is fundamentally more robust strategy for complex information synthesis tasks."

This empirically invalidates static-outline approaches and shows the tangible benefit of our iterative process: it produces richer, more comprehensive plan that adapts to discovery. This deep planning phase amasses staggering amount of informationover 100 saved pages, culminating in 67k evidence tokens and 15k summary tokens. This sheer volume makes single-context approach computationally hard, thus mandating our memory-centric architecture with targeted retrieval as foundational requirement, not just an optimization. Finally, the writers process of composing 26k-token report in 25 discrete writing steps validates that our hierarchical synthesis is practical way to maintain coherence over long outputs. In essence, the statistics of searching and writing affirm that each component of WebWeaver is necessary and beneficial response to the inherent challenges of OEDR. Figure 5: End-to-end scores with varying rounds of outline optimization on Deepresearch Bench. Figure 6: End-to-end scores with varying rounds of outline optimization on DeepresearchGym. End-to-end benchmark comparison for varying rounds of outlines. To isolate and quantify the benefits of outline optimization, as reported in Fig. 5, 6, we conducted an ablation study by evaluating the end-to-end benchmark performance. We collect the samples with three-round outline optimization from 9 DeepResearch Bench and DeepResearchGym, adopting the same writing strategy for them. The benefits of this iterative refinement are evident across both benchmarks. On DeepResearch Bench, the overall score steadily climbs, driven primarily by significant gains in comprehensiveness (48.85 50.82) and insight (46.33 48.35). This directly validates our hypothesis that each optimization round allows the planner to build more detailed and logically structured outline. This enhanced structure is further reflected in DeepResearchGyms metrics, where later rounds achieve near-perfect scores in depth (100) and breadth (99.58), indicating more exhaustive topic coverage. Crucially, this is not just about adding more content; the steady rise in support (95.91 98.33) demonstrates that more refined outline creates better-scaffolded structure, enabling the writer to more tightly link claims to evidence. In summary, this analysis empirically demonstrates that iterative outline optimization is not redundant step but critical mechanism for elevating report from simple summary to deep, insightful, and well-supported piece of research. Figure 7: LLM-judged scores for varying rounds of outline optimization on Deepresearch Bench. Figure 8: LLM-judged scores for varying rounds of outline optimization on DeepresearchGym. LLM judgement for varying rounds of outlines. To directly evaluate whether our optimization truly improves outline quality, we utilized an LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng et al., 2023) to assess the outlines from each of the three optimization rounds using gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14 in terms of instruction following, depth, balance, breadth, support, and insightfulness. The judgment prompt is provided in Appendix A. The results in Fig. 7, 8 provide resounding confirmation of our iterative approach. On both benchmarks, the overall score for the outline quality shows significant, monotonic increase, jumping from 81.9 to 92.3 on DeepResearch Bench and from 77.2 to 88.2 on DeepResearchGym. This improvement is driven by clear gains in structural quality; the near-perfect scores in Depth (up to 95.71) and Breadth (up to 98.4) provide direct evidence that each optimization cycle successfully expands the researchs scope. Crucially, this is not mere expansion. The substantial increase in the Support score (e.g., from 51.2 to 73.6 on DeepResearchGym) is particularly revealing, indicating that later-round outlines are more effectively grounded with stronger mapping between planned sections and available evidence. This enhanced grounding and structure culminate in plan that is itself more insightful (improving by 10-15 scores on both benchmarks). Therefore, this direct assessment confirms that our iterative planner is not just adding content but is actively forging superior, more coherent, and better-supported blueprintthe foundational prerequisite for high-quality final report. Hierarchical retrieval and writing vs. brute-force writing. To empirically validate our hierarchical writing process, we conducted critical ablation study comparing our hierarchical writer against brute-force baseline that attempts to include the entire memory bank to generate the final report, which is similar to the workflow of LongWriter (Bai et al., 2025). The results are unequivocal: our hierarchical approach dramatically outperforms the brute-force method across every metric, confirming that divide and conquer strategy is essential. The most striking improvements are in insight (40.97 50.02) and readability (42.29 49.79), which directly validates our hypothesis on attentional management; by 10 Figure 9: Performance comparison between hierarchical writing and brute-force writing (LongWriter) on DeepResearch Bench. Figure 10: Performance comparison between hierarchical writing and brute-force writing (LongWriter) on DeepResearchGym. focusing the model on curated context for each section, it can perform deeper reasoning rather than shallow summarization. This is further substantiated by the leap in support on DeepResearchGym (91.82 98.73), proving that our targeted retrieval-and-pruning mechanism effectively prevents contextual bleeding and ensures claims are correctly grounded. In conclusion, these results provide definitive evidence that emulating the human cognitive process of focused, section-by-section writing is not merely beneficial choice but fundamental requirement for generating coherent, insightful, and reliable long-form reports. Figure 11: Round statistics of outline optimization on WebWeaver-SFT. Figure 12: Performance improvement of agentic finetuning on DeepResearch Bench. Agentic finetuning. While 30B-scale LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507) possess strong foundational capabilities, they often exhibit deficiencies in stability and instruction-following when executing complex, multi-turn tool-calling sequences over long contexts. To bridge this critical gap, we constructed high-quality Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) dataset: WebWeaver-3k. The process began by sourcing diverse set of queries crawled from the web, which were then processed by powerful, tier teacher model, instantiated within our WebWeaver agent framework. stringent filtering protocol was applied to the resulting end-to-end research trajectories, retaining only those where the agent successfully executed the entire workflow and strictly adhered to the predefined action format. This quality control yielded curated dataset of 3.3k high-fidelity planning trajectories and 3.1k writing trajectories. As detailed in Table 4 and Fig. 11, these trajectories encapsulate the profound complexity of the OEDR task, with an average case involving approximately 15 search steps, over two outline optimizations, and the processing 11 # Search step 14. # Outline token 4148.57 # Outline optimization 2.18 # Saved page 106.65 # Search query 18.8 # Evidence token 62637 # Summary token # Output token 22637 # Writing step 22.76 WebWeaver-SFT Planning statistics Writing statistics Table 4: The planning and writing statistics of training data on WebWeaver-SFT. of over 62,000 evidence tokens. By fine-tuning our base model on this data, we explicitly imbued it with the requisite long-sequence reasoning and tool-use capabilities to master our framework. The efficacy of our SFT strategy is quantitatively demonstrated by the significant performance gains across all benchmarks on Fig. 12, which directly reflect the models acquisition of our frameworks core competencies. The most dramatic validation is the leap in citation accuracy from nearly unusable 25% to reliable 85.90%. This provides direct, empirical evidence that the model has mastered the intricate mechanics of our Writer agent, learning to execute precise tool calls for evidence retrieval and faithfully write according to the source-grounded outline. Furthermore, the substantial increase in overall report quality, evidenced by the score on DeepConsult (4.57 6.09) and the massive jump on DeepResearchGym (77.27 90.89), reflects the successful acquisition of the planners more abstract abilities. These holistic improvements indicate that the model has learned the core loop of thinking (iteratively optimizing the outline) and searching (adaptively acquiring evidence), which is prerequisite for generating comprehensive and insightful final report. Ultimately, these results offer powerful dual validation: they prove that our WebWeaver framework is potent data generation engine, capable of deconstructing the formidable OEDR task into learnable demonstrations of thinking, searching, and writing, thereby enabling smaller model to achieve expert-level performance."

            "content": "Deep Research. Deep Research Agents have garnered significant attention for their powerful capabilities in information seeking, integration, and reasoning. Proprietary systems, such as DeepResearch (OpenAI, 2025a), Gemini Deep Research (google, 2025), and Claude Research (anthropic, 2025), have demonstrated performance comparable to human experts in domains like fact-checking and report writing. However, their opaque internal architectures and workflows hinder broader research and development. In the open-source community, many studies (Li et al., 2025b; Tao et al., 2025; Su et al., 2025; Qiao et al., 2025; Fang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a; Wu et al., 2025b;a) have been developed to tackle complex research benchmarks such as BrowseComp and GAIA by exploring methods like synthetic uncertain Question-Answering (QA) and formalized QA synthesis. Nevertheless, these solutions are primarily tailored for short-answer research queries and lack the capability to generate comprehensive, long-form reports on open-domain topics. Other open-source systems like OpenDeepResearch (Research, 2025e), GPT Researcher (Research, 2025c), and TTD-DR (Han et al., 2025) address long-form generation by first drafting static framework, then retrieving content, and finally composing the report. This approach, characterized by fixed structure and one-step generation, often leads to textual incoherence and hallucinations. In contrast, our method emphasizes the outline optimization and hierarchical writing processes to ensure the reports fluency and factual accuracy. Long Writing. Ensuring the coherence and accuracy of LLM-generated long-form text is persistent challenge. Previous work has explored methods like recursive prompting for story extension (Yang et al., 2022) and structured task decomposition to improve consistency (Yang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2025). More recently, agent-based frameworks have become mainstream solution. Systems like LongWriter (Bai et al., 2025) and CogWriter (Wan et al., 2025) employ \"plan-then-write\" strategy, where Planner Agent first creates an outline, and Generation Agent then conditions on this plan to produce the full text. However, these methods rely on static initial plan and brute-force writing strategy by feeding 12 all the evidence into LLMs. In contrast, our approach uniquely enables the outline to be dynamically optimized in tandem with the evidence acquisition process, allowing for comprehensive, sourcegrounded research outline. Furthermore, our proposed hierarchical writing process with only relevant evidence also mitigates the long-context issues from the brute-force writing strategy."

            "content": "In this paper, we introduced WebWeaver, novel dual-agent framework designed to overcome the fundamental flaws of static, machine-like pipelines in open-ended deep research (OEDR). By emulating the human cognitive process that integrates the planners dynamic research cycle with the writers hierarchical retrieval and writing process, WebWeaver consistently outperforms both proprietary and open-source systems, establishing new state-of-the-art. Beyond its superior performance, the true significance of WebWeaver lies in the new paradigm it offers the community for tackling complex, information-intensive tasks. It reframes the intractable challenge of long-context reasoning, demonstrating that it can be successfully deconstructed into structured problem of system-level information management, orchestrated through series of precise actions. Both the planner and writer are embodiments of this principle: they use tools to dynamically explore, structure, and write, rather than passively processing it in single pass. This work does not just present better agent system; it presents new blueprint for building the agent system that masters intensive knowledge through deliberate actions, not just brute-force attention."

The authors describe four-stage DBS pathway: pre-surgical decision making; the operation with required physical support and clinical goal-setting; post-operative changes in symptoms, behaviour and role dynamics; and finally re-engagement with life and future outlook. Post-operative care therefore extends beyond the surgical wound to include structured psychosocial supportcounselling, triadic nurse-patient-spouse meetings, and 18 possibly cognitive-behavioural therapyto help patients and partners negotiate new role boundaries, regain autonomy, and manage the \"burden of normality\" that can follow sudden functional gains. Daily-life adjustments reported by patients and spouses include shifting from combined caregiver-patient identity to more balanced spousal relationship, reclaiming personal interests, reducing over-protective behaviours, and actively addressing personal health and social needs. Preand post-DBS counseling, regular multidisciplinary follow-up, and interventions that foster positive psychology (e.g., character-strength exercises) are recommended to smooth these transitions and support long-term quality of life. </id_54> ... </tool_response> Step Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (MDS- <write_outline> Parkinsons Disease: Health Warning Signs, Family Alert Systems, and Post-DBS Care Strategies I.

Expect DBS activation about 4 weeks post-stage 1 and be patient with programming adjustments. Anticipate possible temporary confusionmaintain consistent routine, strict medication schedule, regular walking, and good sleep (melatonin if needed); arrange caregiver assistance especially if living alone. Monitor for fever, worsening incision signs, facial swelling, new neurological deficits, or worsening confusion, and contact the surgeon promptly.

Understanding Parkinsons Disease Progression and Warning Signs A. Disease Staging Systems Understanding Parkinsons disease progression requires familiarity with established staging systems that provide frameworks for recognizing symptom evolution and functional decline. These systems serve as critical tools for families to understand what to expect and when to seek medical intervention. 1. Hoehn and Yahr Scale Classifications The Hoehn and Yahr scale, originally published in 1967, remains the most widely used system for staging Parkinsons disease progression. <cite id=\"id_14,id_17\">This scale distinguishes between five stages of Parkinsons Disease, from unilateral impairment (Stage 1) to bilateral impairment, without postural control difficulties (Stage 2), to postural instability (Stage 3), to loss of physical independence (Stage 4) and finally, to wheelchair-bound or bed-bound (Stage 5)</cite>. The modified version includes intermediate stages that capture more nuanced progression patterns. <table> <caption>Hoehn and Yahr Scale Progression and Warning Signs</caption> <thead> <tr> <th>Stage</th> <th>Primary Characteristics</th> <th>Functional Impact</th> <th>Key Warning Signs for Families</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Stage 0</td> <td><cite id=\"id_12,id_21\">No signs of disease</cite></td> <td>Normal function</td> <td>Baseline monitoring period</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stage 1.0</td> <td><cite id=\"id_15,id_20\">Unilateral tremor, rigidity, reduced arm swing, and slowness present only on one side</cite></td> <td><cite id=\"id_2,id_6\">Minimal interference with daily activities</cite></td> <td>Subtle tremor in one finger, asymmetric arm swing</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stage 1.5</td> <td><cite id=\"id_15,id_21\">Unilateral involvement with axial symptoms like reduced facial expression, stooped posture, or reduced arm swing on both sides</cite></td> <td>Slight postural changes</td> <td>Facial masking, posture changes visible to family</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stage 2.0</td> <td><cite id=\"id_13,id_17\">Bilateral involvement without impairment of balance</cite></td> <td><cite id=\"id_2,id_6\">Daily activities become more difficult but independent living realistic</cite></td> <td>Tremor and stiffness on both sides, speech difficulties</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stage 2.5</td> <td><cite id=\"id_15,id_21\">Mild bilateral disease with recovery on pull test (taking 3 steps to recover balance)</cite></td> <td>Mild balance impairment</td> <td>Slight unsteadiness, requires multiple steps to recover balance</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stage 3.0</td> <td><cite id=\"id_13,id_20\">Mild to moderate bilateral disease with impaired postural reflexes; physically independent</cite></td> <td><cite id=\"id_2,id_6\">Falls become frequent, assistance needed for some activities</cite></td> <td>Loss of balance when pulled backward, increased fall risk</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stage 4.0</td> <td><cite id=\"id_13,id_20\">Severe disability; still able to walk or stand unassisted but markedly incapacitated</cite></td> <td><cite id=\"id_2,id_6\">Cannot live independently, requires walker or assistance</cite></td> <td>Need for assistive devices, inability to live alone safely</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stage 5.0</td> <td><cite id=\"id_13,id_21\">Wheelchair bound or bedridden unless aided</cite></td> <td><cite id=\"id_2,id_6\">Around-the-clock nursing care required, up to 50% experience hallucinations and delusions</cite></td> <td>Inability to stand or walk, cognitive disturbances, complete dependency</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> This staging system reveals several critical insights for families. **The transition from Stage 2 to Stage 3 marks pivotal point** where balance problems emerge, fundamentally changing the patients safety profile and care needs. <cite id=\"id_20\">Loss of balance, with the inability to make the rapid, automatic and involuntary movements necessary to protect against falling, is one of the most troubling and dangerous aspects of Parkinsonism and one of the least easily treated</cite>. Understanding this progression helps families anticipate when environmental modifications and increased supervision become essential. **The distinction between Stage 3 and Stage 4 centers on independence**. <cite id=\"id_20\">The most important factor identifying Stage III (as opposed to stage IV) is that the patient is still fully independent in all activities of daily living (dressing, hygiene, eating, etc.), while Stage IV patients are unable to lead an independent life because of the need for help with some activities of daily living</cite>. This transition signals when families must consider more intensive caregiving arrangements or assisted living options. </write> Step 3 <think> Now need to continue with information about the MDS-UPDRS system and disease progression timeline. Let me retrieve more specific information about these aspects. </think> <tool_call> {\"name\": \"search\", \"arguments\": {\"url_id\": [\"id_3\", \"id_16\", \"id_17\", \"id_19\"], \"goal\": \"Gather 32 information about MDS-UPDRS assessment system, disease progression timeline, and transition indicators between stages\"}} </tool_call> <tool_response> The page content for the previous section has been masked for saving the space. </tool_response> Step <think> The tool response provides valuable information about the MDS-UPDRS system, disease progression timeline, and the critical transition point at Stage 3. can see that: 1. MDS-UPDRS has replaced the older Hoehn-Yahr system as the main assessment tool 2. The progression timeline shows median transition times between stages (20-26 months typically) 3. Stage 3 (HY > 3) represents critical threshold marking advanced disease with increased disability, medication-refractory features, and cognitive decline 4. Theres important information about non-motor symptoms appearing years before motor symptoms 5. Specific progression warning signs are detailed should continue writing about the MDS-UPDRS system and progression timeline, then move on to early stage warning signs. </think> <tool_call> {\"name\": \"search\", \"arguments\": [\"DBS patient daily living support family caregivers\", \"Parkinson DBS lifestyle modifications comfort strategies\", \"DBS programming adjustment patient family guide\"], \"goal\": \"Find specific daily life support strategies, comfort measures, and family guidance for caring for Parkinsons patients who have undergone DBS surgery\"}} </tool_call> <write> <write> 2. Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) While the Hoehn and Yahr scale remains valuable for understanding disease progression, <cite id=\"id_3\">the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is healthcare providers main tool to classify this disease. The MDS-UPDRS examines four different areas of how Parkinsons disease affects you</cite>. This comprehensive assessment tool provides more nuanced evaluation of both motor and non-motor symptoms, addressing the limitations of purely stage-based approaches. **The significance of this shift toward individualized assessment cannot be overstated**. Rather than simply categorizing patients into stages, the MDS-UPDRS recognizes that Parkinsons disease affects each person differently, requiring personalized treatment approaches. This evolution in assessment methodology reflects our growing understanding that the diseases impact extends far beyond motor symptoms. 3. Disease Progression Timeline and Transition Indicators Understanding the temporal aspects of Parkinsons progression helps families prepare for changing care needs. <cite id=\"id_17\">Median transition times between stages show Stage 2 progression occurring around 20 months, with subsequent stages progressing every 24-26 months</cite>. However, <cite id=\"id_16\">for some people, it can take as long as 20 years to move through all the stages</cite>, emphasizing the highly variable nature of disease progression. **The transition to Stage 3 represents critical threshold** in Parkinsons disease progression. <cite id=\"id_19\">Transitions from scores of 2.5 to scores of 3 on the modified HY scale 33 mark worsening in quality of life and an increase in the risk of medication-refractory disease features such as dementia and mortality</cite>. This transition point signals when families must significantly intensify their care planning and support strategies. The underlying pathophysiology also changes at this critical juncture. <cite id=\"id_19\">Although striatal dopaminergic neuropathology accounts for many of the early motor features of PD, in vivo imaging studies suggest floor effects to striatal dopaminergic denervation that occur both in early PD and at HY stage 3 disease, at which point progressive disease burden is driven by other factors</cite>. This shift from primarily dopaminergic to multi-system pathology explains why treatment becomes more complex and why families observe new types of symptoms emerging. B. Early Stage Warning Signs (Stages 1-2) Early recognition of Parkinsons disease symptoms enables timely medical intervention and better long-term outcomes. The challenge for families lies in distinguishing between normal aging changes and early disease manifestations. 1. Motor Symptoms The classic motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease typically appear gradually and asymmetrically. <cite id=\"id_3\">Motor symptoms which means movement-related symptoms of Parkinsons disease include tremor at rest, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity (muscle stiffness), and postural instability (balance problems)</cite>. **Tremor characteristics provide important diagnostic clues**. The typical Parkinsons tremor occurs at rest, often beginning subtly in one finger or hand. Families should note that this tremor typically diminishes during purposeful movement, distinguishing it from other types of tremors. The asymmetric onset is particularly significantsymptoms beginning on one side of the body are more suggestive of Parkinsons disease than bilateral symptoms. **Bradykinesia manifests in multiple ways** that families can observe in daily activities. This slowness of movement affects not only gross motor activities but also fine motor skills, leading to characteristic changes in handwriting (micrographia), reduced facial expression (facial masking), and decreased arm swing during walking. These changes often develop so gradually that they may be attributed to normal aging until they become more pronounced. **Rigidity and postural changes** represent another category of early motor symptoms. Families may notice increased muscle stiffness, particularly in the neck and shoulders, leading to complaints of aching or discomfort. The development of stooped posture and reduced arm swing during walking are early indicators that warrant medical evaluation. 2. Non-Motor Early Indicators Perhaps most significantly for early detection, <cite id=\"id_3\">many of the possible non-motor symptoms can appear years or even decades ahead of motor symptoms</cite>. This extended prodromal period offers families crucial opportunities for early intervention, though the subtlety of these symptoms often leads to delayed recognition. **Olfactory dysfunction represents one of the earliest detectable changes**. <cite id=\"id_3\">Loss of sense of smell (anosmia)</cite> occurs in approximately 90% of Parkinsons patients, often years before motor symptoms appear. Families should take note when loved one reports that food no longer tastes the same or when they fail to detect strong odors that others notice readily. **Gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly constipation**, frequently precede motor symptoms by years. <cite id=\"id_3\">Constipation</cite> in Parkinsons disease results from the same pathological processes affecting the brain, specifically involving the enteric nervous system. This symptom is often dismissed as age-related or dietary, but persistent constipation without clear cause warrants medical attention. **Sleep disturbances provide another early warning system**. <cite id=\"id_3\">Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder</cite> is particularly significant, as it involves acting out dreams during sleep, potentially including violent movements or vocalizations. <cite 34 id=\"id_16\">REM sleep behavior disorder can also happen in people who dont have Parkinsons. However, if this isnt something youve dealt with before, its likely related to your disease</cite>. Family members sharing bed are often the first to notice these changes. <cite **Neuropsychiatric id=\"id_3\">Depression or anxiety</cite> can appear years before motor symptoms, and <cite id=\"id_16\">anxiety and depression have been linked to Parkinsons. In addition to movement problems, the disease can also have an impact on your mental health</cite>. These mood changes may be subtle initially but can significantly impact quality of life and relationships. </write> symptoms deserve particular attention** from families. Step 5 <think> Now need to continue with information about progressive stage warning signs and advanced stage warning signs. Let me retrieve more specific information about these later stages and their complications. </think> <tool_call> {\"name\": \"retrieve\", \"arguments\": {\"url_id\": [\"id_5\", \"id_6\", \"id_18\", \"id_22\"], \"goal\": \"Gather detailed information about progressive and advanced stage warning signs, including motor and non-motor complications\"}} </tool_call> <tool_response> The page content for the previous section has been masked for saving the space. </tool_response> Step 6 <think> The tool response provides excellent detailed information about progressive and advanced stage warning signs. can see clear patterns in the progression from mild to moderate to advanced stages, with specific motor and non-motor symptoms at each stage. The information shows how symptoms evolve from unilateral to bilateral, how functional independence is progressively lost, and how non-motor symptoms become increasingly prominent and disabling. should organize this information to show the progression clearly and highlight the key warning signs families need to recognize. </think> <write> C. Progressive Stage Warning Signs (Stages 2-3) As Parkinsons disease advances beyond the early stage, families observe more pronounced symptoms that begin to significantly impact daily functioning. This progressive phase represents critical period where proactive intervention can substantially influence quality of life outcomes. 1. Advancing Motor Symptoms **The bilateral spread of symptoms marks fundamental shift** in disease progression. <cite id=\"id_18\">As the disease progresses, it eventually affects both sides. However, the symptoms may still be more severe on one side than on the other</cite>. This bilateral involvement signals that families must adapt their support strategies to address more comprehensive functional limitations. <cite id=\"id_22\">Often within 3 to 7 years, youll see more changes. Early on, you might have little trouble with something like buttoning shirt. At this point, you may not be able to do it at all</cite>. **This progression from mild difficulty to complete inability** represents pattern families will observe across multiple daily activities, requiring gradual assumption of caregiving responsibilities. **Speech and swallowing changes become particularly noticeable** during this stage. <cite id=\"id_5\">You may speak softly or quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be flat or monotone, without typical speech patterns</cite>. These changes affect not only communication but also safety, as <cite id=\"id_22\">trouble swallowing</cite> increases the risk of aspiration and nutritional deficiencies. **Gait disturbances and freezing episodes** represent some of the most challenging aspects of progressive Parkinsons disease. <cite id=\"id_18\">People with Parkinsons disease often develop parkinsonian gait that includes tendency to lean forward; take small, quick steps; and reduce swinging their arms. They also may have trouble initiating or continuing movement</cite>. The emergence of <cite id=\"id_22\">freezing when you first start to walk or change direction, as if your feet are glued to the ground</cite> creates significant safety concerns and mobility limitations. 2. Emerging Complications **Medication effectiveness begins to fluctuate** during the progressive stage, creating new challenges for symptom management. <cite id=\"id_22\">You might also find that the medicine you take starts to wear off between doses</cite>. This \"wearing-off\" phenomenon requires families to become more attentive to timing of medications and to recognize when symptoms return between doses. **Balance problems and fall risk increase substantially**. <cite id=\"id_6\">At this stage, falls become more frequent due to balance and reflex problems</cite>, and <cite id=\"id_22\">falls to be more likely</cite>. This increased fall risk necessitates environmental modifications and potentially the introduction of assistive devices. 3. Functional Impact Assessment **The distinction between Stages 2 and 3 centers on independence preservation**. <cite id=\"id_6\">Due to the various issues this stage presents, daily tasks are much more difficult to do, but people can still live independently. combination of medication and therapy can help to manage the symptoms mentioned above</cite>. Understanding this threshold helps families recognize when to increase support while still encouraging independence. D. Advanced Stage Warning Signs (Stages 4-5) The advanced stages of Parkinsons disease present complex challenges that require comprehensive care planning and family coordination. These stages are characterized by severe functional limitations and the emergence of complications that significantly impact quality of life. 1. Severe Motor Impairment **Stage 4 marks the loss of independent living capability**. <cite id=\"id_6\">The critical factor in separating people with stage 3 Parkinsons and stage 4 is independence. Motor skills and deep brain stimulation are heavily impacted at stage 4 and as such, movement symptoms affect persons ability to retain their independence</cite>. This transition requires families to make difficult decisions about living arrangements and care provision. <cite id=\"id_22\">At this point, you likely: Are limited to bed or wheelchair, Cant live on your own, Have severe posture issues in your neck, back, and hips, Need help with daily tasks</cite>. **The comprehensive nature of these limitations** means that families must coordinate multiple aspects of care, from basic hygiene to mobility assistance. **Stage 5 represents the most severe manifestation** of motor symptoms. <cite id=\"id_6\">Severe stiffness can make it difficult, if not impossible, for person to stand or walk. This is due to stiffness causing the legs to essentially freeze when the patient attempts to stand</cite>. This \"freezing\" phenomenon at the advanced stage differs qualitatively from earlier freezing episodes, representing more permanent limitation rather than intermittent difficulty. 2. Complex Non-Motor Complications **Cognitive decline becomes prominent feature** in advanced stages. <cite id=\"id_18\">Over time, as the disease progresses, some people may develop dementia and be diagnosed with 36 Parkinsons dementia, type of Lewy body dementia. People with Parkinsons dementia may have severe memory and thinking problems that affect daily living</cite>. This cognitive impairment adds another layer of complexity to caregiving responsibilities. **Psychiatric symptoms emerge as significant challenges**. <cite id=\"id_6\">Furthermore, up to 50% of Parkinsons patients in stages 4 and 5 experience confusion, hallucinations, and delusions. For clarity, hallucinations are seeing things that arent really there, and delusions are when person believes something despite evidence to the contrary</cite>. These symptoms can be particularly distressing for families and may require specialized psychiatric intervention. **Swallowing and nutritional complications** become life-threatening concerns. <cite id=\"id_5\">Late-stage Parkinsons disease affects the muscles in the mouth. This causes trouble swallowing and chewing, which can lead to not getting enough nutrients in your diet. If food or saliva collects in the mouth, it can cause choking or drooling</cite>. These complications require careful monitoring and may necessitate alternative feeding methods. <table> <caption>Progressive Warning Signs by Disease Stage</caption> <thead> <tr> <th>Stage</th> <th>Motor Warning Signs</th> <th>Non-Motor Warning Signs</th> <th>Functional Impact</th> <th>Family Action Required</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Early (1-2)</td> <td>Unilateral tremor, mild rigidity, reduced arm swing, micrographia</td> <td>Sleep disturbances, constipation, loss of smell, mood changes</td> <td>Minimal daily life disruption</td> <td>Medical evaluation, symptom monitoring</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Progressive (2-3)</td> <td>Bilateral symptoms, gait freezing, speech changes, balance problems</td> <td>Medication wearing-off, cognitive changes, swallowing difficulty</td> <td>Increased difficulty with daily tasks, still independent</td> <td>Environmental modifications, fall prevention, medication timing</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Advanced (4-5)</td> <td>Severe rigidity, wheelchair/bed bound, postural deformities</td> <td>Dementia, hallucinations, severe dysphagia, autonomic failure</td> <td>Complete dependency for daily activities</td> <td>24-hour care, safety monitoring, end-of-life planning</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> **The temporal progression of non-motor symptoms** follows predictable pattern that families should understand. <cite id=\"id_22\">What may show up early. You may have these issues years before any classic motor symptoms like tremors: Constipation, Depression, Loss of smell, Low blood pressure when you stand up, Pain, Sleep issues</cite>. Conversely, <cite id=\"id_22\">What may show up later. Dementia and psychosis are two serious mental health issues that usually take while to show up</cite>. This progression pattern reveals that **non-motor symptoms often become more disabling than motor symptoms** in advanced stages. <cite id=\"id_22\">Almost everyone with Parkinsons gets at least one of these. When severe, theyre more likely than motor issues to lead to disability or make you move into nursing home</cite>. This insight helps families understand why comprehensive care planning must address both motor and non-motor aspects of the disease. 37 3. End-Stage Considerations **The advanced stage requires families to confront difficult realities** about prognosis and care goals. <cite id=\"id_22\">After about 10 years, most people will have at least one major issue, like dementia or physical disability</cite>. Understanding this timeline helps families engage in advance care planning while the patient can still participate in decision-making. **The variability in progression** means that some individuals may never reach the most severe stages, while others progress more rapidly. <cite id=\"id_22\">Some people never reach this stage</cite> of advanced disability, emphasizing the importance of individualized care planning rather than assuming inevitable decline. </write> Step <think> Now need to move on to the second major section about critical warning signs requiring immediate medical intervention. This is crucial information for families to know when to seek emergency care.
