            "content": "Accurately modeling human preferences remains fundamental challenge that resides at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction (Doyle, 2004). As language models (LMs) are increasingly deployed within nuanced and complex social contexts, the precise prediction of human judgments is crucial for model development and trustworthy personalization. In this work, we define preference modeling as the task of predicting evaluative judgments over content. In the context of machine learning, modern preference modeling techniques have typically originated as components within recommendation systems or alignment pipelines (Schafer et al., 2007; Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022). While such approaches perform adequately under controlled settings, they struggle in real-world contexts that require nuanced social understanding. Our work addresses this gap with PrefPalette, framework that explicitly models the attribute-mediated cognitive processes underlying human preference judgments, demonstrating improvements in prediction accuracy and interpretability across diverse social domains. Despite its central role in personalization and alignment, preference modeling has received limited attention as standalone research direction. Instead, most work embeds preference learning as component within RLHF pipelines without accounting for the cognitive mechanisms that govern human preference formation. Moreover, these methods rely on explicit, self-reported annotations(Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022), suffer from social-desirability bias (Furnham, 1986; Paulhus, 1991) and fail to capture actual preferences from unobtrusive, real-world signals (e.g., engagement metrics). For instance, as Figure 1 (left) shows, annotators may opt for the more respectable, cultured\" option over the fun\" option due to response bias. 1 Figure 1 Comparison between conventional direct preference modeling (left) and PrefPalette, our attribute-mediated preference modeling approach (right). Attribute-mediated preference modeling better aligns with human cognitive evaluation processes by incorporating explicit attribute dimensions as interpretable intermediaries between content and preference. To mitigate annotation bias, some studies incorporate auxiliary information signals such as online engagement metrics, temporal metadata (Park et al., 2024a), or explicit user identifiers (Kumar et al., 2024). Such attempts still operate within direct content-to-preference paradigm and overlook the attribute-mediated structure documented in cognitive science. Another thread of research is multi-objective reward modeling, which involves decomposing rewards into interpretable dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, coherence, verbosity) and recombining them (Li et al., 2025a; Zhou et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a,b; Zhou et al., 2024). Yet by relying on broad, pre-annotated scalar ratings (Wang et al., 2024a,b), these approaches miss the more granular, latent attributessuch as core human valuesthat fundamentally drive preference judgments (Schwartz, 1992). We propose to tackle this challenge by leveraging insights from cognitive science research, which has established that human preference formation follows process known as multi-attribute decision making. In multi-attribute decision making, individuals decompose options into distinct attribute dimensions that serve as evaluation criteria (Slovic, 1995; Bettman et al., 1998; Kahneman, 2011). These attributes are dynamically weighted based on context (Fischer et al., 1999; Hsee et al., 2003). Here, we define attributes as interpretable characteristics of content that influence human evaluationsuch as the formality of language, the presence of humor, or the expression of cultural values such as empathy or achievement. These attributes are latent because they are not explicitly labeled in preference data; instead, they must be inferred from the content itself. For example, humor is highly valued in stand-up comedy but less so in news reporting. This multi-stage process creates an internal evaluative structure that cannot be discerned from final preference judgments alone. Current preference modeling approaches bypass this cognitive architecture, missing the underlying evaluative processes that are formative to human preferences (Stiennon et al., 2020). To this end, we introduce Preference Palette (PrefPalette), preference modeling framework that is grounded on the cognitively motivated structures that underlie human evaluative judgment and leverages unobtrusive preference signals from naturalistic interactions (Figure 1). Our approach is the first to bridge fundamental gap between black-box preference modeling systems and multi-attribute decision making. Specifically, PrefPalette employs two-stage process: (1) attribute representation learning, which involves generating scalable counterfactual data to train specialized attribute predictors, and (2) attribute-mediated preference modeling, which involves learning context-dependent attribute weights and incorporating them into preference models. We focus on two broad attribute categories that influence human preferences: 9 common sociolinguistic norms (e.g., toxicity, politeness, humor) that capture communication style (Hern√°ndezCampoy, 2016; Lapinski and Rimal, 2005), and 10 Schwartz value dimensions (Schwartz, 2012) that represent fundamental human values (e.g., benevolence, conformity). We instantiate PrefPalette on Reddit (Baumgartner et al., 2020) data, which is also one of the largest and most accessible open repositories of naturally-arising, community-specific interactions. The individual communities on Reddit, known as subreddits, offer distinct social niches with sharply differing norms, creating rich testbed for model robustness. PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by 46.6% across 45 diverse social contexts in preference accuracy and demonstrates strong temporal robustness. Beyond predictive improvements, PrefPalette also reveals intuitive community preference patterns (e.g., r/AskHistorians values verbosity, and r/MaliciousCompliance values sarcasm). Human evaluation validates that our PrefPalette models 2 Figure 2 PrefPalette framework overview. In this framework, we first train specialized attribute predictors using counterfactual data, then integrate their hidden representations via attention mechanisms to predict preferences, while learning context-dependent attribute importance weights. attention weights accurately reflect attribute-preference relationships; high-importance attributes show positive correlations with community preferences, while low-importance attributes show near-zero correlations. Our contributions include: computational framework that explicitly incorporates attribute-mediated evaluation processes into preference modeling, aligning AI systems with cognitive science theories of human judgment; counterfactual knowledge distillation technique that efficiently teaches attribute understanding capabilities from larger models to small, specialized predictors; Empirical evidence that shows superior preference prediction accuracy and temporal robustness across diverse social contexts compared to state-of-the-art baselines; Behavioral interpretability through per-instance, per-community attention weights, that reveals which sociolinguistic norms and cultural values govern preferences and facilitate transparent personalization."

            "content": "Counterfactual Attribute Synthesis Traditional approaches to learning nuanced latent attributes face significant methodological limitations: (i) naturally occurring texts contain confounding variables via attribute correlations (Shah et al., 2019; Blodgett et al., 2020), (ii) inter-annotator inconsistency may lead to unreliable judgments (Sap et al., 2022; Mendelsohn and Budak, 2025), (iii) ambiguity in standard scalar ratings may introduce arbitrary granularities (Schuman and Presser, 1996; Schwarz, 1999), and (iv) distributional skew limits exposure to diverse attribute configurations (Paullada et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2023). Our proposed counterfactual attribute synthesis addresses all these challenges via controlled approach that replaces absolute scalar ratings with generative approach that systematically isolates attribute dimensions, while preserving semantic consistency. 3 Figure 3 Attribute predictor training pipeline. strong LM generator (Llama 3 405B) creates counterfactual variations of original content across attribute levels, generating paired training data where responses differ only along the target attribute dimension. The resulting data pairs enable contrastive attribute distillation, the training of small, specialized attribute predictors (Llama 3 1B) to distinguish attribute intensities. Formally, let s(y) represent the attribute-independent semantic content of response y. For an attribute and an intensity level L, we can generate counterfactual ya,l for that particular attribute level that preserves the original core semantic message: s(ya,l) s(y), Aa(ya,l) l, and Ak(ya,l) Ak(y) = i. Here, Aa(y) represents the intensity level of attribute in response (e.g., extreme formality), and Ak(y) represents the intensity level of any other attribute = in y. This isolates attribute effects while preserving semantic content, which, in practice, is nearly impossible to find in naturally occurring text. By explicitly controlling for confounding variables and enabling systematic coverage of the full attribute spaceincluding rare attributes underrepresented in common interactionsour approach establishes the ground truth through the generation process itself. For any counterfactual response pair (ya,l1 , ya,l2 ) where l1 < l2, note that ya,l2 , establishing scalable learning signal along the target attribute dimension. Our novel generative approach ensures that the pairwise differences only exist along the target attribute dimension. This synthetic data generation is efficient and cheap to scale without human annotations of attribute scores. exhibits higher level of attribute than ya,l1 Contrastive Attribute Distillation Using the counterfactual pairs generated by larger teacher model that possesses richer attribute understanding capabilities, we can establish contrastive knowledge distillation framework to train specialized, smaller attribute predictors. We distill to smaller specialized predictors for computational efficiency at inference time. For each attribute dimension a, the attribute function is Aa(y) = Sigmoid(ra(y)), where ra is reward model that outputs real-valued score and is trained on the counterfactual pairs using the following objective: Lattr = log œÉ(ra(ya,l2) ra(ya,l1 )). As Figure 3 shows, this approach enables the efficient distillation of nuanced attribute understanding from more powerful generative model to smaller attribute predictor, resulting in set of specialized models that can extract latent attributes from any response y. Overall, the attribute representation learning component provides scalable pipeline for extracting latent attributes that can be easily integrated into preference modeling pipelines."

            "content": "The second stage of PrefPalette operationalizes the attribute-mediated decision process by integrating latent attributes into preference modeling. The main goal of this component is to learn context-aware importance weightings, Œ±. The weighted attribute representation is augmented with the semantic representation via an aggregate function, , to compute final preference prediction. Given an instruction and response y, we model the preference function Œ®(x, y) as Œ®(x, y) = (x, y, {Aa(y)}n a=1), 4 i=1 where {Ai(y)}n represents the set of latent attribute representations computed by our specialized attribute predictors. We implement the aggregate function within Transformer-based architecture where the instruction and response are jointly encoded, and attribute dimensions are passed through self-attention mechanism that captures the context-specific importance of attributes. Our approach incorporates the attributes in latent space rather than using them as explicit prediction targets for the preference model. Attention-Based Attribute Integration We employ attention-based integration at the last hidden state of the last token: hintegrated = h(x,y) + Attn({hAa }n a=1), where h(x,y) represents the content encoding and hAa represents the attribute predictor hidden states. Unlike other two-stage preference prediction approaches (e.g., Wang et al., 2024a,b), PrefPalette uses attributes as supervision through the hidden representations of trained attribute predictors rather than explicit attribute scores. This design choice better matches the latent role of attributes in human cognitive decision-making processes, where attribute influences are implicit rather than explicitly computed. The attention mechanism, Attn(), computes importance weights Œ± Rn for all attribute dimensions through parameterized function Œ±i = , where ei = fattn(hAi, h(x,y)). (cid:80)n exp(ei) k=1 exp(ek) Using the importance weights Œ±, we then compute the weighted sum of the attribute hidden states to obtain the final attribute representation.1 This formulation allows the model to adaptively prioritize different attributes in different contexts, similar to how humans may selectively weight attribute dimensions when evaluating different scenarios, and offers inherent interpretability of the predictive importance of each attribute. Gradual Feature Reduction The PrefPalette framework leverages the learned attribute representations at training time to guide preference modeling. PrefPalette eliminates the need for attribute predictors at inference time to enhance model generality and efficiency. To this end, we employ gradual feature reduction during training by stochastically masking attribute information with probability term Œª that iteratively increases as training progresses: hintegrated = h(x,y) + Œ≤ Attn({hAi}n i=1), Œ≤ Bernoulli(1 Œª), Gradual feature reduction encourages the preference model to internalize attribute-related patterns within its parameters, therefore enabling attribute-informed preference prediction even when explicit attribute signals are unavailable during deployment, while maintaining computational efficiency."

We use subset of Reddit data collected from Pushshift.io in January 2023 (Baumgartner et al., 2020), which consists of 680 online communities, or subreddits, characterized by high user activity and diverse community norms.2 Following preprocessing protocols established in prior work (Park et al., 2024a), we sample up to 100,000 preference pairs per domain. We use all domains to train universal attribute predictors, and randomly sample 45 domains for evaluation (Appendix B). Attribute Selection Our attribute taxonomy encompasses 19 dimensions across sociolinguistic norms, and cultural values, two conceptual categories grounded in multi-attribute decision making. Sociolinguistic norms encompass stylistic dimensions that shape communicative effectiveness (Formality, Verbosity, Directness, Assertiveness) and interpersonal qualities that govern social acceptability (Supportiveness, Politeness, Sarcasm, Humor, Empathy). We also model cultural values grounded in Schwartzs theory of basic values (Schwartz, 2012), which identifies ten fundamental cross-cultural motivational goals: Self-Direction, Stimulation, Hedonism, Achievement, Power, Security, Conformity, Tradition, Benevolence, Universalism.3 1See Appendix for complete architectural details and choices of fattn. 2This is the last publicly available licensed Reddit dataset. 3Appendix provides further universal attribute predictor evaluation details. 5 While other attributes can be adapted to different domains, this particular attribute set captures both surfacelevel linguistic features and the deeper normative dimensions that are linked to preference formation (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981; Fischer et al., 1999). Importantly, note that PrefPalette remains attribute-agnostic: it provides generalizable framework for attribute-mediated preference modeling that is independent of the specific dimensions involved."

We first observe that PrefPalette meaningfully improves preference modeling compared to four baselines: GPT-4o-as-a-judge (Kumar et al., 2024; OpenAI et al., 2024), Dialog-RPT (Gao et al., 2020), ValueScope (Park et al., 2024a), and Direct Attribute Augmentation (PrefPalette-Score) across variety of domains. II. Mechanism Analysis. We examine the internal dynamics of PrefPalette by analyzing (i) attribute attention weights that reveal which dimensions most strongly influence preferences in different social contexts; (ii) attribute categories (linguistic norms, social norms, cultural values) that quantify their relative contribution to prediction accuracy; and (iii) integration strategies that determine the effect of attribute weights on end-task predictive performance. III. Robustness and Generalization. We evaluate the robustness of PrefPalette through temporally-shifted test sets on different domains, and show that attribute-mediated preference modeling exhibits stronger distributional robustness than baseline approaches.

These examples reveal how PrefPalettes attribute-mediated approach enables context-sensitive preference prediction. In r/humor, PrefPalette correctly prioritizes humor and sarcasm attributes, selecting the playful Gangus Kahn wordplay over the dismissive critique. Notably, Stimulation consistently appears as top-weighted attribute across domains, suggesting that PrefPalette has learned that intellectually engaging content drives preferences regardless of context. In r/confession, the model appropriately emphasizes empathy and supportiveness, choosing the understanding response about denture theft over the judgmental rub it in comment. This demonstrates PrefPalettes ability to adapt its evaluative framework to community norms prioritizing entertainment value in humor contexts while emphasizing emotional support in confession spaces. These attribute scores provide direct insight into the models reasoning: rather than treating preferences as black box, PrefPalette reveals that its correct predictions stem from weighting community-appropriate dimensions. PrefPalette may fail when community preferences depend on domain-specific semantic dimensions beyond the 19 value attributes, such as technical accuracy or factual correctness. The attention mechanism could also over-rely on spurious attribute correlations from training data that fail to generalize to new content patterns. However, ValueScopes failures in these cases highlight the limitation of approaches that lack explicit attribute decomposition; they cannot adaptively emphasize the social and linguistic dimensions that actually drive human preference formation in different contexts."

            "content": "Personalized preference modeling. In recent years, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the de facto paradigm for aligning pre-trained language models with human values, typically via secondary post-training stage on preference data (Bai et al., 2022; Casper et al., 2023). However, existing preference datasetsthe resulting models trained on themoften fail to reflect how human stakeholders actually generate preferences in real-world settings (Knox et al., 2023; Hatgis-Kessell et al., 2025). While most preference data typically characterizes aggregate preferences across large-scale human population, an emergent thread of work focuses on capturing personalized preferences, which involves customizing model outputs to the criteria of individual users or perspectives (Jang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025b; Singh et al., 2025). For example, Jang et al. (2024) factorize preferences into multiple dimensions (e.g., expertise, informativeness, style) and introduce post-hoc parameter merging method of dimension policy models to provide personalized alignment. Poddar et al. (2024) employ variational preference learning to learn reward model that covers diverse user preferences. Both works use small-scale, synthetic evaluation sets. In contrast, PrefPalette evaluates on domains harvested from real-world interactions. Li et al. (2025b) capture personalized user 9 preferences by using small user model to learn individual user preferences. Additionally, Singh et al. (2025) re-frame personalization as meta-learning problem, in which the individual users preferences is inferred at inference time via few-shot preference examples. PrefPalette operates at higher level of granularity and transparency, modeling preferences via latent value attribute decomposition at the level of social communities rather than individuals. Learning from community norms. Naturally occurring interactions from online communities or forums form suitable testbed for studying the collective preferences shared by users who implicitly adhere to similar value systems. In holistic study on subreddits (Reddit communities), Park et al. (2024b) find that even communities that may appear thematically similar on surface level may hold different social normative structures. Kumar et al. (2024) propose ComPOa modification to DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024), in which the probability distribution of model outputs is additionally conditioned on the users community (as proxy for the users individual preferences). PrefPalette differs by explicitly modeling cognitive attribute structures and demonstrating superior prediction and robustness through interpretable value decomposition. As the first approach to modeling community-level preferences by factorizing them into interpretable dimensions, our contribution offers birds-eye view of shared evaluative normsenabling interpretable, context-sensitive generalization across users who implicitly adhere to similar value systems."

            "title": "7 Conclusion and Future Work\nWe present PrefPalette, incorporating cognitive attribute structures into preference modeling. By condi-\ntioning on attributes in latent space and using weighted representations, PrefPalette achieves superior\naccuracy while enabling interpretable preference analysis across social contexts. While our choice of dataset is\nlarge, realistic, diverse, and facilitates a controlled analysis, it may nevertheless blunt the generalizability of\nour findings to user dynamics beyond this scope (i.e., other online platforms or non-English speakers).",
            "content": "Conditioning on the 19 attributes we use in this work, which capture sociolinguistic norms and cultural values, also improves the preference models robustness to distribution shifts over time, potentially reducing the need to re-train new preference models. While our choice of attributes is comprehensive, it is by no means exhaustive. How our findings could extend to other implicit attributes (particularly those that are low-resourced or yield sparse preference signals) remains an open question. The latent attribute dimensions learned by PrefPalette are not directly validated via human annotations. While these dimensions are interpretable post hoc and advance our understanding of preference patterns among distinct social communities, we believe that incorporating human-in-the-loop evaluation or cognitive studiesin addition to our existing qualitative case studieswould further enrich our insights. We believe there is rich interface between computational preference modeling and cognitive theories of preference formation. PrefPalette is first attempt at exploring this interface, and the further incorporation of cognitive theories into preference modeling approaches is an exciting direction for future work."

            "title": "Ethics Statement",
            "content": "We identify several potential risks to our work. To begin, PrefPalette is able to more accurately model the latent value attributes of human users. However, this same capability may also raise the likelihood of illuminating undesirable viewpoints (e.g., stereotypical beliefs or toxicity), and could contribute to the formation of echo chambers, reinforce ideological silos, or amplify misinformation and polarization (Cinelli et al., 2021). Such risks are especially salient in environments where social feedback signals (e.g., upvotes) are moreso an indicator of localized popularity instead of normative desirability. To minimize such risks, post-hoc safeguards (Inan et al., 2023) could be applied to filter only for particular preferences or values that are flagged as socially helpful. Another consequence arises from the fine-grained, personalized alignment provided by PrefPalette. Better preference modeling benefits user-centric applications, but it can also be misused as an apparatus to influence or manipulate user behavior in sensitive domains (i.e., political messaging, targeted advertising). While core benefit of PrefPalette is its transparency, we must caution that the interpretability of 10 latent attributes does not guarantee their correctness or universality. Human preferences are by nature fluid, contextual, and subjective (Tversky and Simonson, 1993); there is possibility that practitioners may over-interpret the learned attributes as objective truths rather than model-inferred approximations from data with underlying biases. Ultimately, striking balance between the precise modeling of human preferences and the development of fair and inclusive systems remains critical direction for future work. Still, we believe that PrefPalette contributes to broader praxis of value-aligned AI design, bridging theoretical grounding from cognitive science to the practice of preference modeling."

            "content": "This section outlines the key components of our attribute-mediated preference model. We use LLaMA 3.2 (1B parameters) (Touvron et al., 2023) as the base model to train the predictor models, with the attribute integration mechanism as our primary novel contribution. Representation Extraction. Given an instruction-response pair (x, y), the model processes the tokenized concatenation through the Transformer encoder to obtain the hidden representation hfinal Rd (where = 3200) from the final token position. Attribute Integration Mechanism. The core innovation of our approach is the dynamic integration of attribute information with content representation. For attribute predictors yielding the set of hidden states {hAi }n , we compute attention weights as i=1 Œ±i = exp(ei) k=1 exp(ek) (cid:80)n , where ei = 3 tanh(W1hAi + W2h(x,y) + b1) + b2. (1) Here, W1 Rdd and W2 Rdd are learned projection matrices, b1 Rd and b2 are bias terms, and w3 Rd is learned weight vector that maps the combined representation to scalar attention score. This attention mechanism enables context-specific weighting of attribute dimensions, capturing the dynamic nature of attribute-mediated evaluation. The aggregated attribute representation is computed as: hattr = (cid:88) i=1 Œ±ihAi. (2) We then combine the attribute representation hattr with the content representation. The learnable parameter Œ≥ (initialized to 0.5) controls the relative contribution of attribute information versus content representation in the integrated hidden state: hintegrated = hfinal + Œ≥hattr. (3) Preference Learning. The final preference score is computed as (x, y) = we employ standard pairwise ranking loss: hintegrated + bp. For training, Lpref = log œÉ(P (x, ypreferred) (x, yrejected)). (4) Feature Reduction Strategy. To enable inference without attribute signals, we implement progressive attribute dropout strategy during training. The dropout probability, pdropout(t), increases linearly with the number of training steps and is capped at 0.8. It is denoted as pdropout(t) = min(0.8, 0.75 ), where is the current number of training steps and is the total number of training steps. When dropout is applied, the model must rely solely on the content representation: (cid:40) hintegrated = hfinal + Œªhattr with probability 1 pdropout(t), hfinal with probability pdropout(t). (5) (6) Optimization. We train using an AdamW optimizer with learning rate of 1 105, batch size of 128, and weight decay set to 0.01 for 100,000 steps with cosine learning rate decay and linear warmup. 15 Attribute Importance Analysis. To interpret the models attribute utilization patterns, we analyze the attention weights across domains. For domain Dk, the mean importance of attribute is: = 1 Dk (cid:88) Œ±i(x, y). (x,y)Dk (7) This quantitative analysis reveals which attributes most influence preference predictions in different social contexts, providing interpretable insights into the attribute-mediated evaluation process."

To prepare source data for each attribute in the attribute representation learning module, we randomly sample 100 comments from each subreddit and generate counterfactual comments along 5 Likert scale levels, resulting in 680 100 5 = 340K synthetic comments, which allows us to form 680 100 (cid:0)5 (cid:1) = 680K attribute-specific pairs.

Supportiveness Level Counterfactual Comment 1 3 4 5 are kidding me, everyone knows this is \"joke\" but honestly who needs comedy when this is just depressing reality, and dont even get me started on how NO ONE talks about this super obvious symptom like its not even real issue, get ur priorities straight people, this isnt something to be laughed at \"come on, we all know this is joke, but seriously, why doesnt anyone talk about this symptom? its actually kinda big deal and its wild that it gets swept under the rug so often.\" this is actually common thing that happens. its not often discussed, but it can be an issue. same lol but yeah its wild how often this gets swept under the rug, def needs more attention imo, glad someones bringing it up omg im so glad you brought this up!! know the post is meant to be funny but honestly, its SO relatable and im really grateful youre talking about it bc this symptom is way more common than people think and it can be super tough to deal with Table 4 Examples of text with varying levels of supportiveness (1 = least supportive, 5 = most supportive)"

            "content": "We evaluate our universal attribute predictors on held-out test sets of counterfactual comment and post pairs to verify their ability to distinguish between different attribute intensity levels. The high accuracy scores across all 19 attributes (ranging from 98.4% to 100%) in Table 5 demonstrate that our contrastive attribute distillation approach successfully transfers attribute understanding from the strong teacher model to the smaller specialized predictors. These results validate that the attribute predictors can reliably extract latent attribute information from text, providing solid foundation for the attribute-mediated preference modeling framework. 16 Attribute Supportiveness Politeness Sarcasm Humor Formality Verbosity Directness Assertiveness Empathy Self-Direction Stimulation Hedonism Achievement Power Security Conformity Tradition Benevolence Universalism Comment Acc.

            "content": "We conduct human evaluation studies to validate whether PrefPalettes attention weights accurately reflect attribute-preference relationships. Using r/AskHistorians as case study, we test whether high-importance attributes (Verbosity and Stimulation) show stronger correlations with preference scores than low-importance attributes (Security and Power), as identified from Table 2. For Stimulation, Security, and Power, four trained annotators evaluated 100 comment pairs per attribute on 5-point comparative scale, with majority-voted ratings used for correlation analysis. For Verbosity, we used character count as an objective proxy and additionally analyzed r/HighQualityGifs where verbosity has low importance. Table 6 presents correlation results between attribute ratings and preference scores. High-importance attributes show positive correlations while low-importance attributes show near-zero or negative correlations, confirming PrefPalettes predictions. The modest magnitudes reflect preference formations multi-factorial nature. These results validate that PrefPalettes attention weights capture meaningful attribute-preference relationships.
