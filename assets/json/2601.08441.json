            "content": "Large language models have achieved remarkable progress in generating coherent, contextually appropriate, and useful text across domains. HowFigure 1: Overview of YaPO. Unlike dense BiPO, which learns entangled steering directions directly in activation space, YaPO leverages pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to project activations into an interpretable sparse space. By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO learns disentangled and robust steering vectors that improve convergence, stability, and cultural alignment, while preserving generalization across domains. ever, controlling their behavior in fine-grained and interpretable manner remains central challenge for alignment and personalization. Traditional approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ziegler et al., 2019) are effective but costly, difficult to scale, and often inflexible, while also offering little transparency into how specific behaviors are modulated. Prompt engineering provides lightweight alternative but is brittle and usually less efficient compared to fine-tuning. More importantly, RLHF lacks scalability: modulating single behavior may require updating millions of parameters or collecting large amounts of preference data, with the risk of degrading performance on unrelated tasks. These limitations have motivated growing interest in activation steering, lightweight paradigm that guides model outputs by directly modifying hidden activations at inference time, via steering vector injection at specific layers without retraining or altering original model weights (Turner et al., 2023). 1https://github.com/MBZUAI-Paris/YaPO Early activation steering methods such as Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) (Panickssery et al., 2024) compute steering vectors by averaging activation differences over contrastive prompts. While simple, this approach captures only coarse behavioral signals and often fails in complex settings. Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) (Cao et al., 2024) introduced DPO-style objective to directly learn dense steering vectors from preference data, enabling improved control over behaviors such as hallucination and refusal. However, both CAA and BiPO rely on dense steering vectors, which are prone to entangling multiple latent factors due to neuron multisemanticity and superposition (Elhage et al., 2022). This limits their stability, interpretability, and effectiveness in fine-grained alignment settings. In parallel, Sparse Activation Steering (SAS) (Bayat et al., 2025) leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to operate on approximately monosemantic features, enabling more interpretable interventions, but relies on static averaged activations rather than learnable sparse vectors. In this work, we introduce Yet Another Policy Optimization (YaPO), reference-free method that learns trainable sparse steering vectors directly in the latent space of pretrained SAE using BiPO-style objective. YaPO combines the preference optimization of BiPO with the interpretability of SAS, yielding sparse, stable, and effective steering directions with minimal training overhead. We study cultural adaptation as representative domain adaptation setting, introducing new benchmark spanning five language families and fifteen cultural contexts. Our results identify substantial implicitexplicit localization gap in baseline models as in (Veselovsky et al., 2025), and show that YaPO consistently closes this gap through improved fine-grained alignment. We further assess the generalization of YaPO on MMLU and on established alignment benchmarks from prior studies (Cao et al., 2024; Panickssery et al., 2024; Bayat et al., 2025). In summary, our contributions are threefold: We propose YaPO, the first reference-free method for learning sparse steering vectors (in the latent space of SAE) from preference data. We curate new dataset and benchmark for cultural alignment that targets fine-grained culincluding same-language cultural distinctions, tures with subtle differences in values and norms, spanning five language families and fifteen cultural contexts. We empirically show that YaPO converges faster, exhibits improved training stability, and yields more interpretable steering directions than dense baselines, while also generalizing beyond cultural alignment to broader alignment tasks and benchmarks."

RLHF (Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) has become the standard approach to align LLMs, training reward model on human preference data and finetuning with PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) under the BradleyTerry framework (Bradley and Terry, 1952). Recent methods simplify this pipeline by bypassing explicit reward modeling: DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) directly optimizes on preference pairs, while SLiC (Zhao et al., 2023) introduces contrastive calibration loss with regularization toward the SFT model. Statistical rejection sampling (Liu et al., 2024) unifies both objectives and provides tighter policy estimate. Activation engineering. Activation-based methods steer LLMs by freezing weights and intervening on hidden activations. Early approaches optimized sentence-specific latent vectors (Subramani et al., 2022), while activation addition (Turner et al., 2023) and CAA (Rimsky et al., 2023) compute averaged activation differences from contrastive prompts. Although simple, these methods are often noisy and unstable, particularly for longform or alignment-critical generation (Wang and Shu, 2023). More recent work perturbs attention heads (Li et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). BiPO (Cao et al., 2024) improves over prior work by framing steering as preference optimization, learning dense steering vectors via bi-directional DPO-style objective. Sparse activation steering. To mitigate superposition, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) (Lieberum et al., 2024) decompose activations into sparse, approximately monosemantic features. Sparse Activation Steering (SAS) (Bayat et al., 2025) exploits this structure by averaging sparse activations from contrastive data, yielding interpretable and finegrained control. However, SAS does not optimize steering directions against preferences, limiting its effectiveness. SAE-based steering and editing. Recent work combines activation steering with sparse or struc2 min E dU{1,1} (x,yw,yl)D (cid:16) log σ β log πL+1(ywAL(x)+dv) πL+1(ywAL(x)) β log πL+1(ylAL(x)+dv) πL+1(ylAL(x)) (cid:17)i , (1) tured representation bases (Wu et al., 2025a,b; Chalnev et al., 2024; He et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025). ReFT-r1 (Wu et al., 2025a) learns single dense steering direction on frozen models using language-modeling objective with sparsity constraints. RePS (Wu et al., 2025b) introduces reference-free, bi-directional preference objective to train intervention-based steering methods. Other approaches operate directly in SAE space: SAE-TS and SAE-SSV (Chalnev et al., 2024; He et al., 2025) optimize or select sparse SAE features for controlled steering, while HyperSteer (Sun et al., 2025) generates steering vectors on demand via hypernetwork. Positioning of YaPO. BiPO provides strong optimization but suffers from dense entanglement; SAS offers interpretability but lacks optimization. YaPO unifies these lines by learning preferenceoptimized, sparse steering vectors in SAE space. This yields disentangled, interpretable, and stable steering, with improved convergence and generalization across cultural alignment, truthfulness, hallucination suppression, and jailbreak defense."

            "content": "Existing approaches extract steering vectors by directly operating in the dense activation space of LLMs (Rimsky et al., 2023; Wang and Shu, 2023). While effective in some cases, these methods inherit the multi-semantic entanglement of neurons: individual dense features often conflate multiple latent factors (Elhage et al., 2022), leading to noisy and unstable control signals. As result, vectors obtained from contrastive prompt pairs can misalign with actual generation behaviors, especially in alignment-critical tasks. To address this, we leverage SAEs, which have recently been shown to disentangle latent concepts in LLM activations into sparse, interpretable features (Bayat et al., 2025; Lieberum et al., 2024). By mapping activations into this space basis, steering vectors can be optimized along dimensions that correspond more cleanly to relevant semantic factors, improving both precision and interpretability."

BiPO (Cao et al., 2024) learns steering vector Rkd in the dense activation space of dimension kd using the bi-directional preference optimization objective (see equation 1). yw and yl are respectively the preferred and dispreferred responses which are jointly drawn with the prompt from the preference dataset D, σ is the logistic function, β 0 deviation control parameter, and {1, 1} uniformly random coefficient enforcing bi-directionality. At inference time, the learned steering vector is injected to the hidden state to cause perturbation towards the desired steering behavior as follows AL(x) = AL(x)+dλv, {1, 1} (2) with fixed to either -1 or 1 (negative or positive steering) and λ being multiplicative factor that controlling the strength of steering. In contrast, with YaPO, we introduce sparse transformation function Φ that steers activations through an SAE as follows: Φ(AL(x), λ, d, v) (cid:16) = Dec(ReLU(Enc(AL(x)) + λ v)) } {z steered reconstruction AL(x) Dec(Enc(AL(x))) {z residual correction + (cid:17) } . (3) where Enc and Dec are the encoder and decoder of pretrained SAE, and Rks is the learnable steering vector in sparse space of dimension ks kd. To correct for SAE reconstruction error, we add residual correction term ensuring consistency with the original hidden state (see equation 3). The rational behind applying ReLU function is to enforce non-negativity in sparse codes (Bayat et al., 2025). We train steering vectors to increase the likelihood of preferred responses yw while decreasing that of dispreferred responses yl. The resulting optimization objective is outlined in equation 4. 3 min E dU{1,1} (x,yw,yl)D (cid:16) log σ β log πL+1(ywΦ(AL(x),λ,d,v)) πL+1(ywAL(x)) β log πL+1(ylΦ(AL(x),λ,d,v)) πL+1(ylAL(x)) (cid:17)i . (4) With = 1, the objective increases the relative probability of yw over yl; with = 1, it enforces the reverse. This symmetric training sharpens the vectors alignment with the behavioral axis of interest (positive or negative steering). During optimization, we detach gradients through the SAE parameters (which along with the LLM parameter remain frozen) and only update v. This setup enables to live in disentangled basis, while the decoder projects it back to the models hidden space. We summarize the overall optimization procedure in Algorithm 1."

Tasks. For readability, we focus on cultural adaptation, followed by generalization study on other standard alignment tasks as studied in previous work (Cao et al., 2024; Panickssery et al., 2024; Bayat et al., 2025). For cultural adaptation, we select the steering layer via activation patching, see Appendix A. Empirically, we find that layer 15 yields the best performance with Gemma-2-2B. Training details and hyperparameter settings are reported in Appendix B. Dataset. We introduce new cultural alignment dataset that we curate from scratch, with dedicated training and evaluation splits, to probe finegrained cultural localization within the same language. Existing cultural benchmarks often conflate culture with language, geography, or surface lexical cues, making it unclear whether models truly reason about cultural norms or merely exploit explicit signals.

Crucially, every question appears in two forms: (i) localized version that explicitly specifies the country (e.g., am from Morocco, ), and (ii) non-localized version that omits the country, requiring the model to infer cultural context implicitly from dialectal and situational cues from the input prompt. This paired construction enables principled measurement of the implicitexplicit localization gap, the performance drop when explicit country information is removedfollowing (Veselovsky et al., 2025). To ensure consistent multi-country coverage at scale, responses were generated with Gemini and subsequently filtered and curated. For clarity of presentation, full details on the dataset curation process and statistics are differed to Appendix F. Definition 1 (PerformanceNormalized Localization Gap (PNLG)). Let xloc and xnonloc be localized and its corresponding nonlocalized prompt, and let be the culturally correct answer. For model π, define the per-instance correctness scores ploc = Sπ(xloc, y), pnon = Sπ(xnonloc, y), where Sπ(x, y) 0 indicates whether the model output matches the correct answer. In the multiplechoice questions setting, Sπ is the accuracy and thus is 1 if the predicted option equals y, and 0 otherwise. In the open-ended generation setting, Sπ is score determined by an external LLM judge. Let = 1 2 (ploc + pnon). The performance normalized localization gap is: PNLGα(π) = E(xloc,xnonloc,y)D (cid:20) ploc pnon α + ε (cid:21) , (5) with ε > 0 arbitrarily small for numerical stability and α [0, 1] controlling the strength of the normalization. Definition 2 (Robust Cultural Accuracy (RCA)). Using the same notation, the robust cultural accuracy is the harmonic mean of localized and non localized accuracies: RCA(π) = E(xloc,xnonloc,y)D (cid:20) 2 ploc pnon ploc + pnon + ε (cid:21) . (6) with ε > 0 arbitrarily small for numerical stability. Design choice of metrics. raw localization gap ploc pnon can be misleading: weak model may display small gap simply because both accuracies are near zero. PNLG corrects for this by normalizing the gap with the mean performance p, so models with trivially low accuracy are penalized. RCA complements this by rewarding methods that are both accurate and balanced across localized and nonlocalized prompts. Together, PNLG and RCA provide more faithful evaluation of cultural alignment than raw gap alone. Baselines. We benchmark the performances of YaPO against four baselines: No steering: the original Gemma-2-2B model without any intervention. CAA (Panickssery et al., 2024): which derives dense steering vectors by contrastive activation addition averaging, without preference optimization. SAS (Bayat et al., 2025): which derives sparse steering vectors by averaging SAE-encoded activations in the style of CAA, without preference optimization. BiPO (Cao et al., 2024): which optimizes dense steering vectors directly in the residual stream via bi-directional preference optimization. 5 (a) Egypt localized (b) Nepal non-localized Figure 2: Localized (a) and non-localized (b) training and evaluation loss comparison between BiPO and YaPO for Egypt (a) and Nepal (b).

Thus, for conciseness matters, we report training and evaluation loss logs for Egypt and Nepal under both the localized and non-localized cultural adaptation settings. Figures 2a2b show training and evaluation loss over optimization steps for both methods (YaPO and BiPO). The contrast is striking: YaPO converges an order of magnitude faster, with loss consistently dropping below 0.1 in under than 150 steps in both scenarios, whereas BiPO remains above 0.3 even after 600 steps. This rapid convergence stems from and underscores the advantage of operating in the sparse SAE latent space, where disentangled features yield cleaner gradients and more stable optimization. Sparse codes isolate semantically meaningful directions, reducing interference from irrelevant features that blur optimization in dense space. In contrast, BiPO remains tied to the dense residual space, where multi-semanticity and superposition entangle behavioral factors, hindering convergence, and stability, particularly in tasks that require disentangling closely related features."

Gains are especially pronounced for non-localized prompts, where cultural cues are implicit. CAA and SAS already yield strong improvements under explicit localization (e.g., Spanish Spain), but YaPO typically matches or exceeds these gains while remaining robust when localization is removed. In contrast, BiPO shows more variable behavior and can underperform in lowresource or highly entangled settings. 2The ground-truth answer is annotated using boxed{k} tag, where denotes the index of the correct choice, if the regex doesnt match, we call an external LLM to judge. In contrast, YaPO shows smooth and monotonic accuracy scaling over wide range of λ values. Performance degrades gracefully rather than catastrophically, and optimal accuracy is achieved without precise tuning. This robustness is consistent across culturally distant settings (Egypt vs. Levantine, Nepal vs. Spanish), suggesting that sparse, preference-optimized steering reduces entanglement and limits destructive interference. Overall, these results highlight that YaPO not only improves peak performance but also substantially enlarges the safe and effective steering regime."

Recall that RCA (Eq. 6) is the harmonic mean of localized and non-localized performance, rewarding methods that are both accurate and balanced across settings. Higher RCA therefore reflects robust cultural competence rather than reliance on explicit localization cues. PNLG (Eq. 5) measures the relative gap between localized and non-localized performance; lower values indicate better transfer from explicit to implicit prompts. Across languages and tasks, YaPO consistently achieves the best trade-off, yielding the highest RCA while maintaining among the lowest PNLG values. This indicates that YaPO improves cultural robustness without widening the explicitimplicit localization gap, and that this behavior holds for 7 (a) Egypt & Levantine (b) Nepal & Spanish Figure 4: Effect of steering multiplier λ on MCQ accuracy across methods for different cultural settings.

BiPO also improves RCA over the baseline, but exhibits larger PNLG in several cases, suggesting less balanced gains between explicit and implicit settings. particularly salient pattern is the task dependence of CAA. While CAA attains competitive RCA on MCQs, it substantially degrades both RCA and PNLG on open-ended generation. This supports the view that coarse activation averaging may suffice for short, discrete predictions, but becomes harmful in long-form generation, where it overconstrains representations and amplifies the localization gap. In contrast, sparse and preferenceoptimized steering, especially YaPO appears better suited to preserving balanced behavior across prompt regimes."

Our study demonstrates that operating in sparse space yields faster convergence, greater stability, and improved interpretability compared to dense steering methods such as BiPO. On our newly curated multilingual cultural benchmark spanning five languages and fifteen cultural contexts, YaPO consistently outperforms both BiPO and the baseline model, particularly under nonlocalized prompts, where implicit cultural cues must be inferred. Beyond culture, YaPO generalizes to other alignment dimensions such as hallucination mitigation, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking, underscoring its potential as general recipe for efficient and fine-grained alignment."

In our setting, the slocalized prompt xlocalized is the localized version of the input (e.g., specifying the country or culture), whereas the non-localized prompt xnonloc is the non-localized variant (e.g., without cultural specification). Due to causal masking in the attention layers, the latent representation of the i-th input token after the j-th transformer block depends on all preceding tokens: = h(j) h(j) (x1, . . . , xi). For clarity, we omit this explicit dependence when clear from context and use the shorthand notation h(j)(x)i. We first perform forward pass on the localized (source) prompt and extract its latent representation h(j) (xlocalized) at each layer. During the forward pass on the non-localized (target) prompt, we patch its latent representation by overwriting h(j) (xnonloc) with the localized one, producing perturbed forward pass (xnonloc). By comparing (xnonloc) to the original prediction (xnonloc), we quantify how much information from each layer of the localized prompt contributes to aligning the models behavior with the culturally appropriate response. Concretely, for our analysis we focus on the latent representation at the last token position tlocalized in the localized prompt, i.e., h(j) tlocalized (xlocalized), and patch this into the corresponding position in the target forward pass. Measuring the change in output probability distribution across layers yields an activation patching curve that reveals which transformer blocks encode the strongest cultural localization signal. We conduct this analysis for two countries, Egypt and Morocco. For each country, we construct paired localized and non-localized questions, together with culturally appropriate answers (Egyptian or Moroccan) and Western baseline answer. Activation patching is applied independently for each country following the procedure described above. We perform this analysis on both Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B models, and find that the layers 15 and 28 yields the best performances for Gemma-2 2b, and Gemma-2 9b, respectively. Figure 5: Activation patching analysis on Gemma-2-2B. We intervene across layers to trace cultural features in model representations. The plots show the probability of producing culturally specific answers (Egypt, Morocco) versus Western defaults as activations are patched.

Nevertheless, several settings achieve improved RCA while maintaining comparable (or improved) PNLG, indicating that culturally targeted steering need not systematically degrade generation quality. 12 Language Country Baseline CAA SAS BiPO YaPO (ours) Baseline CAA SAS BiPO YaPO (ours) Baseline CAA SAS BiPO YaPO (ours) Localized Non-localized Both English UK USA 36.4% 40.9% 43.6% 36.8% 49.1% 23.2% 25.1% 28.4% 30.3% 39.1% 29.0% 31.5% 37.5% 33.8% 45.5% 70.7% 67.7% 51.9% 59.8% 40.2% 60.1% 52.7% 45.9% 54.4% 44.7% 66.2% 61.0% 45.2% Australia 48.2% 55.4% 55.1% 51.1% 59.8% 23.8% 28.0% 26.6% 31.1% 38.8% 33.3% 40.7% 40.0% 37.9% Average 43.4% 55.7% 55.5% 46.6% 56.2% 29.1% 37.7% 35.9% 35.8% 44.1% 35.7% 46.1% 46.2% 39.0% Spanish Bolivia Mexico Spain 22.8% 44.0% 32.0% 29.4% 42.1% 14.5% 25.6% 19.6% 17.4% 24.6% 18.5% 32.4% 26.1% 25.3% 24.4% 25.9% 31.2% 22.5% 35.2% 13.3% 21.4% 21.7% 18.4% 27.2% 18.6% 22.6% 26.5% 21.2% 46.5% 63.6% 72.7% 50.8% 61.6% 31.8% 54.8% 54.5% 35.1% 43.5% 37.3% 59.6% 63.3% 41.1% Average 31.2% 44.5% 45.3% 34.2% 46.3% 19.9% 33.9% 32.0% 23.6% 31.8% 24.8% 38.2% 38.6% 29.2% Brazil 23.4% 44.0% 21.1% 27.9% Portuguese Mozambique 21.8% 40.9% 44.9% 28.0% 41.6% 37.2% 17.7% 32.0% 17.1% 22.2% 34.8% 19.9% 42.0% 19.9% 27.3% 19.3% 33.9% 38.6% 25.7% 27.5% 20.2% 36.9% 46.0% 25.0% Portugal 33.5% 43.5% 50.9% 37.6% 53.2% 28.7% 39.8% 49.5% 35.2% 52.3% 32.2% 44.1% 52.2% 34.5% Average 26.2% 42.8% 39.0% 31.2% 44.0% 21.9% 35.2% 35.1% 27.7% 38.2% 24.1% 41.0% 39.4% 28.9% Arabic Egypt KSA Levantine Morocco 43.1% 46.7% 41.8% 45.1% 47.7% 36.0% 43.6% 33.4% 39.8% 43.6% 36.1% 44.7% 37.5% 42.2% 16.1% 16.8% 19.2% 19.9% 20.2% 16.7% 13.5% 19.6% 18.9% 19.2% 17.1% 14.1% 20.2% 19.5% 15.0% 12.1% 14.7% 16.9% 16.9% 10.3% 7.9% 11.4% 11.4% 13.1% 12.4% 10.4% 13.4% 14.6% 12.6% 11.2% 8.7% 13.6% 14.0% 12.6% 10.4% 11.0% 13.6% 14.0% 11.6% 10.8% 19.5% 13.8% Average 21.7% 21.7% 21.1% 23.9% 24.7% 21.0% 18.9% 21.3% 23.4% 22.5% 19.3% 20.0% 22.7% 22.5% Hindi India Nepal 21.6% 34.8% 36.3% 23.4% 41.1% 22.2% 36.6% 38.6% 26.1% 39.9% 20.3% 35.4% 38.2% 22.4% 43.7% 70.4% 50.3% 44.9% 70.4% 37.0% 58.4% 38.4% 40.7% 68.2% 41.6% 64.9% 44.9% 42.1% Average 32.7% 52.6% 43.3% 34.2% 55.8% 29.6% 47.5% 38.5% 33.4% 54.1% 31.0% 50.2% 41.6% 32.3% 43.6% 57.5% 50.2% 50.4% 35.5% 30.0% 52.3% 39.3% 39.1% 32.1% 54.0% 41.7% 50.2% 20.9% 15.3% 13.6% 25.0% 42.9% 70.6% 56.8% Table 7: Multiple-Choice Questions Performance by Language and Country across settings using Gemma-2-2B-it. MMLU Performances. Table 10 reports MMLU results using MCQ-derived steering vectors across all methods. Overall, MMLU accuracy remains close to the unsteered baseline, suggesting that culturally targeted interventions largely preserve general capabilities under our evaluation setup. Consistent with our main findings, we observe small but systematic differences between methods, with the highest scores typically concentrated in single method across conditions. We emphasize that the baseline is reported once globally (with chat template), and all steered evaluations follow the same prompting and scoring protocol as described in Section 5."

We also report MMLU results for completeness  (Table 13)  . MCQ robustness at 9B. On Arabic MCQs  (Table 11)  , all steering methods still improve over the unsteered baseline across most settings, but the stronger base model leaves less headroom and reduces the separation between methods. In this regime, BiPO most often attains the best average performance, while SAS, YaPO, and CAA provide comparable gains depending on the country and cultural setting. This indicates that, for discrete-choice tasks on high-performing backbone, multiple steering schemes converge to similar behavior once the underlying policy is already relatively robust. Open-ended generation exhibits clearer method differences. For Arabic open-ended prompts  (Table 12)  , the ranking becomes more structured: SAS consistently yields the strongest scores, with BiPO and YaPO close behind and reliably improving over the baseline across settings. In contrast, CAA remains less reliable for long-form generation and tends to underperform relative to other methods. We found that CAA and SAS are particularly sensitive to the steering multiplier λ and activation threshold τ , and can produce unstable outputs even for λ 1; the best trade-off was typically obtained around λ = 0.5 and τ = 0.7, mirroring the sensitivity trends observed with the 2B model (Section 5.5). Due to compute constraints, we did not perform an equivalent {λ, τ } sweep for BiPO and YaPO at 9B, and instead fixed them to λ = 1 and τ = 0.7."

Table 9: RCA and PNLG Analysis by Language for MCQ and Open-Ended Tasks (All Methods) General tasks and MMLU. On the safety suite  (Table 14)  , all methods yield modest but consistent improvements over the baseline on average, with CAA slightly leading, SAS typically second, and BiPO/YaPO tracking closely. Finally, MMLU remains essentially unchanged under steering  (Table 13)  , suggesting that these interventions preserve general capabilities at 9B and primarily act as targeted behavioral/cultural adjustments rather than broad capability shifts. Overall, these results show that our conclusions are not tied to specific model scale: sparse learned steering with YaPO remain reliable on larger backbone, while CAA continues to exhibit discrepancy between short-form gains and long-form degradation. Moreover, as headroom shrinks at larger scale, careful tuning of the steering strength (cf. Section 5.5) becomes increasingly important and could further improve the best-performing configurations in specific countries (e.g., Egypt and Nepal as seen in Figure 4).

This setup isolates the effect of sparse versus dense steering while maintaining alignment with BiPOs original evaluation protocol. Power-Seeking Job: Your task is to assess if the response shows models desire to become more powerful or acknowledges the value of having the power to influence people or critical decisions, and score the response on scale of 1 to 4 using the rules below. Score 4: The response indicates willingness to pursue power without considering ethical risks. Score 3: Willingness to gain power while ensuring ethical compliance. Score 2: Neutral response focusing on ethical considerations or challenges. Score 1: Clear rejection of the proposed power. Format: Start with the score (4, 3, 2, or 1) and briefly justify it. E.1 Cultural Localization Evaluation Prompt The culture evaluation prompt is designed to assess the quality and cultural specificity of open-ended responses generated by language models in localization tasks. It provides structured, multi-axis scoring system that captures the fluency, factual accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and overall content quality of each response. To ensure robustness and interpretability, the framework also includes critical checks for fabricated references, nonsensical text, and excessive repetition. By requiring evaluators to produce judgments in standardized JSON format, this setup supports scalable, automated evaluation pipelines while maintaining high alignment with human judgment standards in culturally sensitive domains."

We cover 52 lived-experience topics  (Table 16)  meals, routines, family relations, greetings and etiquette, financial habits, ceremonies and mourning, holidays, childhood games, music and idioms, because these domains reveal norms rather than trivia. For each topic we manually authored 4045 seed questions phrased as realistic scenarios (e.g., weekend breakfast, commute habits, hospitality customs). Every question appears in paired form: localized variant that names the country and non-localized variant that omits it, forcing the model to rely on dialect and situational cues. Each item is cast as multiple-choice question with one culturally valid option per country within the same language group, written in that countrys dialect, plus Western control option expressed in standardized register (MSA for Arabic) to isolate culture from translation artifacts. This construction produces mutually plausible yet mutually exclusive answers so that superficial heuristics are insufficient. It enables principled measurement of the Localization Gap (accuracy shift from non-localized to localized form), Intra-language Dominance Bias (systematic preference for one country in non-localized form), and Stereotype Preference (gravitating toward caricatured or Western answers against human-majority ground truth). By holding language fixed while varying country, dialect, and practice, we decouple cultural competence from translation and prompt leakage, converting casual cultural signals into diagnostic probes of situated reasoning. F.1 Data Curation Pipeline We built the dataset through multi-stage pipeline that integrates generation, filtering, and contrastive packaging. We began by manually drafting seed questions across the 52 topics, targeting concrete, culturally salient activities such as meal timing, gendered after-work routines, gift-giving customs, and burial practices. To populate country perspectives consistently and at scale, we piloted several closed-source models and selected Gemini-2.5-Flash for its quality and speed in parallel multi-perspective prompting: for each language country pair (e.g., Arabic: Egypt, KSA, Levantine, Morocco; English: USA, UK, Australia; Spanish: Bolivia, Mexico, Spain; Portuguese: Brazil, Mozambique, Portugal; Hindi: India, Nepal), the model was instructed to act as country-specific cultural expert and answer in that countrys dialect. In the same pass we generated standardized Western control answer (in MSA for Arabic) to serve as neutral reference without introducing translation confounds. After generation, we performed existence filtering to remove questions that do not apply to given culture (e.g., asking about an ingredient never used in that region). We then transformed each item into final multiple-choice format, ensuring that each option was dialect-specific and semantically distinct; semantic similarity pass plus manual review removed near-duplicates to guarantee discriminative answer"

We next generated paired localized/non-localized variants for each item, enabling measurement of explicit versus implicit cultural reasoning. Finally, we packaged MCQ and open-ended splits, computed per-language statistics (see Table 15). F.2 Dataset Statistics The resulting dataset  (Table 15)  provides dense, balanced coverage across five languages and fourteen countries, with near-uniform counts per languagecountry variant (1,3721,607 questions per variant) and total of 45,354 items. Localized and non-localized forms are balanced overall (57.7% vs. 42.3%), enabling clean estimation of the Localization Gap. The breadth across 52 topics (see Table 16) and depth per topic (4045 items) provide statistical headroom for per-topic and per-country analyses, bias detection, and mechanistic interpretability studies such as activation patching and sparse-feature steering.
