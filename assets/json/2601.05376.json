            "content": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being considered for clinical decision-support (Gaber et al., 2025; Fraser et al., 2023; Khatri et al., 2025), desirable model behavior extends beyond pointwise accuracy. Systems must express confi1 dence that is calibrated to reflect uncertainty, maintain consistency between internal preferences and generated recommendations, and adopt an appropriate risk posture for the clinical context. For example, favoring over-triage over under-triage in high-risk cases (Alaa et al., 2025). Ensuring safe, consistent, and steerable behavior is prerequisite for real-world clinical integration (Alaa et al., 2025; Artsi et al., 2025). Yet, current LLMs exhibit misalignment between latent decision signals and surface-level outputs (Wang et al., 2024b; Artsi et al., 2025). This lack of response consistency can lead to inappropriate escalation or missed risk, even when clinical evidence remains unchanged. One widely used intervention for steering LLM behavior is persona conditioning, in which models are contextualized with professional roles or interaction styles (Cintas et al., 2025; Salemi et al., 2024). In clinical settings, such conditioning is often assumed to improve realism, professionalism, or task performance by aligning model outputs with domain-specific norms (Gaber et al., 2025). However, the actual behavioral consequences of persona conditioning, particularly in high-stakes medical decision-making, remain poorly characterized, with limited understanding of when such priors improve performance, when they degrade it, and what safety-relevant trade-offs they introduce. Prior work has explored personas as mechanism for steering LLM behavior, often to elicit diverse or adversarial responses (Deng et al., 2025) or to simulate different user roles (Kyung et al., 2025). In clinical contexts, personas have primarily been used to model patient-side variation, such as demographic or linguistic differences, or to simulate clinician agents for workflow emulation and multi-agent collaboration (Kim et al., 2024b; Kyung et al., 2025; Gaber et al., 2025). These studies show that personas shape model outputs, but they often rest on an implicit assumption: that more expert personas uniformly yield safer Figure 1: Experimental framework for analyzing personas as behavioral priors in clinical LLMs. Personas are injected via system prompts (A). Models are evaluated on two clinical tasks, yielding decision labels, free-text justifications, and latent logit scores (B). Behavioral effects are quantified using automated metrics and assessed qualitatively through blinded LLM-based rankings, with validation by expert clinicians (C). or higher-quality behavior. This assumption remains largely untested in clinical decision-support settings, where inappropriate risk posture or miscalibration has serious consequences. Our findings reveal that persona conditioning produces systematic but non-monotonic effects: medically grounded personas improve emergency-triage performance yet degrade outcomes in primary-care tasks, and interaction styles modulate but do not reliably control risk posture. These results show that personas act as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guaranteed pathways to safer or more expert clinical behavior. Our Contribution. We provide an experimental framework to conduct systematic analysis of medical personas as behavioral priors in clinical LLMs (Figure 1). We evaluate model behavior on triage and patient-safety tasks, examining how professional roles and interaction styles modulate performance, risk posture, and reasoning quality. To operationalize the desirable properties outlined above, we introduce suite of behavioral metrics: consistency rate, risk propensity, risk sensitivity, and calibration. We complement automated metrics with human and LLM-based evaluations to capture broader range of behavioral nuances. Together, these measures enable granular decomposition of how persona conditioning shapes clinical decisionmaking and risk alignment in safety-critical settings."

            "content": "Personas as Behavioral Steering Mechanisms Personas are widely used to steer LLM behavior by framing models as particular roles or agents (Shanahan et al., 2023; Hwang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a). Prior work has employed role conditioning to elicit diverse behaviors, support adversarial testing through persona-driven red-teaming, or simulate different user perspectives (Deng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025). Recent studies show that role-playing personas can influence model reasoning and output characteristics, suggesting that personas offer flexible mechanism for shaping behavior (Kim et al., 2024a; Zheng et al., 2024). However, existing evaluations provide limited examination of how persona-conditioned outputs are perceived by human evaluators, or how these perceptions relate to safety-critical properties such as calibration, consistency, and risk posture in high-stakes decision-making. Personas in Healthcare Contexts In healthcare, personas have primarily been used to model patientside variation to construct datasets and evaluate robustness (Kyung et al., 2025) and to instantiate clinician agents for workflow emulation and multiagent collaboration (Kim et al., 2024b; Gaber et al., 2025). While these approaches demonstrate the utility of personas for simulation and interaction studies, they generally assume that professionally grounded personas improve clinical reasoning and task performance. Whether such personas systematically affect safety-relevant behavior, calibration, consistency, and risk posture in decision-support settings remains largely unexplored. Latent Persona Representations and Functional Consequences Beyond prompt-based conditioning, recent work has identified latent activationspace representations associated with behavioral 2 traits such as sycophancy or hallucination propensity (Chen et al., 2025; Golovanevsky et al., 2025). This line of research emphasizes mechanistic interpretability and training-time control of internal behavioral tendencies. While promising, such approaches operate at the level of model internals and typically require specialized access during training or inference, which may not be available in typical deployment settings, including clinician-facing clinical systems (Mesinovic et al., 2025). Moreover, the connection between these latent representations and their functional consequences on complex reasoning tasks, especially in safety-critical clinical decision-making, remains poorly understood."

            "content": "We structure our study around three research questions: RQ1: How does persona conditioning affect clinical performance and safety? RQ2: How do interaction styles influence model risk posture? RQ3: How do LLM judges and clinicians perceive persona-induced differences? 3.1 Personas as Behavioral Priors We study persona conditioning as single-factor behavioral intervention for steering LLM behavior in clinical decision-making tasks. Our evaluation spans two safety-critical clinical scenarios: (i) clinical triage, encompassing emergency triage (high-acuity, time-sensitive cases) and primarycare triage (lower-acuity cases), and (ii) patientsafety recommendations. Personas are designed to reflect roles and interaction styles that may impose distinct behavioral priors under safety pressure. Following prior work (Gaber et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2024b), each persona condition is instantiated by appending one-sentence role-defining instruction at the system level using the template: You are {persona}. All persona variants differ only in this declaration; task instructions, inputs, decoding parameters, and label extraction procedures are held fixed across conditions. Personas are defined along two orthogonal axes: professional role and interaction style, as summarized in Figure 1. Professional role This axis encodes the occupational context. We define personas corresponding to an Emergency Department (ED) physician and an ED nurse, reflecting distinct clinical responsibilities and authority levels in high-stakes decisionmaking environments. Interaction style To isolate stylistic effects while holding the professional role constant, we vary the ED physician persona by specifying the interaction style. We define bold and cautious variants, enabling analysis of risk modulation independent of role identity. This dimension is applied exclusively to the ED physician persona to limit the experimental search space. Non-medical controls We include two nonmedical control conditions: standard Helpful Assistant persona and No Persona condition in which the system prompt is left unmodified. These controls establish baseline for distinguishing clinically grounded persona effects from generic assistant behavior. 3.2 Behavioral Evaluation Dimensions To characterize the effects of the persona conditioning, we evaluate model behavior across complementary dimensions, capturing performance, risk posture, and decision stability. 3.3 Quantitative Metrics Accuracy Accuracy is measured as the proportion of model predictions that match reference labels for each task. While accuracy remains necessary baseline for evaluating clinical utility, it is insufficient to characterize safety-critical behavior in clinical settings. Risk propensity Risk propensity is defined as the frequency with which persona assigns highurgency labels (e.g., Emergency) across all cases, irrespective of reference severity. This metric captures the models inherent bias toward escalation and reflects its default clinical posture under uncertainty. Risk sensitivity Risk sensitivity is assessed by analyzing error asymmetry conditioned on reference labels. Errors are categorized as: Type Error (Over-triage): Assigning high urgency to low-risk case. This constitutes conservative failure mode that prioritizes patient safety at the cost of resource efficiency. Type II Error (Under-triage): Assigning low urgency to high-risk case. This represents permissive failure mode that risks delayed care and adverse clinical outcomes. We define personas risk sensitivity as the relative prevalence of Type versus Type II errors (ET ypeI /ET ypeII ), computed over evaluation instances where an error occurs. Importantly, neither error type is uniformly preferable; the appropriate balance depends on clinical context. This analysis tests whether personas shift safety behavior in targeted manner rather than inducing uniform change in decision frequency. Consistency Rate Prior work (Wang et al., 2024b) has shown that the latent and generated labels in LLMs can diverge substantially. We adapt this insight as diagnostic probe to assess whether persona conditioning primarily modulates decoding behavior or latent preferences. For each input, we perform single generation pass using fixed decoding parameters and extract two labels: Latent preference (ylogit): the highest likelihood class from valid set {A, B, C}, computed using standard logit-based evaluation (Gao et al., 2024; Hendrycks et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2024b). Generated label (ygen): the class parsed from the generated output. (cid:80)N The Consistency Rate (CR) is the percentage of valid, parsable responses where the generated label matches the logit-predicted label: CR = 100 1 i=1 1(ygen,i = ylogit,i), where is the number of valid, parsable responses (unparsable outputs are excluded). high CR indicates strong alignment between latent preferences and generated outputs, meaning the model generates outputs that align with its internal scoring. low CR signals that contextual or decoding effects shift the response away from the latent ranking. This analysis tells us whether persona effects operate primarily through decoding-level modulation (reducing consistency) rather than shifts in latent preferences (preserving consistency). Calibration In safety-critical clinical settings, users may rely on calibrated probabilities to quantify model uncertainty (Shorinwa et al., 2025). We assess calibration to determine whether models predicted probability for chosen decision aligns with its empirical correctness. For each input, we compute conditional log-likelihoods for all valid labels in and apply softmax to obtain probability distribution over categories. Calibration is quantified using Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (Naeini et al., 2015). Lower ECE indicates better alignment between predicted confidence and empirical accuracy. Unlike internal consistency, calibration evaluates the reliability of confidence estimates rather than agreement between scoring and generation. 3.4 Qualitative Metrics 3.4.1 LLM-based Evaluation To assess qualitative aspects not captured by aggregate performance metrics, we employ panel of three distinct LLMs as judges following prior work (Verga et al., 2024), to mitigate biases from single evaluator. Judges evaluate model outputs along two criteria: 1. Clinical Reasoning Quality: Judges assess decision justification quality, measuring clinical plausibility and coherence of the reasoning trace. 2. Safety Compliance: Judges evaluate (i) harmfulness, (ii) helpfulness, and (iii) factual accuracy relative to medical knowledge. judges are presented with For each input, anonymized responses generated under different personas and are asked to rank them according to the applicable criteria. Aggregated rankings for each persona are measured using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), = 1 , where ranki dei=1 notes the position assigned to personas response, for instance i. 1 ranki (cid:80)N 3.4.2 Human Clinician Evaluation Recent work increasingly relies on LLM-based judges to evaluate model behavior (Verga et al., 2024; Sanni et al., 2025), yet it remains unclear whether such automated preferences align with expert clinical judgment in safety-critical settings. We therefore conduct blinded clinician evaluation to assess (i) whether persona-driven behavioral differences identified by LLM judges are perceptible to human experts, and (ii) whether LLM-judge preferences correspond to clinician assessments of clinical utility and safety. Three clinicians participated in the evaluation: two attending physicians with over ten years of clinical practice and one recent medical graduate. The clinicians were presented with paired, anonymized model responses and asked to indicate which response they preferred based on overall clinical utility and perceived safety. To isolate persona effects and ensure that evaluated cases exhibit clear behavioral contrasts, we emFigure 2: Persona effects on Clinical Triage. Bars show relative to no-persona baseline. On average, medical Personas improve emergency performance but degrade primary care performance, with model-dependent effects on consistency. Arrows represent the directionality of the metric. * represents statistical significance. ploy consensus-based sampling strategy. For each task category, we select 50 instances in which all three LLM judges unanimously agreed in ranking one persona over the others (25 medical-preferred and 25 non-medical-preferred). This design enables direct comparison of LLM-judge preferences with expert clinical judgment for cases with strong, consistent signals. We collected their responses via the Argilla annotation platform (see Appendix for details)."

            "content": "We evaluate persona-driven behavior across two medical domains: clinical triage classification and open-ended patient-facing safety interactions. Clinical Triage We use cohort of 1,466 emergency department patients with suspected transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke (20132020) from an urban academic observational unit (Khatri et al., 2025). Each case includes structured intake features (e.g., presenting symptoms, vital signs, and medical history). To extend coverage to lower-acuity scenarios, we supplement this cohort with 201 symptom-based routine-care cases (Fraser et al., 2023). Reference triage labels reflect clinically appropriate care at presentation and serve as the evaluation target. The task is framed as three-way classification: (A) stay home/selfcare, (B) seek routine or primary care, or (C) seek emergency care. Patient Safety Compliance We use PatientSafetyBench (Corbeil et al., 2025), publicly available dataset, which probes adherence to five safety categories: harmful medical advice, misdiagnosis and overconfidence, unlicensed medical practice, health misinformation, and bias or stigmatization across 466 queries. It consists of open-ended patient queries designed to elicit safety-relevant behaviors. Model responses are analyzed to assess how persona conditioning affects safety, factuality, and helpfulness in patient-facing interactions. Persona Conditioning Models We evaluate persona interventions across five state-of-the-art clinical LLMs. Our primary cohort is the HuatuoGPTo1 series (Chen et al., 2024) designed for advanced medical reasoning. We evaluate four variants with different backbones: HuatuoGPT-o1-8B (LLaMA-3.1-8B), HuatuoGPT-o1-70B (LLaMA3.1-70B), HuatuoGPT-o1-7B (Qwen2.5-7B), and HuatuoGPT-o1-72B (Qwen2.5-72B). For comparison, we include MedGemma-27B (Sellergren et al., 2025); unlike the HuatuoGPT-o1 series, it does not generate reasoning traces. Judge Models For LLM-based evaluation (Section 3.4.1), we use panel of three models: GPT-5, HuatuoGPT-o1-70B, and HuatuoGPT-o1-72B. Using multiple judges provides diverse perspectives and reduces bias from any single evaluator. Full prompt templates and persona formulations are provided in Appendix D. Statistical Analysis For task-level performance, we conduct paired significance testing between persona-conditioned and baseline prompts. Binary outcomes (accuracy and consistency rate) are evaluated using McNemars non-parametric test with continuity correction on matched evaluation instances. For LLM-based pairwise rankings, we apply paired t-test to MRR scores across instances. Unless otherwise stated, statistical significance is assessed at < 0.05."

            "content": "5.1 Persona-Induced Shifts Figure 2 illustrates that across models and settings, medical personas induce systematic but contextdependent behavioral shifts. In emergency care scenarios, conditioning with emergency-oriented personas (ED Physician, ED Nurse) consistently improves task performance relative to the Helpful Assistant and No Persona baselines. These improvements manifest as gains in accuracy ( +20 pp) and improved calibration ( 20 pp), with several effects reaching statistical significance. Effects on consistency are more model-dependent. While larger models such as HuatuoGPT-72B show notable gains in consistency ( +4 pp), other models exhibit mixed or neutral effects. This suggests that persona-induced improvements operate through distinct mechanisms across models: some benefit from increased alignment between latent preferences and generation (consistency), while others improve primarily through gains in accuracy and calibration. The consistent gains under ED Physician and ED Nurse personas indicate that rolespecific conditioning influences decision-making policies beyond surface-level style. In primary care scenarios, however, the same medical personas frequently degrade performance. We observe reductions in accuracy ( 10 pp), substantial drops in consistency for some smaller models ( 20 pp), and worsening calibration relative to non-medical baselines. This reversal suggests that personas optimized for high-acuity contexts become misaligned when applied to loweracuity clinical tasks. When aggregated across all cases, these opposing effects cancel each other out, yielding modest net improvements. Overall, these results indicate that medical persona conditioning functions as context-sensitive behavioral prior, improving performance under high-acuity conditions and degrading performance in lower-acuity settings rather than yielding uniform gains. Crucially, these effects become visible only through systematic, taskstratified evaluation across multiple behavioral dimensions; aggregate accuracy or single-task analyses would mask both the benefits and the safetyrelevant failure modes induced by persona conditioning. Figure 3: Interaction style effects Risk Propensity (left) and Risk Sensitivity (right) on Clinical Triage. 5.2 Interaction-Style Effects Holding the ED Physician role constant, we compare cautious and bold variants against the base profiles using risk propensity and risk sensitivity. As illustrated in Figure 3, interaction style induces measurable, non-monotonic, and directionally inconsistent shifts in risk behavior across models. In some models (HuatuoGPT-72B, MedGemma27B, and HuatuoGPT-7B), both bold and cautious variants modestly increase risk propensity (up to +0.04) relative to the ED Physician baseline. For HuatuoGPT-72B and 7B, the cautious variant exhibits higher risk propensity than the bold variant (e.g., 0.72 vs. 0.69 for 72B). In contrast, for MedGemma-27B and HuatuoGPT8B, the ordering is reversed, with bold variants 6 (a) Patient Safety Compliance (medical roles). (b) Clinical Triage (medical roles). (c) Patient Safety Compliance (interaction styles). Figure 4: Performance on LLM-based evaluation. (a) LLM judges prefer medical personas across safety dimensions.

(c) LLM judges perceive Cautious variants as safer than Bold. * represents statistical significance. showing slightly higher propensity than cautious (e.g., 0.87 vs. 0.85 for 27B). Risk sensitivity exhibits even stronger model dependence, with some models (HuatuoGPT-70B, MedGemma-27B, and HuatuoGPT-7B) being substantially more risksensitive than others (HuatuoGPT-72B and 8B). Relative to the ED Physician baseline, the cautious variant increases risk sensitivity for HuatuoGPT72B, HuatuoGPT-70B, and HuatuoGPT-7B (e.g., 0.14 vs. 0.01 for 72B). In contrast, Bold variants exhibit higher risk sensitivity for MedGemma-27B and HuatuoGPT-8B (e.g., 0.73 vs. 0.53 for 27B). Overall, medical roles induce higher risk propensity and risk sensitivity than non-persona baselines, with increases of up to 0.21 in propensity (HuatuoGPT-7B) and up to 0.76 in sensitivity (HuatuoGPT-70B). However, interaction style does not provide monotonic or reliable mechanism for controlling risk posture. These results demonstrate that interaction style is not reliable control mechanism for clinical risk posture. Stylistic prompts produce directionally inconsistent effects that challenge their use as safety controls in high-stakes decision-making. 5.3 LLM Judge Preferences Ground-truth labels are often unavailable in clinical decision support settings, requiring evaluation based on perceived safety and reasoning quality. Focusing on larger models, we assess whether LLM judges systematically prefer certain persona and interaction-style variants in perceived safety, helpfulness, and justification quality. Across all evaluation datasets, inter-annotator agreement on the top-ranked personas is low (between 43% to 53% majority agreement; 0 to 0.1 Cohens κ); when rankings are aggregated across cases, statistically significant differences emerge between persona conditions. This indicates that persona effects manifest as consistent population-level shifts in perceived quality rather than as unanimous case-level preferences. On Patient Safety Compliance, Figure 4a shows that medical personas are ranked higher than non-medical baselines in perceived safety (lower harmfulness), helpfulness, and factual accuracy, with several differences reaching statistical significance. Figure 4c shows that interaction styles introduce trade-offs: cautious variants are often perceived as safer than bold variants, although their relative ordering with respect to the base medical persona is model-dependent. Crucially, these aggregate gains mask critical, categoryspecific degradations (Appendix F). For emergency triage justifications (Figure 4b), medical personas are again preferred over non-medical baselines, with ED Physician receiv7 (a) Confidence distribution of human clinicians preferences. Clinicians are more confident in their preferences for the safety compliance task. (b) Cohens κ between judges on 16 safety responses with >=50% confidence levels.

In primary care, these advantages attenuate or disappear, mirroring the context-dependent performance patterns observed in task-based evaluations. Importantly, these rankings reflect perceived alignment and justification quality rather than task correctness or guaranteed clinical safety. 5.4 Clinician Preferences Here, we examine whether LLM-based judgments align with expert clinician preferences. We assess clinician preferences across persona conditions on (i) safety compliance (Patient Safety Compliance) and (ii) justification quality (clinical triage), with clinicians ranking responses and reporting confidence in each judgment. Confidence (%) Reasoning Quality (%) Safety Compliance (%) 50 70 Medical (59.2) Medical (65.5) Medical (77.5) Medical (83.0) Table 1: Persona preference by task and confidence threshold. Clinicians prefer medical personas over non-medical baselines for safety compliance  (Table 1)  , expressing moderate to high confidence in these judgments. This indicates that persona-induced differences in safety-critical behavior are salient and meaningful to experts. In contrast, clinicians report substantially lower confidence when evaluating justification quality in triage responses (Figure 5a), suggesting that stylistic and explanatory differences are more difficult to assess consistently. Inter-annotator agreement further reflects this asymmetry. While clinicians reach moderate agreement on safety compliance judgments (average Cohens κ = 0.43 in mediumand high-confidence cases), agreement on justification quality could not be computed as 95.9% of the responses had low confidence levels (Figure 5b). Overall, human evaluation suggests that medical personas improve perceived safety compliance, whereas their effects on justification quality in clinical triage are ambiguous and inconsistent, even among expert clinicians. This validates LLM judges on safety compliance and, to lesser extent, on reasoning quality: clinicians prefer medical personas for both, with stronger confidence and consensus on safety. Medical personas, therefore, improve perceived safety more reliably than justification quality, distinction clarified by human evaluation."

In this work, we show that persona conditioning functions as behavioral prior that systematically reshapes the models risk posture, consistency, and failure modes. Through multidimensional evaluation spanning clinical triage and medical safety red-teaming, we demonstrate that the effects of medical personas are strong, measurable, and, more crucially, nonmonotonic and context-dependent. Our findings reveal persona conditioning as double-edged intervention, underscoring the need for context-aware evaluation and deployment. More broadly, our results challenge the assumption that stronger domain grounding uniformly improves safety, and motivate shift toward interpretable, task-conditional evaluation frameworks for controllable LLM behavior in high-stakes domains."

            "title": "7 Limitations",
            "content": "This study provides an essential framework to conduct systematic analysis of medical personas as behavioral priors for LLMs in clinical settings. However, this work has some limitations that will be addressed in future work. First, we evaluate limited set of professionally grounded personas, focusing on Emergency Department (ED) roles and interaction styles. While appropriate for studying high-acuity decision-making, this does not cover the whole space of clinically relevant roles (e.g., primary care physicians or specialists), which may exhibit different behavioral effects under persona conditioning. Second, our evaluation emphasizes tasks with clearly varying clinical criticality: clinical triage (spanning emergency and primary care categories) and patient safety recommendations, which span five critical categories. Consequently, non-monotonic and context-dependent effects are most pronounced in triage, where risk posture differences are explicit, and less pronounced in patient safety benchmarks, where criticality is more uniform and aggregate trends can mask categoryspecific failures. Third, although we include both LLM-based and human clinician evaluations, the human assessments are limited in scale due to annotation costs and expertise requirements. As result, our human evaluation focuses on trends in preference and agreement rather than fine-grained case-level judgments. Finally, we study persona conditioning as lightweight, prompt-based intervention and do not evaluate training-time or latentcontrol methods, which may provide stronger guarantees but are less common and less accessible for deployment. Our conclusions, therefore, apply specifically to prompt-level persona conditioning commonly used in clinical LLM systems. Despite these limitations, our results show that even minimal persona conditioning can induce large, contextdependent behavioral shifts, highlighting the need for systematic evaluation prior to deployment."

            "content": "E.1 Annotation The aim of the human evaluation was to directly compare LLM-judge preferences with clinician preferences. Our annotation guidelines closely followed the evaluation criteria provided to the LLM judge - the only difference being that the LLM judge ranked all persona responses, while the human annotators were only required to choose the better from two persona responses. The responses selected for human evaluation were those where the LLM judges had clear consensus for medical (25 instances) and non-medical (25 instances) personas. The annotators thus indicated preference between two responses (one from medical persona and one from non-medical persona) at time. This ensured that evaluation cases exhibited clear behavioral contrasts and clinicians were not overly burned with high cognitive load of evaluating low contrast responses from multiple personas. The annotators were provided with the following information: the task prompt provided to the clinical LLM for the two tasks; two model responses (thinking traces plus final response label for assessing reasoning quality in clinical triage and model responses for patient safety compliance); annotation guidelines that explained the task setup, judgment parameters (same as provided to the LLM judge), and annotator confidence levels. The annotators returned their preference between the two responses and additionally their confidence level, between 0-100. 13 Three clinicians, based in the US and Germany, volunteered in the blinded evaluation: Clinician & B: Attending physicians with >10 years of clinical experience. Clinician C: Recent medical graduate (MD completed within the last year). All clinicians are fluent in English and have experience in emergency or primary care settings. They were blinded to model identities, persona labels, and the source of each response during the evaluation. Each annotator was individually given an orientation about the annotation tasks and was provided with documentation to refer to during the annotation process. The clinicians contributed to the human evaluation as part of the research team and are co-authors on this paper. E.2 Annotation Platform We collected the annotations on the Argilla data annotation platform, https://argilla.io/, free open-source tool to annotate datasets. We deployed the Argilla UI on private server, created two datasets for the two task-specific judgment criteria (reasoning quality and safety compliance), each comprising 50 instances. We created three user accounts, one for each annotator. The annotators were then provided with the link to each dataset and their individual login credentials. They were given one week to complete the task. E.3 Statistics We received 149 responses for the reasoning quality and 150 responses for the safety compliance evaluations. These responses were manually inspected to remove any formatting issues, for instance, trailing spaces and additional comments in the text input field for confidence level reporting."

            "content": "F.1 Category-Level LLM-Judge Evaluation Patient Safety Bench tasks span five clinically relevant safety categories. Using LLM judges, we evaluate persona-conditioned outputs along three dimensions: Safety (perceived harmfulness), Helpfulness, and Factual Accuracy for the HuatuoGPT72B and HuatuoGPT-70B models. Figures 6 and 7 summarize persona effects across safety categories. Overall, medical personas are often but not uniformly preferred over non-medical baselines. Importantly, persona conditioning can degrade performance in specific safety-critical categories, revealing model and category-dependent failure modes. Figure 6: Category level persona effects on patient safety tasks (HuatuoGPT-72B Model). Figure 7: Category level persona effects on patient safety tasks (HuatuoGPT-70B Model). Across both models, non-medical baselines (Helpful Assistant, No Persona) are consistently ranked lower on average, reflected by fewer highranking (green) cells across evaluation dimensions. In HuatuoGPT-72B, medical personas generally outperform non-medical baselines in Misdiagnosis, Harmful Medical Advice, and Bias & Discrimination across all dimensions. Similarly, HuatuoGPT70B shows medical personas leading in Misdiagnosis, Health Misinformation, and Bias & Discrimination. prior over the underlying safety guardrails present in the base assistant. Taken together, these results demonstrate that persona conditioning does not provide uniformly safer response profile. Instead, personas interact with model-specific weaknesses, sometimes amplifying risk rather than mitigating it. This highlights the necessity of category-level and model-specific evaluations when deploying persona-conditioned clinical LLMs, as aggregate safety improvements can be deceptive. However, this aggregate trend masks substantial heterogeneity and critical reversals. Granular analysis reveals multiple instances where nonmedical baselines outperform specialist roles. or HuatuoGPT-72B, the No Persona baseline surpasses the ED Physician on Helpfulness for Unlicensed Medical Practice (M RR 0.55 vs. 0.52) and on Safety for Health Misinformation (M RR 0.56 vs. 0.55). In HuatuoGPT-70B, No Persona outperforms the ED Physician on both Safety and Helpfulness in Unlicensed Medical Practice, while the ED Nurse yields lower Factual Accuracy than the Helpful Assistant for Misdiagnosis and Health Misinformation. This suggests that persona conditioning may inadvertently trigger overconfidence or latent biases associated with professional roles, leading the model to prioritize specific behavioral"
