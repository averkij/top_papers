            "content": "As humans, we use narratives to express our representations of reality and make sense of the world (Bruner, 1990). Through written narratives, authors communicate events and reveal their unique ways of perceiving and interpreting reality. Personal narratives, the self-crafted stories authors create to make sense of their experiences, are rich sources for understanding how authors shape their identity and meaning-making (Labov and Waletzky, 1997). Style has long been recognized as key element in how authors express themselves through lanIn everyday usage, style refers to disguage. Table 1: Illustrative pipeline for our sequence-based framework.

While this general definition encompasses all aspects of personal expression, our work narrows the focus to specifically examine how individuals linguistically encode their subjective experiences in personal narratives. Our approach complements existing works in stylometry (Neal et al., 2017) and stylistics (Wales, 2014) by providing formal framework grounded in systemic functional linguistics (Halliday et al., 2014), which views language as system of options for achieving communicative goals. This perspective aligns with how authors construct personal narratives, as they select from available linguistic resources to convey their subjective experience. Scholarly investigations have long explored personal modes of reasoning and expression. For example, Husserls phenomenology examined how intentional structures of consciousness shape lived experience (Husserl, 2012), Hadamard analyzed the cognitive processes underlying mathematical creativity (Hadamard, 1945), and Dilts modelled the problem-solving strategies of figures such as Leonardo da Vinci and Sherlock Holmes (Dilts, 1994). In his philosophy of style, Gilles-Gaston 1https://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/style Granger defined style as the individual response to the difficulties faced by any structuring endeavor (Granger, 1968). While these qualitative frameworks richly describe personal modes of thought, they do not provide operational tools for capturing how such styles manifest in linguistic form. formalization of the intuitive notion of style in personal narratives is lacking. In therapeutic settings, where narrative reconstruction can facilitate healing (White and Epston, 1990), formalization could enable more precise identification of linguistic patterns associated with psychological states and support targeted interventions. Tellier and Finkel (1995) propose formal framework to characterize individual patterns between texts written by the same author. They propose definition of linguistic style as lexical and syntactical patterns in the expressions of an intention. Drawing on these ideas, we develop sequencebased framework to analyze how personal narratives convey subjective experience. Table 1 shows an illustrative pipeline for our framework. We represent narratives as sequences of linguistic choices, identifying recurring patterns in how authors encode their experiences. We do not claim to capture the full complexity of subjective experience in text. We aim to create simple, accessible framework that researchers can use across disciplines and build upon in future studies. Our key contributions are: 1. sequence-based framework defining style as patterns in sequences of linguistic choices grounded in systemic functional linguistics; 2. methodology for automatically identifying patterns using sequence analysis; 3. case study on dream narratives, showing how the analysis of patterns can reveal psychological insights and support therapeutic applications. Our research task is to formalise style in personal narratives as patterns of linguistic choices that encode subjective experience, and to demonstrate that this formalisation yields interpretable empirical findings. Section 2 shows our categorization of linguistic features grounded in functional linguistics and how these features can be organized as sequences of symbols. Section 3 presents methods for analyzing patterns in these sequences. Section 4 demonstrates our framework through case study on dream narratives. Finally, we conclude and propose many applications (e.g., authorship profiling, style-conditioned narrative generation) and theoretical extensions (applying methods from complexity science and formal language theory)."

            "title": "2 Categorizing Linguistic Features",
            "content": "What linguistic features are relevant for analyzing the communication of subjective experience? This section presents our categorization of linguistic features based on functional linguistic theories. In these theories, language is seen primarily as means to achieve communicative goals. Functional linguistics often draws on various disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, and cognitive science, to explore how language functions. We rely on fundamental function of language: the communication of subjective experience. It is through this notion that we define our concept of style. We introduce the various functional linguistic theories related to this function, then we present our categorization of features based on systemic functional linguistics. Functions of language Karl Bühlers organon model represents one of the earliest attempts to categorize language functions (Bühler, 1990). He identified three fundamental functions: representation (encoding external reality), expression (revealing internal states), and appeal (influencing receivers of messages). The expressive function is particularly relevant to our analysis, as it specifically addresses how language manifests the internal state of the writer through linguistic choices, independent of both representational content and intended receiver effects. Roman Jakobson later expanded this model into six-function framework (Jakobson, 2010). Systemic functional linguistics Sharing conceptual roots with Bühlers and Jakobsons models of language, systemic functional linguistics, developed by Michael Halliday, offers framework for analyzing how language functions as meaningmaking resource (Halliday et al., 2014). Rather than viewing language as set of abstract rules, systemic functional linguistics examines it as social semiotic system where meaning emerges through contextual linguistic choices. This approach is particularly valuable for analyzing personal narratives, as it provides tools for understanding how authors select and combine linguistic resources to construct meaning from their experiences. Systemic functional linguistics identifies three metafunctions: inProcesses Action: actions and events in the physical world. Examples [He]Actor [takes]Action [the valuable]Affected Mental: internal experiences such as thoughts, perceptions, and feelings. Verbal: acts of communication. State: states of being, having, or existence. [Members of my cult]Actor [have made]Action [1500 euros]Result [I]Actor [give]Action [her]Recipient [a chance]Range [We]Senser [believe]Mental [women are the leaders of change]Phenomenon [The moon]Senser [sees]Mental [the earth]Phenomenon [He]Senser [disliked]Mental [Gilberts writing]Phenomenon [David]Sayer launderers]Verbiage There [was]Existential [a swimming pool]Existent [said]Verbal corrupt, [the criminals and money [John]Carrier [is]State [an interesting teacher]Attribute [Hadrians Wall]Possessor [has]State [something for everyone]Possessed Table 2: Processes with their participants. terpersonal (how language is used to build and maintain social relationships), textual (how information is organized to create coherent messages), and ideational (how language represents experience through the transitivity system described below). Our framework particularly leverages the transitivity system, analyzing how authors encode their experiences through processes, participants, and circumstances. Processes, participants, and circumstances The transitivity system, which shares similarities with Lucien Tesnières concept of valency (Tesnière, 2015), provides framework for analyzing how clauses represent experiences through the interaction of processes, participants, and circumstances. Processes (realized through verbal phrases), participants (realized through noun phrases), and circumstances (realized through adverbial groups or prepositional phrases) form the Inspired by core of experiential representation. Banks (2019), Table 2 presents our categorization of process types. Although there exists finer categorization of processes (for example, the division of mental processes into cognitive, affective, and perceptive processes), we limit ourselves to general categorization to save space. The definitions of participants and examples of circumstances can be found in Tables 3 and 4 (Appendix A). We define style as patterns in choices within system of linguistic features inspired by the transitivity system in systemic functional linguistics. We now need to explain what is choice. To account for subjective experience, an author makes series of choices within system of features."

            "title": "3.1 Formalizing Choice",
            "content": "Grammar as system of meaningful choices Systemic functional linguistics views grammar as network of meaningful choices (Halliday et al., 2014). This paradigmatic dimension emphasizes how linguistic units are selected from available options (de Saussure, 1916). When constructing clauses, authors select features from the transitivity system to encode their experience, making choices that fulfill specific communicative functions. Formal representation of feature systems We represent each system of linguistic features as finite set Σ containing available choices, also called an alphabet in formal language theory (Pin, 2021). For example, the alphabet of process types is = {action, mental, verbal, state}. Σprocess construct Using word with five as such action.mental.action.mental.state where . is the concatenation operator. Multiple alphabets can be combined through cartesian products, allowing the representation of simultaneous choices across different linguistic dimensions. For can letters, alphabet, we this = example, we can have finer-grained analysis with processes along with their tense and aspect: Σ = Σprocess Σtense Σaspect. Our case study on dream narratives is simple proof of concept where we only focus on process types. Future works could incorporate more features, hence larger alphabet, for finer-grained analysis. 3.2 Sequence Analysis Substrings and subsequences We analyze sequences to identify two types of recurring patterns: substrings and subsequences. substring is any contiguous block of symbols occurring within longer string. subsequence is obtained by deleting zero or more symbols while preserving their relative order, so contiguity is not required. For example, action.action is subsequence of action.mental.state.action but not substring, whereas action.mental is both substring and subsequence. Both notions come from the computer science terminology and underpin large family of string-processing algorithms (Knuth et al., 1977). In formal language theory, substrings and subsequences are called factors and subwords (Berstel and Perrin, 2007). Our study focuses on substrings, but our framework can be easily extended to consider subsequences. Identifying recurring substrings such as action.mental within words can help detect patterns relevant to an authors style. For example, an author may tend to follow an action process with mental process. By applying this framework to larger corpora, we can explore how authors structure their narratives, revealing the patterns that shape how subjective experience is communicated. Analogy with computational biology As we aim to identify patterns in sequences of symbols, we can draw inspiration from concepts and methods developed in various fields that perform sequence analysis, such as computational biology (Waterman, 1995). For example, studying DNA or protein sequences in biology has led to the development of algorithms and similarity measures, notably through sequence alignment and complexity measures. These tools allow for identifying recurring patterns within sequences, quantifying the proximity between biological entities, and the inference of functional or evolutionary relationships. By analogy, if we replace nucleotides (A, C, G, T) with our linguistic features, we can employ these techniques to detect recurring patterns, measure the stylistic similarity between different narratives, and highlight patterns specific to certain authors. Similarity measures When comparing narratives, we focus on their stylistic patterns rather than their specific content by analyzing their associated sequences. While we could consider two narratives equal only if they have exactly the same sequence, this criterion is too strict for practical analysis. Instead, we need more flexible way to measure how similar two sequences are. We propose using cosine similarity, which treats sequences as vectors in high-dimensional space and measures the angle between them. For any two sequences s1 and s2, we first identify all possible substrings (contiguous subsequences) up to certain length. We then count how frequently each substring appears in each sequence to create frequency vectors. The similarity is calculated as: cos(s1, s2) = (cid:80) xiyi (cid:113)(cid:80) (cid:113)(cid:80) x2 i y2 where xi and yi represent the number of times particular substring appears in s1 and s2 respectively. This measure ranges from 0 (completely different) to 1 (identical), with higher values indicating greater similarity. For example, consider two sequences of process types: s1 = amvma and s2 = amma (where = action, = mental, = verbal). Their substrings of length one and two are: s1 : {a : 2, : 2, : 1, am : 1, mv : 1, vm : 1, ma : 1} and s2 : {a : 2, : 2, am : 1, mm : 1, ma : 1}. The cosine similarity between these sequences is 0.836. This high similarity reflects that they share many common substrings and have similar distributions of process types, even though s1 contains verbal process not present in s2. Other similarity measures could be used, such as the Jaccard similarity or Euclidean distance. Clustering We aim to find groups of narratives that reflect similar subjective experiences encoded in their patterns. We apply unsupervised clustering methods, particularly hierarchical agglomerative clustering (Ward, 1963), to automatically group similar sequences. This method constructs hierarchy (or dendrogram) of clusters in bottom-up manner. There is no need to specify the number of clusters as the methods produce full hierarchy, allowing the analyst to choose clustering level that best suits the needs. By examining the dendrogram, one can identify the number of clusters that reflect meaningful stylistic distinctions. For instance, one might observe that certain narratives cluster together at coarse level while finer-grained distinctions emerge deeper in the dendrogram. from hypothetical average dreamer. This norm comprises random sample of ten narratives from each series of DreamBank, resulting in collection of 720 dream narratives. Representative sequences One challenge in interpreting clustering results is to summarize each cluster in way that highlights its most characteristic features. Representative sequences can summarize what stylistically unites the narratives in cluster and offer starting point for qualitative interpretation. To select representative sequences, we compute the sequence with the smallest average distance to all other sequences in the cluster. In the next section, we apply sequence analysis methods to identify recurring patterns in dreams."

Our analysis uses DreamBank, corpus of thousands of dream narratives collected in the United States for scientific research. This English-language corpus has been employed in quantitative dream analysis (Domhoff and Schneider, 2008). The corpus is provided for academic research in dream and narrative analysis, and our usage strictly adheres to this intended purpose. From this corpus, we analyze five series of dreamers: blind (long-term blind dreamers, n=361), ed (a widower, n=139), izzy (a teenager, n=1091), merri (an artist, n=202), and viet (a Vietnam War veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, n=566). description of each series is accessible on the DreamBank website2. While this paper focuses on analyzing the viet series, we make the sequences of other series available. We construct norm to establish comparative baseline to compare how each series deviates 2https://www.dreambank.net/grid.cgi Methodology Prior research has demonstrated the effectiveness of language models in analyzing dream narratives for character and emotion prediction (Bertolini et al., 2023; Cortal, 2024). Previous studies have also shown that systemic functional linguistics can be valuable for analyzing text corpora (Banks, 2002). Our work represents the first attempt to automate analysis from systemic functional linguistics using language models, focusing on the ideational function, particularly the transitivity system. We automatically extract processes, participants, and circumstances from dream narratives. This automation eliminates the costly and timeconsuming manual extraction process that requires trained annotators and annotation campaigns. Our methodology begins with dividing dream narratives into sentences using SpaCy segmentation model3. We then separate sentences into clauses using language model with in-context examples (Dong et al., 2024). We do not differentiate between dependent and independent clauses. The next step involves extracting linguistic features using language model with in-context examples from systemic functional linguistics books (Banks, 2019; Halliday et al., 2014). We use Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, instruction tuned auto-regressive language model with 8-billion parameters (Grattafiori et al., 2024). This model was the best-performing 8B open-weights model at the time of our experiments4. We run our experiments using Tesla V100 32GB for 80 hours. As our sequence analysis depends on reliable extraction of linguistic features, we conducted quantitative validation of the language-model annotator. We randomly sampled 50 clauses from the examples in Banks (2019) and Halliday et al. (2014). These clauses are considered gold-standard because they are fully analysed in the textbooks. Predicted processes, participants and circumstances were all correctly matched to the references. We make our prompts and all extracted sequences available online for research use5. We acknowledge that our automatic extraction may 3en_core_web_trf-3.8.0 described at https://spacy.io 4https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/ open_llm_leaderboard 5https://github.com/gustavecortal/ formalizing-style-in-personal-narratives contain errors, such as misidentifying mental process as verbal process. Future work could evaluate our models against more expert annotations. Our framework benefits from the continuous improvement of language models. Llama 3.1 8B can be replaced with better language models in the future without altering the essence of our approach. 4.2 Analysis We apply sequence analysis methods to identify recurring patterns in sequences of choices extracted from dream narratives. We aim to identify patterns characterizing how subjective experience is communicated in dream narratives. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide simple case, we focus solely on the choice of processes. However, our approach can consider more complex configurations of linguistic features to identify finer-grained patterns. Our analysis focuses on the distribution of substrings and representative sequences of the war veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. We discuss the psychological implications of our findings. Distribution of substrings We compare the distribution of substrings between series of dreamers and an average dreamer (norm). To save space, we only compare substrings of sizes one, two, and In Figure 1, we take viet as an example. three. Comparisons with other series are available in Appendix A. We also report other statistics such as perseries distribution of sequence lengths (Figure 8) and number of distinct substrings in the series (Figure 5). We compare the proportion of sequences containing given substring between viet and norm using Fisher exact test (with HolmBonferroni correction) (Fisher, 1935). We focus on the presence or absence of substring within sequence: each substring is treated as categorical variable indicating whether or not it occurs in sequence. Odds ratio Figure 1 reports odds ratios with statistically significant results (p < 0.05). The odds ratio measures how much more (or less) likely it is to observe given substring in one series compared to another. For example, Figure 1a shows that the presence of verbal processes is 40% more likely in the sequences of viet than in norm, as we have an odds ratio of 1.4. The presence of mental processes is 40% less likely in the sequences of viet than in norm, as we have an odds ratio of 0.6. Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c show preference for viet to remain in verbal process, as indicated by substrings such as (a) Size 1. (b) Size 2. (c) Size 3. Figure 1: Top substring between viet and norm. verbal.verbal and verbal.verbal.verbal with high odds ratios (respectively 2.00 and 1.75). We save space by showing only substring sizes up to three. However, we analyze other sizes that reveal interesting patterns. For example, some substrings do not appear in viet but appear in norm, such as mental.state.mental.mental. Representative sequences We perform hierarchical agglomerative clustering on the sequences of viet to find representative sequences that cover an important portion (80%) of all sequences while minimizing intra-cluster distances. We use Ward linkage and cosine similarity. The silhouette score, which measures how similar sequences are to their own cluster compared to other clusters, reaches its maximum value with substrings of lengths up to three and when partitioning the dendrogram into two clusters (shown in orange and green in affect cognitive and emotional processing (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), though further research would be needed to confirm this interpretation. We aim to show that our formalization of style can help authors learn to reframe their experiences, potentially facilitating trauma processing. Our analysis relies solely on process types to show simple proof of concept. Future works will include fine-grained sequence analysis considering processes, participants, and circumstances. These building blocks can be further specified with features with functional role, such as the duration and completeness of processes (realized by tense and aspect) and the concreteness of participants."

This few-shot approach removes the need for handcrafted grammars or verb lexicons, and it scales to thousands of narratives without additional annotation effort. Computational analysis of dream narratives. Quantitative dream research traditionally depends on manual coding systems, which is labourintensive and difficult to scale. Ruleand lexiconbased methods map dream words to hand-curated dictionaries or WordNet synsets to identify characters, interactions, or emotions (Bulkeley and Graves, 2018; Fogli et al., 2020; Mallett et al., 2021; Zheng and Schweickert, 2021). Distributional approaches embed dreams in semantic space and cluster them by themes such as flight or fight (Altszyler et al., 2017; Sanz et al., 2018; Gutman Music et al., 2022). Hybrid systems add classifiers on top Figure 2: Dendrogram for viet based on substrings of size one, two, and three. Figure 2). This suggests two distinct patterns in how the veteran structures his subjective experience in dream narratives. We identified representative sequence for each cluster by calculating the sequence with the minimal average distance to all other sequences within its cluster. The first representative sequence (savamasasaaamaaasavvvaaaaaaavssaaaaa) demonstrates dominance of action processes (23 occurrences) with minimal mental processes (2) and covers 274 sequences with an average distance of 8 to other sequences in its cluster. The second representative sequence (sssssavaavssvsavvvvsmasasaasasaamaamvmsss) reveals more balanced pattern, featuring both action (13 occurrences) and state processes (16 occurrences) while maintaining relatively few mental processes (4), and covers 179 sequences with an average distance of 21. These patterns suggest that the veteran follows two templates: highly action-oriented structure or more varied structure alternating between state and action processes. Psychological interpretations We can bridge our analysis with therapeutic goals. Identifying lowor high-odd substrings could serve as diagnostic markers or guide therapy interventions. As therapists and patients collaborate to restructure narratives, certain stylistic elements can help target specific patterns for modification. For instance, mental processes occurring more frequently than average in an authors narratives might indicate an intensified inward focus. Conversely, relative scarcity of such patterns could suggest more action-oriented or externally focused stance. In our example, viet primarily frames his experiences through action and verbal rather than mental processes. This may align with studies about how combat trauma can of lexicon scores to predict overall sentiment or social themes (McNamara et al., 2019; Yu, 2022). Language-model approaches are only emerging: Bertolini et al. (2023) fine-tune BERT to detect the presence of emotions, and Cortal (2024) fine-tune sequence-to-sequence transformer to predict character and emotion. All of these approaches mainly focus on what is said (e.g., entities, emotions, or thematic content). In contrast, we target how subjective experience is constructed linguistically."

            "content": "We present novel framework that formalizes style in personal narratives as patterns in linguistic choices used to communicate subjective experience. By combining functional linguistics, sequence analysis methods, and psychological interpretations of sequential patterns, we analyze how authors encode their experiences through language. Our framework demonstrates the potential for uncovering psychologically meaningful patterns in dream narratives. The analysis of war veteran reveals distinctive patterns in process types, particularly prevalence of verbal processes over mental ones, suggesting links between linguistic choices and trauma processing. Our work opens directions for future research. Authorship profiling Authorship profiling aims to infer an authors demographic and psychological characteristics based on their written texts. Applications range from forensic linguistics (Gibbons, 2003) and literary attribution (Ledger and Merriam, 1994) to online security (Argamon et al., 2009) and bot detection (Ferrara et al., 2016). Our framework could enhance existing approaches to authorship attribution, particularly for texts where patterns related to subjective experience diagnose authorship. We can identify signature patterns (e.g., distinctive substrings) that characterize an authors unique way of constructing narratives. Style-conditioned narrative generation Language models have demonstrated increasing utility in psychotherapeutic applications (Cortal et al., 2023; Bonard and Cortal, 2024), particularly in text transformation tasks such as cognitive reframing of negative thoughts (Sharma et al., 2023) and generating positive perspectives (Ziems et al., 2022). While most research in controllable text generation has focused on high-level attributes like formality and sentiment (Jin et al., 2022; Troiano et al., 2023), recent work has shifted toward controlling finegrained linguistic attributes (Alhafni et al., 2024). Our sequence-based framework offers novel approach to controlling fine-grained attributes related to communicating subjective experience. While our current work focuses on structuring linguistic choices to characterize style from narratives, we could explore the inverse process: generating narratives from sequences of choices. This inverse mapping could enable style-conditioned narrative generation, offering new possibilities for therapeutic interventions or literary writing. Applying methods from complexity science and formal language theory While our current analysis focuses on substrings, analyzing subsequences might offer more flexible pattern detection as it involves non-contiguous patterns. Moreover, we could draw from complexity measures to quantify redundancies in sequences. For example, the Lempel-Ziv measure evaluates how efficiently sequence can be parsed into non-redundant substrings (Lempel and Ziv, 1976), low complexity indicating predictable patterns. These measures can reveal psychological insights: low complexity may indicate fixed mental representations or recurring cognitive schemas, particularly relevant in trauma cases, while higher complexity might suggest greater cognitive flexibility. This aligns with research applying complexity science to understand mental disorders (Carhart-Harris, 2018; Hipólito et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2015)."

            "content": "Our approach relies on language models to segment and annotate clauses. Although automation enables large-scale analysis, it can introduce inaccuracies when models misclassify processes or participants. Such inaccuracies can undermine the reliability of observed patterns. Improvements in model performance, as well as future efforts to validate or correct automated annotations using expert-annotated data, would help ensure more trustworthy results. While we connect patterns in linguistic choices to psychological interpretations, these connections remain correlational and descriptive. Identifying higher or lower prevalence of certain processes (e.g., mental or verbal) may hint at underlying psychological states, but these inferences are speculative. Validation against clinical assessments would be necessary to strengthen claims about the therapeutic utility of our stylistic analyses. Despite these limitations, our approach lays the groundwork for sequence-based, linguistically informed analysis of personal narratives. Future studies can address these limitations by expanding the range of linguistic features, refining extraction methods, and validating psychological interpretations with clinical data."
