            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Bridging the digital and physical worlds stands as one of the most profound frontiers in computer graphics and vision. While static 3D object creation has seen remarkable progress [Team 2025; Xiang et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024c], the synthesis of dynamic 3D content, also known as 4D, has lagged behind. 4D generation seeks to model not only how objects look but also how they move through time, holding the potential to redefine the fields of filmmaking, gaming, and virtual reality. In this work, we propose method for efficient and highquality 4D object generation from monocular videos, enabled by native 4D latent space that captures both spatial structure and temporal dynamics. Previous approaches to 4D content creation generally fall into two categories. The first line of works [Bahmani et al. 2024; Jiang et al. 2024; Ling et al. 2024; Zeng et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024b] leverages pre-trained multi-view and video generative models to optimize 4D representationssuch as 4D Gaussians and Dy-NeRFthrough intricate Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) [Poole et al. 2022] and its variants. While conceptually appealing, SDS-based methods often suffer from over-saturation artifacts and require hours of per-instance optimization. Another line of works[Sun et al. 2024; Yang et al. 2024a] refines video models for multi-view video generation and reconstructs 4D objects directly via photogrammetry losses. Though faster, these methods tend to yield coarse or noisy geometry and struggle to maintain spatio-temporal consistency, particularly under highly dynamic motion. Recent advances in native 3D generative models [Li et al. 2025; Team 2025; Xiang et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024c; Zhao et al. 2023] trained on large-scale 3D datasets [Deitke et al. 2023a,b] have demonstrated notable improvements in both quality and efficiency over SDS-based approaches [Chen et al. 2023; Liang et al. 2024; Lin et al. 2023; Poole et al. 2022; Qiu et al. 2024] and Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) [Hong et al. 2023; Li et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2024a]. Inspired by this evolutionary trajectory in 3D generation, we extend it into the 4D domain. Our method builds upon TRELLIS [Xiang et al. 2024], which encodes 3D objects as sparse voxel grids enriched with attribute channels, offering strong spatial inductive biases through the spatial locality inherent in sparse voxel structures. We propose SS4D, native 4D generative model capable of synthesizing dynamic 3D objects directly from monocular video input. Our approach extends TRELLIS into the spacetime domain by incorporating time as the fourth dimension in the latent space, while ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 44, No. 6, Article 243. Publication date: December 2025. retaining the strong spatial consistency provided by its structured latents representation. Specifically, we fine-tune TRELLISs autoencoder and generator with Temporal Layers and carefully designed 4D positional encodings to enforce consistency across frames. To improve long-term sequence generation, we apply temporal downsampling strategy via dedicated downsampling blocks and factorized 4D convolutions. Furthermore, we introduce progressive training schedule and random masking strategy to enhance robustness against occlusions and motion blur, both of which are common challenges in real-world video data. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks, including ObjaverseDy [Xie et al. 2024] and Consistent4D [Jiang et al. 2024], as well as real-world video sequences from DAVIS [Caelles et al. 2019]. Quantitative and qualitative results show that SS4D achieves state-of-the-art performance, generating high-quality, spatiotemporally consistent 4D objects with remarkable computational and memory efficiency. The generated 4D content and its voxelized structure by SS4D are visualized in Figure 1. We believe our model can serve as foundation for future work in 4D generation and unlock new possibilities in dynamic content creation."

            "content": "SDS-based 4D Generation. prominent line of research in 4D generation [Bahmani et al. 2024; Jiang et al. 2024; Ling et al. 2024; Ren et al. 2023; Yu et al. 2024; Zeng et al. 2024; Zheng et al. 2024] leverages Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with off-the-shelf pretrained models. These methods distill different types of priors: appearance priors: appearance priors [Ling et al. 2024] from text-to-image diffusion models, 3D priors [Ren et al. 2023; Zeng et al. 2024] from 3D-aware and multi-view diffusion models, and the motion priors [Ling et al. 2024] from video diffusion models. Consistent4D [Jiang et al. 2024] optimizes dynamic NeRF conditioned via SDS loss derived from 3D-aware image diffusion. 4D-fy [Bahmani et al. 2024] sequentially combines gradients from three distinct pretrained diffusion models to harness the strengths of each modality, thereby enhancing the quality of 4D generation. While SDS-based approaches effectively utilize diffusion priors to generate dynamic motion, they remain computationally expensive, often requiring several hours of optimization per object, and are prone to over-saturation artifacts. Feed-forward 4D Generation. Another line of work in 4D generation [Sun et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2024; Xie et al. 2024; Yang et al. 2024a; Yao et al. 2025] adopts feed-forward pipelines that avoid iterative optimization with SDS gradients. Diffusion2 [Yang et al. 2024a] and EG4D [Sun et al. 2024] leverage off-the-shelf video diffusion and multi-view diffusion to generate images at different viewpoints and timesteps using training-free techniques, followed by 4D reconstruction from the synthesized images. Other approaches [Wu et al. 2024; Xie et al. 2024; Yao et al. 2025] train multi-view multi-time diffusion with 4D datasets [Xie et al. 2024] or through combination of multi-view and video datasets. L4GM [Ren et al. 2024] extends LGM [Tang et al. 2024] to generate 3D Gaussians at each frame. However, most of these feed-forward methods rely on minimizing volumetric rendering losses on RGB images, which often leads to coarse or noisy geometry in the resulting 4D representations. SS4D: Native 4D Generative Model via Structured Spacetime Latents 243:3 Fig. 2. SS4D Overview. Left: SS4D pipeline. Our method takes monocular video as input. It extracts coarse voxel-based structure using 4D Flow Transformer, then generates spacetime latents through 4D Sparse Flow Transformer, both incorporating Temporal Layer to capture temporal consistency. These latents are subsequently decoded into sequence of 3D Gaussians, forming the final 4D content. Right: Temporal Layer. It combines temporal self-attention with shifted windows and hybrid 1D Rotary Position Embeddings to efficiently model dynamic 4D content and ensure consistency across frames. More recent methods aim to improve temporal consistency and geometric fidelity. V2M4 [Chen et al. 2025] first generates 3D meshes for individual frames, then enforces consistency through mesh registration and texture optimization. AnimateAnyMesh [Wu et al. 2025] and Puppeteer [Song et al. 2025] animate static 3D meshes using text or video prompts. The most relevant work, GVFDiffusion [Zhang et al. 2025] encodes canonical Gaussians and their temporal displacements into latent space using 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE. Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model is then trained on this latent space to generate 4D content. However, the canonical Gaussians are conditioned only on the first frame, the model may fail to match the appearance in subsequent frames, resulting in suboptimal performance. Our method directly synthesizes 4D objects using structured spacetime latent representation. By explicitly generating surfaces with geometric supervision, our framework produces more accurate 4D geometry that remains consistent across large viewpoint changes and aligns with the underlying motion."

            "content": "Our approach is built upon TRELLIS [Xiang et al. 2024], model for generating 3D assets from single image. TRELLIS introduces structured latents that effectively capture both the geometry and appearance of 3D objects. TRELLIS first transforms 3D asset into voxelized feature representation, defined as: TRELLIS encodes the voxelized feature 𝑓 into structured latents 𝑧 = (𝑓 ) = {(𝑧𝑖, 𝑝𝑖 )}𝐿 , 𝑧𝑖 R𝐷 , using 3D Variational Auto𝑖=1 Encoder (VAE) [Kingma and Welling 2014]. These latents can then be decoded into various 3D representations, including NeRF [Mildenhall et al. 2020], 3D Gaussians [Kerbl et al. 2023], and meshes. The generation of structured latents is decomposed into two stages: (1) generating the sparse structure {𝑝𝑖 }𝐿 𝑖=1, followed by (2) generating the latent features {𝑧𝑖 }𝐿 𝑖=1. Both stages employ generative models (G𝑆 for structure and G𝐿 for latents) that leverage Transformer-based Diffusion model (DiT) [Peebles and Xie 2023] architecture and the Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) objective [Lipman et al. 2023]."

𝑁 denotes the spatial resolution of the voxel grid, and 𝐿 is the total number of activated voxels. key insight in training native 4D generator is to leverage pretrained 3D generation model. However, extending 3D latent space to structured spacetime representation is non-trivial. While such models can produce high-quality 3D assets for individual frames, directly applying them to dynamic videos leads to noticeable temporal inconsistencies, as they lack temporal awareness. ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 44, No. 6, Article 243. Publication date: December 2025. 243:4 Zhibing Li, Mengchen Zhang, Tong Wu, Jing Tan, Jiaqi Wang, and Dahua Lin To address this, we extend the spatial self-attention layers of the pre-trained model into temporal self-attention layers. Specifically, we rearrange the temporal axis into the length dimension to perform attention, followed by reshaping to restore the original structure. The process, using einops [Rogozhnikov 2022] notation, is as follows: 𝑧 = rearrange(𝑧, (B T) (T M) C), 𝑧 = TemporalAttn(𝑧), 𝑧 = rearrange(𝑧, (T M) (B T) C), (2) where represents the batch size, is the number of temporal frames, is the attention length, and is the feature dimension. Given the local nature of temporal sequences and the quadratic complexity of full attention with increasing frame counts, we adopt shifted window attention [Liu et al. 2021] in temporal layers to improve efficiency. The temporal layers alternate between non-shifted and shifted window configurations, enabling both local context aggregation and global information exchange. An essential component of temporal attention is positional embedding. TRELLIS uses absolute position embedding [Vaswani et al. 2017] to encode 3D spatial coordinates. We retain this design to preserve spatial reasoning capabilities and further incorporate 1D Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) [Su et al. 2024] along the temporal axis to capture dynamic relationships between adjacent latents. This hybrid 4D positional encoding allows our model to generalize across varying sequence durations, despite being trained on fixed number of frames. The complete design of the temporal layer is shown on the right side of Figure 2. We find that temporal alignment of the diffusion model alone is insufficient. Since the VAE is trained exclusively on static 3D objects, it introduces flickering artifacts when encoding and decoding temporally coherent 4D features. To address this, we apply the same temporal alignment strategy to the VAE, enabling it to produce more coherent 4D reconstructions. As demonstrated in Section 5.3, this alignment significantly reduces jittering in the reconstructed Gaussians and is critical for achieving high-quality results."

            "title": "4.2 Long-Term Generation",
            "content": "Another major challenge in 4D generation is producing continuous 4D sequences from long videos. Previous works [Jiang et al. 2024; Ren et al. 2023; Zeng et al. 2024] often encounter issues such as quality degradation and inconsistency when generating long sequences, with optimization times increasing drastically. Given limited computational resources, generating spatiotemporally consistent 4D sequences remains significant challenge. To tackle this issue, SS4D incorporates the 1D Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) [Su et al. 2024], which enhances the models ability to extrapolate and generate 4D objects that extend beyond the training dataset. More importantly, considering the significant overlap of information between frames, we improve efficiency by compressing 4D representations of long sequences. In the 4D Sparse Flow Transformer stage, we generate structured spacetime latents {𝑧𝑖 }𝐿 𝑖=1. As shown in Figure 3, we explore 4D compression and convolutional network CompNet, which is specifically designed to compress and 𝑖=1 based on coarse structure {𝑝𝑖 }𝐿 ACM Trans.

The network captures longrange dependencies while preserving fine-grained spatial details and temporal consistency, ultimately enhancing the quality of the generated 4D sequences. Specifically, given the input structured spacetime latents 𝑧 R𝐿𝐷 , we first apply spatial 3D convolution and compression to each individual frame. sparse 3D convolution block [Contributors 2022; Wang et al. 2017] with space downsampling is employed to aggregate the latents within local region of size 23. Then, we apply sparse 1D convolutions [Contributors 2022] to facilitate information exchange across frames. Following this, temporal downsampling block is introduced to compress the latent features by packing two active voxels from the same 𝑥𝑦𝑧 position across frames. This module effectively compresses the frame length and reduces the computational load in subsequent Transformer modules. After the above compression, the timesteps are integrated through AdaLN layers, and video conditions are injected via multiple Transformer blocks, each containing Temporal Layer. The subsequently compressed latent 𝑧 is decompressed in the reverse order of CompNet. Meanwhile, during the decompression process, the convolutional upsampling block is connected to the downsampling block from the compression process through skip connections, facilitating the flow of spatial information. Finally, we restore the latent 𝑧 to its original structure."

            "content": "Data Curation. We curate dataset of 16,000 animated 3D objects from Objaverse [Deitke et al. 2023b] and ObjaverseXL [Deitke et al. 2023a], filtering out samples with low visual quality or minimal motion. During feature aggregation to activate voxels, we consider only the rendered views in which voxel is visible, rather than averaging across all views. Voxels that remain invisible in all views are discarded. This curation process not only reduces the length of the spacetime latents, enabling more efficient training, but also minimizes feature noise, leading to improved reconstruction quality. Progressive Learning. Animated objects from the Internet have different frame lengths. And directly training on long sequence causes slow to convergence. To fully utilize data and save training cost, we employ progressive learning strategy. That is, we first train on short animations to learn dynamic relationship among spacetime latents. Finally, we select subset of high-quality and long duration 4D data to finetune our model to cope with long sequences. Random Masking Augmentation. Real-world objects often appear in complex environments, where they may be partially occluded by surrounding elements or exhibit rapid motion that results in motion blursuch as during dancing or fast movement. To improve robustness to these real-world challenges, we introduce simple yet effective data augmentation strategy: randomly applying black masks to the conditioning video frames. This augmentation simulates common artifacts like occlusion and motion blur. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach mitigates the impact of such challenges on generation quality."

For each animation, we use the first 36 frames if the sequence exceeds that length. Following TRELLIS, our pipeline consists of four models: the 4D Structure VAE, 4D Flow Transformer, 4D Sparse VAE, and 4D Sparse Flow Transformer. Among these, the 4D Structure VAE is frozen during training, as it achieves near-perfect reconstruction of the 4D structure sequence. The remaining three models are fine-tuned. Training is performed on 8A800 GPUs using the AdamW optimizer with learning rate of 1e4 and FP16 mixed precision. The batch size is set to 2 per GPU for the generator and 1 per GPU for the VAE. Training takes approximately 7 to 8 days in total. For the progressive learning strategy, we start with 8-frame sequences and gradually increase the sequence length to 16 and then 32 frames as training progresses. Datasets. We evaluate our method on two synthetic datasets: ObjaverseDy [Xie et al. 2024] and Consistent4D [Jiang et al. 2024]. For each object in these datasets, we uniformly sample 32 camera viewpoints and render up to 32 frames per object at resolution of 512 512. Additionally, we render front-view video per object to serve as input across all methods. To assess robustness and generalization to real-world scenarios, we also incorporate video sequences from DAVIS [Caelles et al. 2019] for test. Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate image quality, we compute Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) [Wang et al. 2004] between generated novel views and corresponding ground truth. We also report LPIPS [Zhang et al. 2018] and CLIP Similarity (CLIP-S) to assess perceptual and semantic similarity. Since our method focuses on object-centric generation, we crop all images using the ground truth bounding box to mitigate the influence of background ratio on metrics. For evaluating spacetime consistency of generated 4D data, we compute Frechet Video Distance (FVD) [Unterthiner et al. 2018] on novel view videos. 1https://www.blender.org/ SS4D: Native 4D Generative Model via Structured Spacetime Latents 243:5 Table 1.

We employed the Average User Ranking (AUR) metric to evaluate model performance. The users were asked to rate the 4D generations on scale of 1 to 5, and we report the average user rating in Table 3. Our model outperformed the baselines in all three aspects with large margin. STAG4D generally receives the weakest rating for its blurry generations and over-saturated texture. The rest of the methods receive similar scores, with L4GM slightly better in shape quality and motion coherence, and DG4D better in texture quality."

Masking Augmentation enhances the models robustness to occlusions and improves overall geometry quality. without temporal alignment, the reconstructed sequence exhibits noticeable temporal flickering (e.g., the pattern on the dress), whereas incorporating temporal alignment leads to more coherent and stable textures across frames. Following the approach in [Yang et al. 2024b], we evaluate two variants using PSNR, FVD and flickering metric that quantifies video flickers by calculating L1 difference between adjacent frames. As reported in Table 5, temporal alignment significantly reduces flickering and improves the quality of reconstructed 4D assets. Masking Augmentation. As illustrated in Figure 7, the front leg of the rhino is occluded by rocks and the model without masking augmentation fails to reconstruct the occluded region, resulting in an incomplete front leg. In contrast, applying masking augmentation enables the model to infer and generate the complete shape. Table 6. Ablation of Feature Aggregation Methods.

Averaging all features (as done in TRELLIS) may introduce noise, since occluded voxels can be affected by unrelated views. rigorous ablation study would require retraining from scratch, which exceeds our computational resources. Instead, we fine-tune 4D Sparse VAE for 5k steps using visibility-aware aggregation and evaluate reconstruction quality on the ObjaverseDy dataset. As shown in Table 6, our method achieves comparable reconstruction quality while reducing sequence length and increasing encoding speed (objects/sec), resulting in more efficient training and inference."

            "title": "6 Conclusions",
            "content": "We present SS4D, native 4D generation framework capable of producing high-quality 4D assets from single monocular video. At its core lies structured spacetime latent space, seamlessly extended from pre-trained 3D prior. By temporally aligning the 3D generator and autoencoder, our method ensures spatio-temporal consistency. ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 44, No. 6, Article 243. Publication date: December 2025. Fig. 8. Failure Cases. Our method exhibits limitations in handling transparent layers, high-frequency details, and rapid motion. To address redundancy across time, we leverage factorized 4D convolutions for effective temporal compression. tailored training strategy further enhances robustness under real-world conditions. Extensive experiments show that SS4D significantly outperforms existing baselines. We hope this work contributes to the ongoing progress in 4D generation by introducing native model learned directly from spacetime data. Limitation and Future Work. While our method achieves strong performance in 4D generation, it still exhibits several limitations. First, it adopts two-stage pipeline inherited from TRELLIS, which results in less efficient training compared to fully end-to-end approaches. Second, as the model is trained primarily on synthetic data, it struggles to generate photo-realistic appearances when applied to real-world inputs, often producing over-simplified textures. Incorporating real-world video data during training could help bridge this gap and improve generalization. In addition to these structural limitations, our model also exhibits performance degradation in several practical scenarios, as illustrated in Figure 8: (a) Transparent layers: The model retains only the outermost voxels and discards internal ones, making it incapable of accurately reconstructing or generating transparent or multi-layered objects. For example, in the crystal ball case, the model produces overly blurred textures due to its inability to capture complex light refraction through multiple transparent surfaces. (b) High-Frequency Details: Despite employing temporal alignment, maintaining consistency in high-frequency details remains challenging. For instance, our model fails to preserve the fine patterns in camouflage pants, resulting in noticeable flickering. Introducing pixel-space losses may help retain finer details more effectively. (c) Rapid Movement: Scenarios involving fast motion and strong motion blur are particularly difficult. In the dog example, the model fails to reconstruct the correct shape under rapid movement. Ethical Issues. As with other generative models, our approach may inherit ethical and diversity-related biases from Objaverse and ObjaverseXL. Additionally, there are potential risks of misuse, particularly in generating deceptive or misleading content. Acknowledgement.
