            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "The study of human behavior aims to understand how individuals and groups act in various social contexts and serves as cornerstone of social science research. Traditionally, this has been accomplished using methods such as surveys, interviews, and observations [10, 18, 44]. However, these approaches often encounter challenges, including high costs, limited sample sizes, and ethical concerns. As result, researchers have resorted to alternative methods for studying human behavior. Social simulation has emerged as an effective method for addressing this issue, where researchers use agents to model human behavior, observe their reactions, and translate these findings into insights about human behavior [48, 50]. By assigning behavioral rules to autonomous agents, researchers can explore how micro-level decisions lead to emergent macro-level patterns through the agent-based models [11, 21]. This approach enables capturing specific groups preferences on particular topics and forecasting potential social dynamics. Furthermore, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced agents reasoning and decision-making capabilities, enabling them to operate and interact within increasingly realistic and complex environments [3, 35, 37]. Recent studies have explored social simulation across various levels and scenarios, from mimicking well-known individuals and mirroring specific situations to modeling large-scale social dynamics [4, 29, 34, 36, 49, 60]. However, they share common challenge: alignment between the simulated environment and the real world, which manifests across multiple dimensions and raises several key questions that remain to be addressed, as shown in Figure 1. Q1. How to align the simulated environment with the real world? In the real world, new events occur every day and new content is continuously generated. The behavior of real users is rooted in these ever-evolving social contexts and policy agendas. However, the static knowledge of LLMs prevents them from aligning with the dynamic nature of the real-world social environment [2, 15]. There is gap between the simulated context and the real world, which results in discrepancies between the simulation process and outcomes compared to those in reality. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an update mechanism to keep the simulated environment synchronized with the real world. Q2. How to align simulated agents with target users precisely? The composition of users in the real world is both complex and diverse, making it impractical to enumerate all users in every scenario. Therefore, it is essential to identify target users whose distribution aligns with that of the users in the corresponding scenario, thereby accurately reflecting the real-world composition and relationships [17, 45]. Based on this, precise target user simulation also requires providing agents with detailed and comprehensive description of the corresponding users, often involving the integration of high-fidelity demographic, contextual, and behavioral data. Q3. How to align the interaction mechanism with the real world among different scenarios? The diversity of social interactions presents challenges in social simulation design, requiring deliberate choices regarding the number of individuals, social structures, interaction patterns, and message dissemination mechanisms, to align with the real world. This often results in independently constructed task-specific simulation pipelines performing repetitive work, which reduces their generalizability and scalability [26, 58]. Therefore, there is need for unified simulation frameworks based on systematic categorization to standardize simulation components and facilitate extensibility across different social scenarios. Q4. How to align the behavioral pattern with the real-world groups? When the environment perceived by agents, the user composition, and the interaction mechanisms are aligned with the real world, agents are expected to exhibit responses consistent with those of the corresponding real users. However, current LLMs exhibit inherent bias and limitations in such reasoning, failing to infer different types of user behaviors [16, 60]. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically collect behavior-driving factors across different user characteristics and adopt appropriate modeling approaches to effectively capture diverse behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose SocioVerse, world model for social simulation driven by LLM-based agents based on large-scale real-world user pool. As shown in Figure 2, we design modular components to address the above questions. The Social Environment injects up-to-date and external real-world information into the simulation. The User Engine and Scenario Engine respectively reconstruct realistic user context and orchestrate the simulation process to align the simulation with 2 Figure 2: An illustration of SocioVerse framework invovling 4 powerful parts. The social environment provides an updated context for the simulation. During the simulation, the behavior engine takes the simulation setting, user profiles, and social information from the scenario engine, user engine, and social environment, respectively, and generates the results according to the query. the real world. Given this rich contextual setup, the Behavior Engine then drives agents to reproduce human behaviors accordingly. To support the framework, we construct user pool of 10 million individuals by collecting real-world social media data to power the user engine. Comparable in scale to the entire populations of Hungary or Greece, this extensive pool enables diverse and large-scale social simulations. For any customized simulation task, various sampling strategies can be applied to extract target user groups from the pool to support the simulation process. We conduct three simulations using the SocioVerse framework, each differing in research domain, user composition, and social environment: (a) presidential election prediction, (b) breaking news feedback, and (c) national economic survey. For each task, we compare the simulation results with real-world situations. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework serves as robust foundation for building standardized and accurate large-scale social simulations. In summary, our key contributions are as follows: SocioVerse: We propose world model for social simulation comprising four powerful alignment modules, enabling diverse and trustworthy social simulations (as illustrated in Figure 2). 10M User Pool: user pool of 10 million individuals, constructed from real-world behavioral data, enables large-scale and diverse social simulations, ranging from small interest groups to large citizen communities. Three Illustrative Simulations: We demonstrate the frameworks capabilities through three distinct scenarios: presidential election prediction, breaking news feedback, and national economic survey, providing foundation for future research."

            "title": "2 Methods",
            "content": "Overall Framework The SocioVerse framework follows structured pipeline to achieve realistic social simulation results, as shown in Figure 2: (1) Social Environment collects updated information and contextual knowledge. Within the simulation environment, (2) User Engine aligns the simulated agents with target users, (3) Scenario Engine aligns the interaction structure with diverse scenarios, and (4) Behavior Engine aligns the behavioral pattern with real-world target groups. 2.1 Social Environment Function The social environment provides event-related context to align the simulation environment with real-world conditions. By integrating up-to-date events, social statistics, and preference content into LLM-based agents, it enhances the realism of the simulation and improve agent decision-making. Components The social environment should encompass as much real-world social, cultural, and technological context as possible. It can be broadly categorized into three types: social structural information, social dynamic information, and personalized context. Social Structure: Social structural information provides agents with rich knowledge base encompassing demographic distributions, cultural norms, urban infrastructures, and collective behavior patterns [57]. This data allows agents to behave in way that aligns with the typical characteristics of their assigned demographic or geographic profile. For example, by incorporating regional dialect preferences, work-life habits, and common social values, the simulation can more accurately reflect public discourse trends, mobility behaviors, and economic interactions. Social Dynamics: Social dynamics encompass time-sensitive content continuously generated in the real world, such as news events and policy changes. Typically, this engine maintains an up-to-date event base to continuously collect real-world event news from mainstream news, and all the news articles contain time stamps and event-related tags so that LLM-based agents can comb through the timeline of the events and react accordingly [37]. Personalized Context: In addition to the macro social environment, individuals also receive different personalized information feeds. Previous studies have explored that the recommendation system can enhance the behavior diversity of the agent [31, 56, 60]. Consequently, the preference content component constructs relevant posts and pushes them to agents according to their social interaction network and interesting topics. 2.2 User Engine Function The user engine aligns simulated agents with rich set of real-world user samples, enabling the creation of complex target users within the simulation. Components To support diverse user composition and effective user retrieval and description, the user engine incorporates large user pool and wide range of user labels. User Pools: The user pool is designed to collect extensive digital footprints of individuals across social media platforms, enabling more comprehensive characterization of real-world behavioral patterns and expression tendencies. To this end, we constructed user pool covering variety of social media platforms, including X1 and Rednote2. Anomalous data, such as advertising and bot-generated content, is filtered by calculating the post frequency and average text similarity. The detailed procedure can be found in Appendix A. We index users and construct user pool of 10 million users based on the collected social media posts. Formally, we define user pool as: serP ool = {Ui, Pi S}, where the i-th user Ui derives from the collection of social media platforms with his/her related posts Pi = {Pi,1, Pi,2, ...}. The statistical summary of the user pool is provided in Table 1. 1https://x.com/ 2https://www.xiaohongshu.com/"

User Labels: User labels refer to the tagging and description of users, which can be represented using discrete attributes or continuous representation. Demographic descriptions of users are the most commonly used form of labeling. However, they are often not directly accessible. Therefore, we designed demographic annotation system to infer and label user attributes. The process begins with multiple LLMs serving as initial annotators, classifying users across various demographic dimensions. Human annotators then evaluate and refine the LLM-generated labels, ensuring the reliability of the user tags dataset. The curated dataset is subsequently used to train demographic classifiers, enabling large-scale annotation in cost-effective manner. Specifically, we annotate users across 15 demographic dimensions: age, gender, vocation, race, income, education, settlement type, region, employment, marital status, religious, party, ideology, BigFive personality, and hobbies. Each attribute is inferred by specialized classifier trained on the corresponding subset of the user tags dataset. See Appendix for further details. 2.3 Scenario Engine Function The scenario engine aligns various simulation structures with real-world contexts based on specific task formulations and scenario types, and then scales individual simulations by sampling according to demographic distributions provided by the user engine. Components The scenario engine formulates wide range of real-world social situations, which can be summarized as archetypal scenario templates, including questionnaires, in-depth interviews, behavior experiments, and social media interaction. Questionnaire: The questionnaire scenario constructs the simulation in 1-to-N manner, with one designed scale or questionnaire answered by multiple target users in single round. This scenario is suitable for massive social investigation on specific topics, like election polls. Indepth Interview: The in-depth interview scenario follows 1-to-1 structure, where simulated interviewer engages with an individual target user through multiple interaction rounds [43]. This iterative process allows for probing deeper into responses, clarifying ambiguities, and exploring underlying motivations. Such simulations are particularly useful for qualitative research on user experiences, psychological assessments, and exploratory studies where nuanced responses and detailed reasoning are essential. Behavior Experiment: The behavior experiment scenario is typically conducted in 1-to-N or N-to-N format, depending on whether individual or group interactions are being studied [8, 42]. Simulated users are exposed to controlled conditions where their behavioral responses are observed across multiple rounds of interaction. These simulations help researchers examine decision-making processes, social influences, and cognitive biases in various experimental setups, such as consumer behavior studies or cooperative game simulations. Social Media Interaction: The social media interaction scenario adopts an N-to-N structure, where multiple simulated users engage in dynamic, multi-round exchanges in an online setting [30]. This scenario captures real-time interactions, including content sharing, comment threads, and viral spread dynamics, allowing researchers to analyze public discourse, opinion shifts, and information diffusion It is particularly valuable for studying trends in misinformation, political on social platforms. discussions, and network-based influence propagation. 2.4 Behavior Engine Function The behavior engine aims to align the behaviors of the agents with that of real users. The behavior engine integrates user history and experience from the user engine, the interaction mechanism from the scenario engine and social context from the social environment to predict the behavior of each individual. 5 Components To achieve credible behavior simulation, the behavior engine needs to provide robust simulation foundation, including traditional agent-based models and series of LLMs. Traditional Agent-Based Modeling: Traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) relies on rule-based and mathematical models [9, 23, 32, 47, 52], where interactions among agents are typically realized through the broadcasting of predefined values. These values are derived from heuristic functions or theoretical mathematical formulations. Traditional ABM approaches are highly scalable and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for simulating large populations, especially marginal users with relatively limited influence. LLM-powered Agents: LLMs leverage their role-playing capabilities to simulate user-generated content, and the abilities can be activated through various methods [29, 36, 51, 6164]. Specifically, the behavior engine can be powered by general LLMs, expert LLMs, and domain-specific LLMs. Through non-parametric prompting, powerful general LLMs (e.g., GPT series and Qwen series) can act in accordance with predefined user profiles. Expert and domain-specific LLMs are acquired through parametric training, e.g., continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. When target users exhibit complex profiles and the simulation requires deep domain expertise, these models are leveraged to enhance the professionalism and accuracy of agent behaviors."

            "title": "Implementation of Specific Scenarios",
            "content": "We implement three representative social simulation scenarios through the SocioVerse framework based on the implemented components: (a) presidential election prediction of America, (b) breaking news feedback analysis, and (c) national economic survey of China. These scenarios respectively address political communication, journalistic dissemination, and socioeconomic domains, demonstrating the frameworks generalizability through standardized implementation pipelines. Figure 3: Illustration of three scenarios representing (a) presidential election prediction, (b) breaking news feedback, and (c) national economic survey. 3.1 Presidential Election Prediction of America Task Description Presidential elections remain central to public engagement and party strategy formation [6, 46]. This study analyzes methods for large-scale election simulation using LLMs through the U.S. presidential systems Electoral College framework. In this indirect voting system, citizens vote for state electors (allocated by congressional representation) who formally elect the president. Most states employ winner-takes-all allocation of electoral votes to the statewide majority winner, with our modeling focused on predicting these state-level outcomes. Target Group Distribution Extensive research has documented the influence of demographic factors on election outcomes [33, 53]. We model U.S. demographic and ideological diversity through integrated Census Bureau (2022 voting/registration) and ANES (2020) data [1]. This scenario incorporates 12 attributes from the user engine: socioeconomic (income, education, employment), geographic (region, area), and political (party, ideology) dimensions alongside demographic factors (age, gender, race, marital status, and religious status). Given available marginal distributions, we employ iterative proportional fitting (IPF) to synthesize agent populations, see Appendix C.1. Questionnaire Design We design the presidential election questionnaire based on abundant polls conducted by various media and research institutes [5, 24], incorporating both significant issues and 6 voter preferences. These elements are then optimized into proper forms for LLM-based agents by the scenario engine. The entire questionnaire can be found in Appendix D.1. Evaluation Metric Two metrics are used to comprehensively compare the simulated election results to the real-world results. (1) Accuracy rate (Acc) is measured by calculating the proportion of states for which the election simulation results align with the actual result, serving as coarse-grained evaluation metric. (2) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is measured by calculating the simulated vote share and the actual vote share for each state, which serves as fine-grained evaluation metric. 3.2 Breaking News Feedback Task Description Journalism plays crucial role in shaping public perception and opinion through agenda-setting, framing, and information dissemination [20, 55]. Online social media platforms have gradually replaced the influence of traditional paper media. When breaking news is released on social media platforms, its potential audience may hold different stances. We take the release of ChatGPT as our target news to evaluate the accuracy and foreseeability of public attitudes. Target Group Distribution We define all Rednote users in our pool as the universal set, identifying technology-interested users as the potential audience set P, and those discussing ChatGPT via keyword matching as the ground truth set G, with serP ool. Context is limited to pre-news timeframes to prevent leakage. Using the potential audience distribution as prior, we sample agents with identical distribution sampling (IDS) as Ds = IDS(U serP ool, P), see Appendix C.2), considering demographics (gender, age, education, and consumption level) during sampling the user pools. Based on this, the task is to compare the consistency between the agents attitudes toward news and those of the users in the ground truth set. Questionnaire Design We design the cognitive questionnaire using the ABC attitude model (Affect, Behavior, Cognition) [28], which outlines attitude formation as hierarchy: cognition affects emotions, guiding behavior. Combined with 5-point Likert scale [22], the questionnaire covers six dimensions: public cognition (PC), perceived risks (PR), perceived benefits (PB), trust (TR), fairness (FA), and public acceptance (PA). See Appendix D.2 for details. Evaluation Metric Agents from both sets answer the questionnaire for paired responses. Two evaluation dimensions assess feedback: (1) Normalized RMSE (NRMSE) measures point-wise differences between simulated and ground truth answers across PC, PR, PB, TR, FA, and PA as value evaluations; (2) KL-divergence (KL-Div) compares the 6-dimensional answer distributions between groups as consistency evaluations. 3.3 National Economic Survey of China Task Description Economic simulation is another crucial part of massive social simulations as it models resource distribution, market dynamics, and financial behaviors, providing insights into economic stability and policy impacts [13, 54]. By integrating economic factors with social interactions, it enhances the prediction of systemic outcomes, guiding decision-making in areas such as governance, urban planning, and crisis management. We follow national economic survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, which interviews Chinese citizens on their monthly spending given the average salary of each province in China. Target Group Distribution The prior distribution is based on the methodology from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, which takes 160,000 families nationwide and calculates their incomes and spending as the national average statistics [39]. We sample nationwide agents from our user pool proportionally according to their region population and generate their income distribution according to the regional average income [38]. The detailed method can be referred to in Appendix C.3. Questionnaire Design Spending details in China Statistical Yearbook 2024 [40] are categorized into eight parts, i.e. food, clothing, housing, daily necessities & services, communication & transportation, education & entertainment, healthcare, and others. Consequently, the questionnaire design covers the above categories with examples and uses segmented interval options in each question. The entire questionnaire can be referred to in Appendix D.3. 7 Evaluation Metric Both value evaluation and distribution evaluation are involved in the national economic survey as well. (1) NRMSE of the nine categories is measured between the simulated results and official statistics. (2) KL-Div is measured by taking the 8-item spending as distribution to evaluate the consistency between the simulation and the real world."

IPF and IDS denote iterative proportional fitting and identical distribution sampling, see Appendix C. Experiment Settings We select powerful LLMs from different model families. For open-sourced models, we select Llama-3-70b-Instruct [14], Qwen2.5-72b-Instruct [59], DeepSeek-R1-671b [19], and DeepSeek-V3 [27]. For commercial models, we select GPT-4o3 [41] and GPT-4o-mini4. We compare the settings of all three scenarios for better understanding, which is shown in Table 2. As the Presidential Election Prediction covers 1-in-1,000 sample of the U.S. population, GPT-4o is excluded from comparison due to cost constraints. In terms of local model serving, Qwen2.572b-Instruct and Llama3-70b-Instruct models are both deployed on 8 NVIDIA RTX4090 GPUs via vLLM [25]. We set max tokens to 2,048 for all models to enable chain-of-thoughts during the generation and the temperature is set to 0.7 to encourage diversity.

Results The overall simulation results of the three scenarios are shown in Table 3. We also report subset results for presidential election prediction and national economic survey. Presidential Election Prediction We report the overall results and the battleground states results separately. The prediction of battleground states is challenging even in the real world and thus becomes the focus during the election process. According to the results, GPT-4o-mini and Qwen2.5-72b show competitive performance both in Acc and RMSE. Typically, according to the winner-takes-all rule, over 90% state voting results are predicted correctly, which means the simulation achieves high-precision macroscopic reduction of the real-world election results. After the case study, we find that DeepSeek-R1-671b sometimes falls into overthinking, resulting in less accurate results. 3gpt-4o-2024-08-06 4gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 8 Breaking News Feedback The results measure the overall consistency of each model compared with the real-world users reactions and attitudes. To this end, the performances of GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-72b are more aligned with real-world perspectives than other models in terms of KL-Div and NRMSE, respectively, and the following detailed analysis will demonstrate that the models consistently capture and accurately predict public trends and opinions. National Economic Survey We report the overall results and results for the top 10 regions by GDP (i.e., developed regions) separately. Generally, all the models closely align with real-world statistics. Llama3-70b shows significant superiority over other models in the economic survey scenario and all the models perform better in the 1st-Region subset than overall. The results demonstrate that individuals spending habits can be accurately reproduced under the SocioVerse framework, especially in developed regions. The overall results from both value evaluation and distribution evaluation of three simulations sufficiently prove that SocioVerse can support diverse and accurate massive social simulations with standard pipeline and minimal changes with human experts in the loop. However, the choice of underlying LLMs can affect simulation precision across different scenarios, highlighting the need for further study. 4.2 Prior Distribution and Real-World Knowledge Can Enhance Simulation Accuracy in Presidential Election Predictions Model Acc RMSE Llama3-70b - w/o Knowledge - w/o Knowledge & Piror Distribution Qwen2.5-72b - w/o Knowledge - w/o Knowledge & Piror Distribution GPT-4o-mini - w/o Knowledge - w/o Knowledge & Piror Distribution 0.733 0.533 0.600 0.800 0.800 0.600 0.800 0.800 0.667 0.045 0.051 0. 0.031 0.033 0.370 0.039 0.052 0.323 Table 4: Ablation experiment results on the presidential election prediction simulation, where -w/o Knowledge denotes without real-world user knowledge and -w/o Piror Distribution denotes using random demographics distribution. We conduct an ablation study on the presidential election prediction simulation to assess the impact of prior demographics distribution and real-world user knowledge. As shown in Table 4, prior demographics distribution significantly improves the accuracy of the simulation in both Acc and RMSE compared to random demographics distribution. Additionally, past posts from users on social media platforms improve the fine-grained performance, especially for Llama3-70b in Acc and all the models in RMSE. We can tell from the ablation study that both prior distribution and real-world knowledge in the SocioVerse pipeline are significant during the simulation. 4.3 Group Preference and Perspectives Can Be Well Reflected in Breaking News Feedback During the Breaking News Feedback simulation, the core concern is whether the preferences and perspectives of the target group are well captured and reflected in the results. We reformulate the original questionnaire into the Likert 6-dimension scale ranging from 1 to 5 points, representing from totally disagree to totally agree. As the ground truth of the simulation is calculated by prompting LLM agents from the ground truth set, the simulated and real results are paired for each model, as shown in Figure 4. All the models powered by the potential audience set during the simulation tend to behave consistently with the ground truth users. However, Llama3-70b perform poorly with larger gap between the simuated and real results than other models. GPT-4o-mini shows different attitudes in the fairness (FA) and public acceptance (PA) dimensions, which may be because the news is related to OpenAI. Another trend indicates that, generally, all the models perform more 9 Figure 4: An illustration of the performances of the breaking news feedback simulation, where PC, PR, PB, TR, FA, and PA denote six dimensions from the Likert scale (see 3.2 questionnaire design), with 1-point standing for totally disagree and 5-point for totally agree. conservatively in the simulated results than the real results, which also underlines the potential risk of biases during the public opinion simulation. 4.4 The Capabilities of LLMs Vary in Different Domains in National Economic Survey Item Llama3-70b Qwen2.5-72b GPT-4o-mini GPT-4o DeepSeek-R Daily Clothing Transportation_Communication Education_Entertainment Medical Food Household Others 0.007 0.012 0.016 0.018 0.023 0.037 0.052 0.008 0.009 0.015 0.020 0.022 0.062 0.031 0.110 0. 0.006 0.019 0.027 0.024 0.041 0.031 0.107 0.010 0.010 0.015 0.023 0.017 0.057 0.040 0.120 0.005 0.009 0.015 0.017 0.022 0.060 0.032 0.102 0.

The best results are bolded; the second-best results are underlined. The simulation of the national economic survey covers 8 spending dimensions. The overall results in Table 3 show the average performance of these dimensions, while model performances among these dimensions can also vary. We calculate the averaged NRMSE of 31 regions on each spending level, as shown in Table 5. It is worth mentioning that all the models show high consistency. Eliminating the others item, all the models perform best on daily necessities spending planning and worst on housing spending, which can reveal the LLMs preference on the economic decision-making and highlight the challenge in housing spending strategy."

            "content": "In this study, we introduce generalized social simulation framework SocioVerse and evaluated its performance across three distinct real-world scenarios. Our findings indicate that state-of-theart LLMs demonstrate notable ability to simulate human responses in complex social contexts, although some gaps still remain between the simulated response and observed real-world outcomes. Therefore, future research may need to incorporate broader range of scenarios and develop more fine-grained evaluations built upon the current analytic engine, to further explore and expand the boundaries of LLMs simulation capabilities. Such efforts could pave the way for establishing LLMs as comprehensive and reliable tools for large-scale social simulation. We observed several key patterns across the simulations of the scenarios. First, incorporating demographic distributions and users historical experiences significantly improved simulation accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of building large, demographically rich user pool, complemented by multi-dimensional user tagging system for more precise modeling of group-specific behaviors. Second, under consistent measurement protocols, LLMs produced broadly similar simulations of human attitudes and ideologies. However, certain models, such as GPT-4o-mini, showed notable inconsistencies, indicating that model-specific preferences or biases remain influential and warrant closer scrutiny in future work. Finally, we found that while LLMs perform well in simple daily 10 scenarios, they underperform in complex situations requiring contextual knowledge, underscoring the need to align model behavior with real-world experiences and social contexts. Notably, the current version has only implemented part of our framework, indicating significant potential for enhancing the accuracy and quality of social simulations. Future work can focus on refining each module for better collaboration, enabling the framework to achieve its full potential. For instance, the incorporation of the social environment can inject up-to-date knowledge into LLMs, enhancing the understanding of social dynamics. The scenario engine can not only provide surveybased simulation but also expand to diverse formats such as social interviews and free interactions. Additionally, further optimization of the general LLMs and expert LLMs adaptation in the behavior engine will enable better accommodation of complex target user groups, such as minority groups and individuals with special disabilities. The analysis engine can introduce an autonomous planning module to improve the overall credibility of simulation results. Beyond the social simulation framework, our work underscores the potential to bridge the gap between autonomous AI systems and traditional social science, offering social scientists seamless, cost-effective tool for conducting social experiments with minimal setup. Such tools not only help analyze and validate psychological and sociological theories or hypotheses, such as behavioral economics and social identity theory, but also assist in predicting large-scale social impacts like policy changes, social movements, or public health crises. By providing an efficient and scalable simulation environment, our framework is not just research tool, but an experimental platform for exploring the dynamic changes and long-term trends of virtual societies, with the aim of becoming realistic mapping for real-world societies."

            "content": "C.1 Iterative Proportional Fitting In our study, we follow the classical IPF method to construct the joint distribution of all the attributes in our simulation. Specifically, we start with two-way table with individual components denoted as xij and targeted estimation ˆxij. The targeted estimation ˆxij satisfies Σj ˆxij = vi and Σi ˆxij = wj. The iterations are specified as follows: Let ˆx(0) ij = xij. For α > 1: ˆx(2α1) ij = ˆx(2α2) vi ij k=1 ˆx(2α2) ΣJ ij ˆx(2α1) wj ij k=1 ˆx(2α1) ΣI ij ˆx(2α) ij = (1) (2) The iterations end when the estimated marginals are sufficiently close to the real marginals or when they stabilize without further convergence. For the presidential election simulation, we implement the IPF algorithm for each state using five attributes: gender, race, age group, ideology, and partisanship. In most cases, the algorithm does not converge, but the gaps between the estimated and actual marginals are less than 5%, with 888 out of 918 marginals falling within this range. For the outliers, since IPF adjusts proportionally to the marginals, the overall ratio of marginals remains consistent. We then use the estimated joint distribution and marginals for our massive simulation. C.2 Identical Distribution Sampling Identical distribution sampling, also known as direct sampling, is applied when the joint distribution of multiple demographics is available. Given feature and , the joint distribution can be formulated as p(X, ). Then, identical distribution sampling can be formulated as follows: (Xi, Yi) p(X, ) = 1, 2, ..., (3) For breaking news feedback simulations, as the ground truth set is directly from the Rednote, we can obtain all the users demographics and calculate the joint distribution. Simultaneously, the scale of the user pool satisfies the direct sampling requirements. C.3 Prior Distribution of National Economic Survey For the national economic survey distribution, only average income is available from the official data. As result, we generate the prior income distribution at the regional level. The income distribution across different regions exhibits significant heterogeneity, often characterized by right-skewed pattern. To model this distribution, we adopt mixture distribution approach, combining lognormal distribution for the majority of the population with Pareto distribution for the high-income segment. This hybrid model captures both the bulk of wage earners and the long-tail effect observed in high-income groups. Formally, let denote an individuals wage. We assume that for the lower and middle-income groups (X < xmin), incomes follow log-normal distribution: log Normal (cid:0)µ, σ2(cid:1) where (cid:32) µ = ln µ2 (cid:112)σ actual actual + µ2 actual (cid:33) (cid:115) (cid:18) , σ = ln 1 + (cid:19) σ2 µ2 actual actual For the high-income group (X xmin), wages follow Pareto distribution: (X x) = Cxα, xmin 18 (4) (5) (6) where α is the Pareto shape parameter determining the income concentration at the top. The proportion of individuals assigned to each distribution is governed by an empirical threshold ratio, typically set such that 90% of the population follows the log-normal distribution while 10% follows the Pareto distribution. This mixture approach provides flexible yet robust framework for simulating realistic income distributions across diverse economic conditions. We set all the parameters empirically according to previous research and generate the income distribution for 31 regions in China (Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are excluded)."
