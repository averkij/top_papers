            "content": "Advances in OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 style models (Jaech et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) with long reasoning chains (Wei et al., 2023) have significantly enhanced the models capability *Equal contribution. Project leader of student team. Corresponding author 1The code and data of this work is available at https://github.com/toward-agi/diverse-o1.git. Figure 1: subjective reasoning task example which demonstrates that the perpective shifts may lead to different answers. We illustrate that diverse perspective thinking benefits subjective question answering. in various reasoning tasks (Yu et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2024b). Extended reasoning chains enable models to systematically divide and conquer complex problems, iteratively refining intermediate results, and methodically verifying the outputs. The DeepSeek R1 style models reached performance comparable to human experts in many objective reasoning tasks such as math (Cobbe et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2025a; Guo et al., 2025) and coding (Jain et al., 2024). This success highlights that scaling up the test time computation can significantly boost performance on complex, structured tasks relative to standard single-step prompting (Jaech et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023). Beyond objective tasks with single correct answer, there is growing interest in applying Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to subjective or openended problems (Sarıtas et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2024). This homogenization stems from standard training pipelines which reduce subjective problems to single ground truth for both supervised learning and reinforcement learning, thereby penalizing diverse perspectives. As illustrated in Figure 1, due to the single inherent thinking process of LRM, the model tends to rely on homogeneous reasoning trajectories without exploring alternative perspectives, hindering their capacity to incorporate diverse reasoning strategies. Prior works solutions mainly fall into two categories: (1) Research on multi-agent debates has demonstrated that incorporating diverse role perspectives substantially improves performance on subjective tasks (Aoyagui et al., 2025; Cheng et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025b), but these methods require multiple interacting models; (2) some approaches ensemble solutions from varied decoding paths (Wang et al., 2023), yet the stochastic nature of these paths may not necessarily introduce broader range of perspectives (Naik et al., 2024). To address this gap, we propose to enhance the diversity of the DeepSeek R1 style reasoning chain, by dynamically integrating diverse role perspectives for subjective question answering, including tasks such as moral dilemmas, opinion-based questions, ambiguous question answering, and so on. To begin with, we conduct pilot study to confirm two key factors: the effectiveness of long reasoning chains in subjective reasoning tasks, and the impact of varying the number of role perspectives incorporated during reasoning. Our findings show that sequential test-time scaling performance improves as reasoning chains are lengthened, but begins to decline once they surpass an optimal length. Similarly, we identify that there exists an optimal range for the number of role perspectives in the reasoning chain. Building upon these insights, we propose novel framework MultiRole-R1 that enhances the diversity of long chains of thought. Specifically, we optimize the role perspective diversity and the reasoning diversity. MultiRole-R1 starts with novel data construction pipeline combining parallel scaling with sequential scaling to effectively incorporate broader array of role perspectives into the long reasoning chains. We subsequently refine the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), instructing the model to learn the multi-role reasoning format and enhance perspective diversity. Furthermore, to enhance the diversity of the reasoning process, we introduce carefully designed diversity reward function implemented through multi-role Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, taking diversity as an additional reward signal. By training on subjective questions only, MultiRoleR1 boosts the performance of both subjective and objective reasoning tasks. Our contribution can be summarized as follows: We perform pilot analysis that reveals the scaling law of reasoning length and role perspectives in subjective reasoning. We propose MultiRole-R1, training paradigm that incorporates unsupervised SFT data generation and GRPO with reward shaping, which effectively promotes perspective and lexical diversity. By training on subjective questions solely, MultiRole-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective reasoning benchmarks. Our experiments and analysis highlight an interesting phenomenon: optimizing for diversity often aligns with, and can even enhance, the accuracy objective. This synergistic relationship underscores our methods effectiveness and its robust generalizability to other domains."

            "content": "Test-Time Scaling Recent advancements, such as the success of Deepseek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) in demonstrating robust long-chainof-thought (CoT) reasoning, have brought significant attention to test-time scaling (Wang et al., 2025c; Liu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025b). Current approaches to test-time scaling can be broadly classified into four categories (Zhang et al., 2025). Sequential scaling, as explored by Madaan et al. (2023) and Xiang et al. (2025), iteratively refines models state and output, with each step building on the previous to form coherent chain of computations. In contrast, parallel scaling (Wu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024a) leverage parallelism to expand the coverage of reasoning chain, thereby increasing the likelihood of identifying correct solutions. Additionally, hybrid scaling, as proposed in Wang et al. (2024b) and Zhang et al. (2024), combines parallel generation of diverse options with sequential evaluation and refinement to enhance reasoning capabilities. Finally, internal scaling (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025) empowers models to autonomously allocate computational resources during inference, moving away from reliance on externally guided strategies. While these approaches have demonstrated impressive performance improvements, they primarily focus on enhancing models reasoning capabilities in mathematical or coding tasks which contain fixed and verifiable answers. Such methods largely overlook the importance of promoting diversity in reasoning for open-ended questions, which require consideration from multiple perspectives. Subjective Tasks and LLM Role-Playing Subjective task is type of task that differs from objective tasks, such as commonsense reasoning, code generation and arithmetic reasoning (Wang et al., 2025b) -which involve questions with definitive correct or incorrect answers. Subjective task, due to its open-ended nature, has answers that may change with perspective-shifts or context change (Wang et al., 2025b; Jentzsch and Kersting, 2023; Wu et al., 2024a). This includes culture-related question answering (Huang and Yang, 2023; DURMUS et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025b), subjective language interpretation (Jones et al., 2025), ethical question answering (Hendrycks et al., 2021), creative question answering (Lu et al., 2024), and so on. LLM role-playing (Shao et al., 2023), including multi-role discussion (Wang et al., 2024c; Du et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024) is one of the most used techniques to study subjective task. It features specialized AI systems to simulate assigned personas, ranging from real-life figures to fictional characters (Chen et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025a). The capacity to simulate different personas has been shown to elicit human-like responses, and introduce more diverse and creative reasoning paths (Naik et al., 2024) when solving LLM-related tasks (Wang et al., 2024d). In this work, we adopt parallel multi-role reasoning at test time to enable the model think from diverse perspective via independent reasoning paths."

We employ two complementary strategies: sequential scaling to deepen reasoning through iterative reflection (Zeng et al., 2025), and parallel scaling to enhance exploration by generating multiple reasoning paths (Liu et al., 2025c; Rodionov et al., 2025). We evaluate this approach on three subjective reasoning datasets: GlobalOpinion QA (DURMUS et al., 2024), BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022), and ETHICS (Hendrycks et al., 2021) across four decoding strategies adapted from Jiang et al. (2025), with examples provided in Appendix 7: Zero think: Force the model to respond without thinking, i.e. <think></think>. Less think: Force the model to think for one sentence only <think>Okay, the user ask for this, can answer it without thinking much.</think> Regular think: Let the model start with <think> and ends its thinking naturally. More think: Starts with regular think. When the end-of-thinking is reached, forcefully replace the <think> token and append wait\" that encourages the model to think more. As shown in Figure 2 (a), increasing the amount of test-time reasoning through scaling indeed yields performance gains. We thus incorporate More think as our baseline. Scaling Law of Reasoning Length Having established the effectiveness of test-time scaling, natural follow-up question is whether longer reasoning chains always result in better performance. However, prior studies on mathematical and commonsense reasoning have shown that excessively long reasoning chains do not necessarily lead to improved outcomes (Sui et al., 2025; Ballon et al., 2025; Qin et al., 2025). Therefore, to control the reasoning length for sequential scaling leveraging concepts from budget forcing (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025a), we conduct an investigation experiment aimed at roughly estimating the optimal reasoning length specifically for subjective problems. We adhere to the experimental setup proposed by Jiang et al. (2025) and experiment on the optimal number of replacing the endof-thinking delimiter. As shown in Figure 2 (b), increasing the number of \"Wait\" tokens generally leads to performance improvements across most tasks. For GLOQA, performance continues to improve with more Wait insertions, whereas for BBQ and ETHICS, the gains peak around three insertions and diminish or even degrade beyond that point. Based on this observation, we adopt three Wait tokens as balanced setting that achieves clear performance gains without excessive computational overhead. We refer to this configuration as the More think strategy, which not only fosters Figure 2: (a) The performance of Deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) under different reasoning length settings across different datasets. The bar chart shows that longer reasoning chains result in higher accuracy on subjective tasks. (b) The performance of Deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) under different reasoning length settings across different datasets. (c) Demonstration of the number of distinct opinions increases as more roles are involved in single reasoning chain. more cautious and reflective reasoning, but also enables longer reasoning chains capable of supporting more nuanced and diverse role-based perspectives. Scaling Law of Role Perspectives We explore the relationship between the number of roles and the answer diversity and consensus accuracy on subjective QA tasks. Intuitively, each additional role contributes new viewpoint, expanding the solution space. Lu et al. (2024) shows multi-agent debates with 3 fixed roles achieve optimal creativity, but scaling different role perspectives in single reasoning chain at test time remains unexplored. We conduct pilot analysis that directly instructs the model to think from different viewpoints, with from 1 to 6. Results in Figure 2 (c) show that the number of distinct opinions increases as more roles are involved. In general, we observed that the number of distinct opinions plateaus as = 4. Hence, in the following study, we control the number of generated roles = 2, 3, 4 for efficient generation."

            "content": "Multi-Role Exploration To model multiperspective reasoning, we first identify set of context relevant roles (e.g., domain experts, stakeholders, or personas) through few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020), denoted as = {R1, R2, ..., Rn}. In particular, we prompt the model to generate roles that may have conflicting viewpoints. The motivation for this is to explore diverse available perspectives. Given candidate roles R, we define the selection probabilities: (RiQ) = sof tmax(E[M(RiQ)] +λERi[1 sim(Ri, Rj)]), (1) where sim(Ri, Rj) = cos(hRi, hRj Q) and denotes the embedding of the LLM M. These terms represent that, in the role selection process, we prioritize role answers that are relevant to the question and contrastive to the existing opinions. , (2) Ri Self-Consistency Filtering For each role Ri, we generate candidate reasoning paths M(Q, Ri) = TRi = {T (1) , ..., (k) }. This is achieved by Ri Ri adjusting the sampling temperature τ = 1 to encourage diverse reasoning paths. To ensure the coherence among different responses of each role, we then apply self-consistency filtering (Chen et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2025d) through majority voting and only keep the most consistent answer: 1(T (j) Ri ˆTRi = argmax (cid:88) (2) ), j=1,T TRi where 1 is the indicator function and denotes semantic equivalence (e.g. same roles give different answers). This approach extends ensemble methods by decoupling role-specific reasoning trajectories, ensuring that conflicting viewpoints remain independently generated and self-consistent."

            "title": "4.2 Multi-Role Finetuning",
            "content": "To enhance our models reasoning capabilities in both accuracy and diversity, we first fine-tune the Figure 3: Illustration of our MultiRole-R1framework. Stage 1: we collect our data by utilizing budget forcing (sequential scaling) and contrastive role reasoning, sampling outputs from the decoder (parallel scaling). Stage 2: we automatically construct our training data that integrates various perspectives into single reasoning chain, and then fine-tune the model to follow the multi-role reasoning format. Stage 3: we utilize GRPO with reward shaping to optimize the reasoning accuracy and diversity. Two accuracy evaluation approaches are applied, depending on whether the ground-truth varies by roles. By taking diversity as an additional reward, we encourage exploration of the reasoning chain, expanding the answer search space. base model with self-consistency filtered data. This initial stage teaches the model to adopt multi-role reasoning format, which involves shifting perspectives throughout its reasoning process. To further promote this diversity, our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset includes 968 examples specifically designed for varied role generation. Sequential Multi-Role Merging Given filtered role perspectives { ˆTR1, ..., ˆTRm}, we generate random combination of role orderings Π to avoid the effect of position bias (Zheng et al., 2023a). For example, given multi-role combination π = {Ri, Rj, Rk}, we construct the training data as follows: Dtrain = (cid:91) {(Q ˆTRi ˆTRj ˆTRk ) π}. (3) πΠ We consider two merging strategies depending on task type to allow dynamic integration of role reasoning traces while respecting the nature of the reasoning task: (1) Divergent merging: when the roles are supposed to give different answers, we encourage diverse perspectives to maximize coverage of the searching space. Final prediction is derived via weighted aggregation over differing viewpoints. (2) Convergent merging: when the roles are supposed to give consistent answers, they reach consensus via majority voting within single sequence, which is in nature soft majority voting within single sequence. Multi-Role Supervised Finetuning To ensure the quality of the SFT data, we apply several filtering strategies to the merged dataset. To mitigate verbosity bias (Zheng et al., 2023b) and reasoning shortcut behaviors, we remove entries in the top and bottom 10th percentiles of answer length. We also discard instances with formatting errors or invalid string patterns. This results in the final 2,700 SFT training data. Additionally, since the gold labels are accessible in the original dataset, we apply supervised, ground-truth-guided filtering approach as comparison to our unsupervised selfconsistency method. Results of this comparison are presented in Section 7.1."

            "content": "We adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) for Multi-Role reinforcement learning, which is trained on top of the SFT model. GRPO optimizes the policy by sampling group of candidate outputs for each prompt and comparing their reward. We incorporate two types of rewards: an accuracy reward Racc provided by verifiable reward model that checks answer correctness, and diversity reward Rdiv computed from the input text as shaping signal. The total shaped reward is given by = 0.9 Racc + 0.1 Rdiv. This follows the rewardshaping paradigm (Ng et al., 1999), where the auxiliary Rdiv guides learning without changing the optimal policy. During training, we observe synergetic effect of optimizing the diversity and accuracy objectives. This also mitigates issues observed in the SFT baseline, such as excessive verbosity and repetitive reasoning (Toshniwal et al., 2025). Finally, note that GRPO computes group advantages A1, A2, . . . , AG instead of standard reward, which is given by: ˆAi,t = (Ri,t µ)/σ, {1, . . . , G}. Hence, group with uniform rewards (all 0s or all 1s) would give zero advantage and stall learning. By adding the diversity term, we ensure intra-group reward variance, enabling informative gradients and continued optimization."

To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach, we test on three additional datasets: cultural natural language inference (CALI by Huang and Yang (2023)), commonsense reasoning (CSQA by Talmor et al.

Specifically, for the testing data, CALI consists of the out-of-domain (O.O.D.) subjective questions, while CSQA and GSM8K consist of O.O.D. objective questions.

Diversity To quantify the diversity of modelgenerated reasoning, we design composite metric that captures linguistic variation across multiple dimensions. Inspired by prior work on lexical and entropy-based diversity in natural language generation (Li et al., 2016; Tanaka-Ishii and Aihara, 2015), our metric is weighted sum of eight complementary diversity signals, including lexical, token entropy, sentence length, sentence pattern, adjacent sentence, Yules K, distinct N-gram and function word diversity. Formal definition of the diversity metrics can be found in Appendix E. Formally, we express the final combined diversity score in the formula below: Df inal = 0.15 (cid:88) Di + 0.1 (cid:88) Dj, (4) where: Di {Dlex, Dent, Dpat, Dbi} and Dj {Dlen, Dadj, Dyule, Df unc}. The choice of the weighting is further illustrated in Section 7.2."

Notably, by training solely on subjective tasks, we enhance both the subjective and objective reasoning abilities of models. Figure 4: (a) We plot the accuracy against the diversity for each setting (e.g. zero-shot, role-play, morethink, etc.) for each dataset. We observe positive linear correlation between the two metrics. (b) Qualitative example of the 34 most frequent roles in the training data generated by LRMs. more detailed visualization is presented in Figure 5. For the choice of RL algorithm, we found that GRPO yields more accurate and diverse responses than DPO. We attribute this to fundamental mismatch between DPOs training format and the nature of our task. Subjective questions do not have single \"correct\" answers, yet DPO requires rigid \"preferred-rejected\" pair for training. These results therefore demonstrate the superiority of GRPO for this context and validate the effectiveness of explicitly optimizing for diversity. Interestingly, Table 9 to 12 in the appendix show that our approach results in decrease in answer tokens compared to SFT, suggesting that mere verbosity does not lead to more accurate answers."

This shows our approachs generalizability is two-fold: generalizability to other subjective questions, and also generalizability to objective questions. We reveal that by only training on three subjective datasets, the model gains generalized understanding of role generation and role reasoning, and has near 10% accuracy gain in subjective tasks like cultural natural language inference in CALI. Moreover, without any training in objective questions, MultiRoleR1 significantly enhances the models performance on commonsense reasoning and math reasoning benchmarks. This demonstrates that subjective question training can potentially enhance the performance of objective questions. An explanation is that the nature of subjective questions pushes the model to gain insights from various perspectives, which collectively guides the model to approach the optimal solution.

Our framework enables models to think from multiple perspectives before providing final answer, enabling diverse answers for subjective questions. To achieve this, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with shaped reward that combines verifiable accuracy signal with diversity metric. Furthermore, through training on subjective questions solely, we are able to enhance the models performance on both subjective and objective reasoning. Our analysis reveals that diversity is more consistent indicator of performance than response length, showing strong per-task correlation with accuracy that significantly outweighs the correlation with length. This suggests that the improvements in modern reasoning models like o1 or R1 are driven by scaling law of diversity, not just superficial verbosity. Our work underscores the importance of diversity at both perspective and lexical levels, paving new directions for future research on diversity-enhance training of LRMs."

For the multirole supervised finetuning process, since the filtering results after self-consistency are still noisy, the final alignment performance may be constrained by the noisy labels in the positive samples. Our role generation solely depends on the model itself, which may not accurately represent the opinion of the real social community. Future work can further investigate the models culture and opinion alignment to different demographics, by incorporating the value of broader demographic of users. In addition, beyond text-only data, extending diversity-enhanced reasoning in the multimodal domain through thinking with images (Su et al., 2025) stands as another underexplored yet meaningful research area to investigate further."

E.1 Formulation of the Diversity Metric We provide detailed diversity scores across different baseline inference settings. The diversity scores are derived from weighted combination of seven distinct diversity aspects: Lexical Diversity (Dlex): Measures the variety of unique words in text using the TypeToken Ratio (TTR) (Hess et al., 1984), reflecting vocabulary richness. Entropy Diversity (Dent): Evaluates the unpredictability of word usage based on information entropy (Kalimeri et al., 2014), capturing distributional variety. Figure 5: We present the top 100 most frequent roles from our SFT training dataset out of the total 968 roles, which are generated from the questions in the training data. The diameters of the circles are proportional to the frequency. Sentence Length Diversity (Dlen): Assesses variation in sentence lengths using the coefficient of variation (Chen et al., 2020), indicating structural diversity. Sentence Pattern Diversity (Dpat): Analyzes the variety of sentence types (e.g., declarative, interrogative) and their distribution (Shaib et al., 2025). Adjacent Sentence Diversity (Dyule): Examines differences between consecutive sentences using Jaccard distance (Farouk, 2019), highlighting contextual shifts. Yules Diversity (Dbi): Reflects vocabulary distribution by analyzing word frequency patterns (Tanaka-Ishii and Aihara, 2015), with lower values indicating higher diversity. bigrams) in the text (Li et al., 2016), showcasing phrase-level variety. Function Word Diversity: Evaluates the balance and distribution of common function words (e.g., articles, prepositions) to assess linguistic variety (Segarra et al., 2015).

            "content": "During the exploration of the diversity metric design, we previously attempted to use the embedding similarity of different role perspectives as the diversity metric. Specifically, we split the model output by the Wait, token, each segment representing role opinion oi. We then used pretrained sentence embedding model to embed each opinion oi into vector Emb(oi) Rd. Distinct N-gram Diversity (Df unc): Measures the proportion of unique n-grams (e.g., For each pair of the opinion embeddings (Emb(oi), Emb(oj)), we compute the distance Few-shot Prompt for Few-shot Role Generation in CSQA Please generate 2-5 role perspective to answer the following question. Be creative when generating the roles and try to generate roles that may have conflicting opinion. The role perspective should be in the format of list ONLY: [role content 1, role content 2, ...] Do not include any other information. Here are some examples that you should follow: 1. Input: Question: The dental office handled lot of patients who experienced traumatic mouth injury, where were these patients coming from? Output: [Emergency room doctor, Police officer, Accident analyst] 2. Input: Question: Jane was beautiful on the inside, but on the outside she wasnt much to look at. How might she be described? Output: [Critic, Psychological counselor, Fashion blogger] 3. Input: Question: What does someone feel after running twenty six miles? Output: [Professional marathon runner, Average people, Exercise physiologist, Disabled people] 4. Input: Question: What would you do if you have curiosity about new show? Output: [Show director, Enthusiastic show fan, Busy people] 5. Input: Question: The comedian made dull joke about bald eagle and it ending up that way because of what treatment? Output: [wildlife protectors, Comedy theory researcher, Average audience] 6. Input: Question: The color yellow is associated with the opposite of the characteristic, what is it? Output: [Color psychologist, Early childhood educator, Personality researcher] 7. Input: Question: The golfer was great at keeping calm exterior as he finished up his final shots, but inside he was what because he knew he had won? Output: [Golf commentator, Sports psychologist, Main competitor] Your answer: Input: Figure 6: The detailed few-shot prompt in role generation stage for CSQA dataset. dij = cos(Emb(oi), Emb(oj)). We then define the Role Opinion Diversity Score (RODS): RODS = 2 n(n 1) (cid:88) i<j dij However, RODS turned out to be problematic metic, as the word embedding is sensitive to the lexical, which cannot fully capture the semantic differences of the role opinions. Therefore, we discard this metric and eventually adopted the combined length normalized diversity metric as in Table 9 to 12."
