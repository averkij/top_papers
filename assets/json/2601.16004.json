Concretely, we realize five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer pattern in the circuit (not physical signaling), and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes branch-conditioned evolution in which an observer subsystem (Wigners friend) evolves differently depending on the state of control qubit Q, followed by controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between branch-conditioned histories (conditional measurement contexts within single compiled circuit). We evaluate coherence-sensitive witnesses on specified four-qubit subset. Executing on the ibm fez backend (N = 20,000 shots), we obtain population-based visibility = 0.8771 0.0034, coherence witnesses WX = 0.8398 0.0038 and WY = 0.8107 0.0041, + 2 and phase-sensitive magnitude Cmag = (W 2 )1/2 = 1.1673 0.0040. This work does not claim to test or discriminate among interpretations of quantum mechanics. Unitary interpretations that reproduce standard quantum predictions remain operationally equivalent for these circuits. Instead, we frame the experiment as publicly reproducible constraint pipeline: given parameterized family of non-ideal channels (e.g., dephasing or collapselike perturbations) inserted at specified circuit locations, the coherence-sensitive witnesses define detectability thresholds relative to calibrated device noise. The accompanying reproducibility bundle provides full provenance (job IDs, calibration snapshots, software versions) enabling independent verification and extension."

            "content": "The Wigners friend thought experiment [1] and its extensions [2, 3] probe foundational questions about unitary quantum dynamics, measurement, and observer perspectives. The quantum information community has increasingly adopted circuits-as-foundations approach: encoding these thought experiments as explicit quantum circuits that can be analyzed, simulated, and executed on real quantum hardware [4, 5]. 6 2 0 2 2 2 ] - u [ 1 4 0 0 6 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r * Chief Scientist, Quantum Technology & Artificial Intelligence, Astradyne. Web: lab.christopheraltman.com Email: x@christopheraltman.com. 1 Violaris [6] proposes family of inter-branch communication protocols in which operations on superposed friend register enable conditional message transfer between branch-conditioned internal states. Branch interference effects, if present, should manifest in specific correlations that can be probed via appropriately chosen observables. The protocol provides concrete circuit template suitable for near-term quantum processors. Contributions of this work. We provide publicly reproducible IBM-hardware execution of minimal branch-transfer circuit benchmark with the following features: 1. Coherence-witness diagnostics: Beyond the standard population-based visibility , we measure multi-qubit Pauli-parity correlators (WX , WY ) that are sensitive to off-diagonal coherences potentially missed by . 2. Backend-matched noise modeling: We compare hardware results against Qiskit Aer simulations using noise models derived from contemporaneous ibm fez calibration data [7]. 3. Nonunitary channel constraint pipeline: We demonstrate how parameterized dephasing channels can be constrained relative to observed witness values and device-noise bands. 4. Full provenance: Job IDs, calibration snapshots, software versions, and SHA256 hashes for all artifacts enable independent verification. We emphasize what this work does not claim: it does not uniquely test or confirm any interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Many-Worlds interpretation, Copenhagen-style collapse models, and other unitary completions all predict identical measurement statistics for these circuits when the evolution is unitary. The experiments value lies in (a) demonstrating that branch-transfer primitives behave consistently with unitary predictions on real hardware, and (b) establishing methodology for constraining specific nonunitary perturbations should future experiments seek to test such models. Related work. Experimental implementations of Wigners-friend scenarios on quantum processors include the photonic realization by Proietti et al. [4] and the extended Wigners friend test by Bong et al. [5]. Those works focus on Bell-type inequalities and local friendliness assumptions. Our work differs in targeting the inter-branch communication primitive specifically and in emphasizing coherence-witness diagnostics as complement to population-based metrics. The IBM Quantum platform [8] and Qiskit software stack [9, 10] provide the infrastructure for our hardware execution. Related constraint results. Mukherjee and Hance [11] analyze timelike constraints on absoluteness of observed events assumptions in Wigners-friend settings. Our work is complementary: we focus on an implementable circuit primitive inspired by inter-branch communication protocols and report its empirical compilation and noise behavior on superconducting quantum hardware, without adopting observer-independent event absolutism."

After transpilation to hardware, these are mapped to physical qubit indices on the device; the mapping is recorded in the reproducibility bundle (assets/bundles/wigner-friend-v2b/appendix/). The coherence witnesses WX and WY are four-qubit Pauli correlators measured on (Q, R, F, ). The visibility protocol measures only two qubits (R and ). The circuit consists of three stages: (i) preparation of branch-conditioned evolution where evolves differently depending on the state of Q; (ii) application of controlled message-transfer primitive that creates correlations between R, , and ; and (iii) measurement in either the computational basis (for visibility) or rotated bases (for coherence witnesses)."

            "content": "We turn witness measurements into an exclusion bound on parameterized channel family inserted at specified circuit locations. 1. Channel family: Define parameterized family of channels Eλ (e.g., single-qubit dephasing with strength λ [0, 1]) and specify the circuit insertion point. 2. Predicted deviation curves: For each λ, simulate the circuit with the channel inserted and compute predicted values of , WX , WY , Cmag. 3. Detectability threshold: channel strength λ is detectable if the predicted deviation in at least one witness exceeds the combined uncertainty band (shot noise device-noise proxy derived from backend-matched simulation discrepancy). 4. Constraint: The observed hardware values constrain the channel strength to λ < λmax where λmax is the detectability threshold. Worked example (phase-flip dephasing estimate). Consider single-qubit phase-flip (dephasing) channel applied to the friend register after the branch split, Eλ(ρ) = (1 λ)ρ + λ ZρZ. (5) For observables containing Pauli or on the friend qubit (which anticommute with the error operator Z) on the friend qubit, the channel attenuates expectations by factor (1 2λ). To first order, the coherence witnesses scale as WX (λ) (1 2λ) WX (0), WY (λ) (1 2λ) WY (0). (6) Using the ideal value WX (0) 1 and the measured hardware value (hw) the illustrative estimate = 0.8398, we obtain 2 In the full pipeline we use backend-matched noisy simulation to define the detectability band and report the corresponding λmax as the conservative bound for the chosen insertion point and channel family. (7) λest 1W (hw) = 0.080. Terminology note: We refer to the channel family as parameterized dephasing/nonunitary channel toy model rather than labeling it with interpretation-specific names (e.g., Copenhagen collapse). The constraint applies to the channel family under the assumed insertion point and noise calibration; it does not uniquely identify physical mechanisms. The bundled forecast panels (Figures 3a and 3b) illustrate how coherence witnesses degrade as channel strength increases, while diagonal visibility can remain comparatively insensitive depending on where the channel is inserted. This motivates the use of WX and WY as primary diagnostics for any future searches for nonunitary deviations."

When could this become interpretation-relevant? In principle, if future experiments observed statistically robust deviations from unitary predictions that persisted across: multiple hardware backends with independent calibration, different transpilation and error-mitigation strategies, exhaustive exclusion of hardware artifacts (crosstalk, leakage, calibration drift, coherent errors), systematic variation of circuit parameters, and if such deviations matched the signature of specific nonunitary model while being inconsistent with any plausible noise mechanism, this could constitute evidence relevant to interpretation debates. The present work does not observe any such deviation; it establishes baseline methodology for potential future investigations."

The experiment establishes baseline measurements and methodology without claiming interpretation-level conclusions. Outlook. This work serves as proof-of-concept demonstration on superconducting qubits. Ongoing follow-up studies aim to replicate the same inter-branch message-transfer primitive across multiple quantum computing modalitiesgate-model superconducting and ion-trap devices, neutralatom analog platforms, photonics, and annealing-style hardwarevarying connectivity and compilation constraints while preserving identical logical structure. The goal is to quantify crossmodality compilation tax (e.g., depth/2Q-gate overhead and fidelity loss relative to an ideal logical circuit) and develop generalized connectivity scaling law for realizing inter-branch communication primitives under realistic hardware constraints. Future directions aligned with Violaris complexity axis. Violaris [6] discusses how protocol complexity scales with branch divergence. Natural extensions include: Branch divergence scaling: Represent friend-0 and friend-1 states as k-qubit bitstrings whose Hamming distance grows under branch evolution. The branch-swap operation then becomes longer X-string (product of gates), yielding complexity-vs-coherence scaling benchmark. Multi-backend replication: Execute on multiple IBM Quantum backends and other platforms to assess reproducibility and identify backend-specific artifacts. Calibration-synchronized repeats: Run experiments immediately after fresh calibration cycles to minimize drift effects. Error mitigation: Apply randomized compiling, Pauli twirling, or zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) to witness observables, enabling tighter constraints on nonunitary channels."
