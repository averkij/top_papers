To move beyond\npassive generation toward autonomous action, researchers have increasingly focused on agentic AI,\nwhich emphasizes self-directed behavior, complex reasoning abilities, and environment interaction.\nThe rise of agentic AI is widely regarded as the next stage in the evolution of AI systems.",
            "content": "Across both academia and industry, three core capabilities are consistently highlighted as central to agentic AI: Planning: to decompose high-level goals into coherent, multi-step strategies. Tool use: to invoke and coordinate external resources such as APIs, databases, or other models. Memory: to retain, retrieve, and manage information over extended horizons. The development of agentic AI is deeply intertwined with the evolution of how its core capabilities are implemented, process that has been undergoing profound paradigm shift."

            "content": "Pipeline-based Paradigm. Early attempts for constructing agents can be characterized as pipeline paradigm, where the agents core capabilities were largely facilitated by external structures in workflow-style architecture: Planning in early systems often relied on external symbolic planners such as PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language), e.g., LLM+P [126] generated plan by domain-independent engines rather than by the model itself. Later, this evolved to eliciting reasoning chains directly from the model through prompts like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [244] and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [276], where the model articulates its intermediate thinking process step-by-step. Tool use initially appeared as single-turn functional calls [165], where the model generated structured API request parsed and executed by the system. This later advanced to multi-turn frameworks like ReAct [277], which prompts the model to interleave reasoning traces with action calls following an external Thought-Action-Observation loop. Memory has long been addressed with external modules. Short-term memory was typically maintained through conversation summary [18], where long interaction histories were summarized and reinserted to fit within the context window. Long-term memory usually relied on retrieval-based methods, most prominently through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [97], which stored past interactions in vector database and retrieved them on demand. In this paradigm, the essential capabilities of agency were not intrinsic to the model, but rather engineered externally and imposed through handcrafted pipelines. We introduce the following formal definition: J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Sang et al. Definition 1 (Pipeline-based Agentic AI). Pipeline-based agentic AI conceptualizes the agent as system where Large Language Model (LLM) serves as functional component orchestrated by external, handcrafted logic. Formally, the agents policy 𝜋agent is composite function, where its final action 𝑎 is constrained and manipulated by an external pipeline (either system workflow or model prompt) 𝑓pipeline, acting upon the LLMs internal policy 𝜋𝜃 : 𝑎 = 𝑓pipeline(𝜋𝜃 ). While the pipeline-based paradigm offers modularity and degree of interpretability, its limitations were apparent: such systems heavily rely on carefully engineered pipelines, making them both rigid and brittle. Since the execution logic follows pre-scripted procedure, these systems struggle to adapt when faced with unforeseen circumstances or dynamically changing environments. Pipeline-based paradigm treats the LLM as passive, reactive tool rather than proactive, autonomous decision-maker. Model-native Paradigm. In response to the limitations of pipeline-based paradigm, agentic AI is undergoing paradigm shift centered on the principle of model-native. This represents move away from building complex external agentic systems, toward training powerful agentic model that effectively becomes the system itself. In the old pipeline-based paradigm, an agent was conceptualized as composite system linked together through prompts or workflow scripts. By contrast, the emerging model-native paradigm envisions the agent as single, unified model that, through end-to-end training, has learned to autonomously perform high-level functions. Planning, tool use, and memory management are no longer external scripts or templates but progressively internalized within the model itself: Planning was first internalized in OpenAIs reasoning model o1 [166] through large-scale reinforcement learning, demonstrating the feasibility that LLM could learn to think and plan autonomously. This line of work was advanced by DeepSeeks R1 [38], where reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards was sufficient to train reasoning and planning behaviors, significantly reducing the need for costly, step-by-step supervision. Tool use has likewise moved inside the model. OpenAIs o3 model [167] exemplified the integration of tool use into reasoning process, learning when and how to invoke diverse set of tools as part of its internal policy. Moonshots K2 [88] further scaled this direction by synthesizing large-scale tool-use trajectories combined with multi-stage RL process, strengthening agentic tool use and multi-step decision making. Memory has also begun to shift from external modules to model-native mechanisms. For short-term memory, Qwen-2.5-1M [268] leveraged synthetic long-sequence data to extend the native context windows, addressing the challenge of remembering long-horizon information. Beyond remembering, recent works attempt to effectively using the information, e.g., MemAct [311] reframed context management as tool the agent learns to call, proactively deciding when and how to store or retrieve information based on dynamic state and environmental feedback. For long-term memory, representative works like MemoryLLM [238] pioneered parameterizing memory directly, where set of latent memory tokens is continuously updated as part of the models forward pass, resulting in automatically updated internal knowledge. It is easy to see that, in contrast to the pipeline-based paradigm, this emerging model-native paradigm regards LLMs as autonomous decision-makers which learn to generate plans, invoke tools, and manage memory as intrinsic behaviors. This shift leads to the following definition: J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI Definition 2 (Model-native Agentic AI). Model-native agentic AI refers to the paradigm where the core capabilities of agency are progressively internalized within the LLMs parameters. Formally, the agents policy is monolithic and synonymous with the LLMs internal policy: 𝜋agent 𝜋𝜃 . The model directly learns to map state 𝑠 to final action 𝑎 by optimizing its policy 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑠) to maximize task-oriented objective."

            "content": "Deep Research Agent. An early form of the Deep Research agent was AI search, exemplified by systems like Perplexity [4], which constructed an agent pipeline involving steps such as query expansion, information retrieval, and answer generation. Google was the first to introduce Deep Research agent [58], upgrading the single-turn AI search to multi-turn, iterative research process. However, early versions of Googles Deep Research agent still relied on carefully engineered pipeline to manage the multi-turn search and final report generation. The paradigm shifted with OpenAIs introduction of the first model-native Deep Research agent [163], which was fine-tuned based on its agentic foundation model o3. This approach, where the models internal policy learns to strategize the entire research process, significantly enhanced long-horizon consistency and the depth of information discovery, establishing Deep Research as an advanced assistant capable of tackling rigorous professional tasks. More recently, Tongyi Labs WebAgent series have advanced the open-source implementation of model-native Deep Research agents. This includes WebSailor [102], which addressed the critical challenge of synthesizing highquality trajectory data for uncertain tasks, and culminated in the Tongyi DeepResearch model [92], which is capable of executing complex, multi-step research tasks in dynamic web environments. Compared with pipeline-based systems, model-native Deep Research agents demonstrate longhorizon consistency, deeper exploration, and greater adaptability to diverse information environments. Nevertheless, two key research challenges remain. First, operating on the open web exposes the agent to pervasive information noise, and outcome-driven RL may amplify hallucinations by rewarding spurious correlations rather than factual grounding. Second, defining rewards for open-ended research tasks is inherently difficult: unlike tasks with verifiable answers, research outputs are judged by subjective qualities such as insightfulness and critical analysis. Developing reward models that capture these nuanced criteria remains key frontier. GUI Agent. Early GUI agents often adopted pipeline-based approach, built workflow that orchestrated powerful, closed-source LLMs. For instance, AppAgent [300] builds pipeline where the LLM is orchestrated through XML view-hierarchy information, using structured metadata to perceive UI elements and generate tap/swipe actions. Mobile-Agent [228, 229] developed multimodal agent pipeline, invoking specialized perception tools such as object detection and OCR to ground UI elements directly from screenshots. These systems typically paired general-purpose J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 6 Sang et al. Fig. 1. From Pipeline to Model-native: RL-driven evolution of agentic capabilities and applications. model with specialized tools for perception and action, relying on an external workflow to guide the agents behavior. More recently, the trend has shifted towards developing model-native solutions, which internalize perception, planning, grounding, and action execution into unified policy. UI-TARS [185] represents an early step in model-native GUI agent design. Instead of wrapping model with orchestrated pipelines, UI-TARS was trained end-to-end to predict low-level actions from visual and UI context under supervised trajectory datasets. GUI-Owl [279] and OpenCUA [237] advanced this paradigm further by fully internalizing GUI planning and execution via reinforcement learning. By optimizing outcome-based rewards over long horizons, they gained robustness, adaptability, and the ability to decide when and how to act beyond imitation. Compared to pipeline-based systems, model-native paradigm enables GUI agents to tackle more complex and flexible tasks without brittle external scripts. Nevertheless, model-native GUI agents face unique challenges. First, unlike high-level text-based tasks, their inputs and outputs are inherently fine-grained and low-level, requiring the agent to reason over pixel-level visual cues, widget hierarchies, and precise action sequences such as taps, swipes, and text entries. Small perception or grounding errors can easily cascade into task failure. Second, GUI environments evolve as dynamic interface states, e.g., the same webpage may differ across time due to layout changes, pop-ups, or backend updates. This non-stationarity makes parallel exploration and reinforcement learning particularly difficult, since trajectories collected once may not generalize to later executions of the same task."

Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 7 illustrates the paradigm shift from pipeline-based to model-native agentic AI, contextualized by the evolution of RL algorithms. From SFT to RL. Before RL became the focus, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was the primary method for enhancing LLM capabilities. The premise of SFT is to train the model to imitate dataset of ground-truth trajectories. However, unlike perception-level tasks such as object classification where humans can easily and reliably provide labels, agentic tasks usually operate at the cognitive and executive level. Real-world agent tasks, such as writing research report, involve multi-step reasoning, iterative information retrieval before drafting the final report. Constructing complete trajectories for such tasks is prohibitively expensive and, in many cases, practically infeasible for human annotators. Reinforcement learning elegantly bypasses the need for explicit procedural supervision by fundamentally reframing the learning problem. It shifts the objective from imitating static dataset of how to act to exploring within dynamic environment to learn what actions lead to success. This process can be formalized as Markov Decision Process (MDP): at each step, the model observes task context (state) and produces an actiona sequence of text or specific decision. The environment then provides feedback signal in the form of reward, reflecting the quality or utility of the models action with respect to the overall task. The models objective is to learn policy 𝜋𝜃 that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over the task horizon. By learning from the relative value of different trajectories, the model can gradually refine its policy through experience without step-by-step instruction. This transformation is critical because it allows the model to discover novel and potentially more optimal strategies that may not exist in human-curated data, turning it from passive imitator into an active explorer. RL for LLMs. Early RL methods for LLMs largely treated the model as static sequence generator, with the objective of aligning the output to human preference data. representative example is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [191] and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [189], which were widely applied in the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [169] framework. In this setup, separate reward model is first trained to convert human preferences into numerical rewards, which are then used to fine-tune the LLM via PPO/DPO. Such methods proved highly effective at optimizing single-turn behaviors, like enabling models to better follow instructions and generate content aligned with human values. Yet, these RL methods are insufficient to train agentic models. Agents operate in multi-turn interactions and dynamic environments, often entailing long-term dependencies and sparse rewards. PPO/DPO and RLHF, which rely heavily on dense and step-level supervision, cannot efficiently optimize policies for long-horizon tasks. To address these issues, new set of outcome-driven RL algorithms has emerged to address the practical challenges of training stability and efficiency in long-horizon tasks. To counter the inefficiency of PPOs large critic network, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [193] was proposed. It introduces lightweight evaluation paradigm that computes advantages based on the relative rewards within group of sampled responses, circumventing the need for an absolute value critic and improving training stability. Further refining this, Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) [285] improves performance in multi-turn interactions by decoupling the clipping mechanism for positive and negative advantages and employing dynamic sampling strategies, making it particularly effective for training long-horizon agents. Following these advancements, other RL innovations [109, 223, 271] have continued to emerge, further enabling large-scale, high-efficiency training on LLMs. This progression has culminated in what is now considered unified training solution: 𝐿𝐿𝑀 + 𝑅𝐿 + 𝑇 𝑎𝑠𝑘, where base model is enhanced via RL learning algorithm within well-defined task environment. Together, these J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 8 Sang et al. algorithmic advances collectively form the central driver behind the model-native paradigm of agentic AI."

CoT prompt consists of 𝐾 few-shot exemplars, denoted as 𝐸 = {(𝑞 (𝑖 ), 𝑟 (𝑖 ) 1:𝑇𝑖 each exemplar consists of an instruction 𝑞 (𝑖 ) , reasoning trajectory 𝑟 (𝑖 ) 𝑎 (𝑖 ) . , 𝑎 (𝑖 ) )}𝐾 𝑖=1, where 1:𝑇𝑖 , and final answer The full prompt fed to the model is concatenation 𝑥prompt = [𝐸; 𝑞]. When the models policy 𝜋𝜃 processes the concatenated prompt 𝑥prompt, the probability of generating the subsequent reasoning chain 𝑅 = 𝑟1:𝑇 and answer 𝑎 is the product of the conditional probabilities for each token: 𝑃 (𝑅, 𝑎[𝐸; 𝑞]) = 𝑇 (cid:214) 𝑡 =1 𝑃𝜃 (𝑟𝑡 [𝐸; 𝑞], 𝑟<𝑡 ) 𝑃𝜃 (𝑎[𝐸; 𝑞], 𝑟1:𝑇 ), (1) The presence of the exemplar 𝐸 in the conditioning context creates strong pattern, significantly increasing the probability of generating sequence that begins with reasoning chain 𝑅 that resembles 𝑟 (𝑖 ) 1:𝑇𝑖 . In other words, CoT prompting externally injects procedural structure into the input, allowing 𝜋𝜃 to mimic multi-step reasoning. The generated reasoning chain is therefore not an internalized behavior, but rather an elicited one. The Out-of-Distribution Gap. This reliance on in-context pattern matching is precisely why the pipeline-based paradigm is brittle. The model has not learned why the reasoning steps are J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 9 logical or effective, but only learned that they are textually plausible in the given context. The effectiveness of such handcrafted pipelines is thus limited because large-scale natural corpora, used for pre-training, rarely contain the kind of structured, procedural data that would directly support learning the conditional probability. Specifically, the conditional distribution invoked by CoT prompting, 𝑃𝜃 (𝑅, 𝑎[𝐸; 𝑞]), often deviates from the distribution that the LLM was exposed to during pretraining. Pretraining primarily optimizes 𝑃𝜃 (𝑎𝑞) over naturalistic instruction-answer pairs. Since the model rarely encountered trajectories of the form (𝑞, 𝑟1:𝑇 , 𝑎), the structured prompt context 𝑥prompt = [𝐸; 𝑞] is often Out-ofDistribution (OOD) with respect to the data model was trained. The models ability to follow CoT patterns is therefore fragile: it may succeed when the test query is similar to exemplar queries, but fails to generalize in OOD cases. Without an internalized planning policy, the model may fail to follow the reasoning structure, and produce incoherent reasoning steps and ungrounded answers. The Necessity of RL. As discussed above, pipelines such as CoT prompting do not update the models parameters 𝜃 . Instead, they manipulate the input sequence to make the desired output pattern more probable. To bridge the OOD gap and create an internalized capability, the models parameters must be explicitly optimized. Still taking planning as the example, we can reframe the planning problem from probabilistic perspective. Instead of directly mapping query to an answer, model with native planning ability will first reason and then answer. This can be viewed as marginalizing the final answer probability over the space of all possible reasoning trajectories 𝑅: 𝑃 (𝑎𝑞) = 𝑅 𝑃 (𝑅𝑞) 𝑃 (𝑎𝑅, 𝑞) 𝑑𝑅, (2) where 𝑅 = (𝑟1:𝑇 ) denotes the latent reasoning trajectory. To internalize this planning process, the models policy must learn to model both terms: the policy over reasoning trajectories, 𝑃 (𝑅𝑞), and the conditional generation of the answer given the reasoning trajectory, 𝑃 (𝑎𝑅, 𝑞). One approach to achieve this is through SFT during post-training. This requires datasets of (𝑞, 𝑅, 𝑎) triples obtained via either human annotation or data synthesis. However, as previously discussed, human annotation of optimal reasoning paths is prohibitively expensive and sometimes even impossible for complex tasks. While, synthetic data generation is ultimately limited by the capabilities of the base model. RL addresses this by allowing the policy 𝜋𝜃 to explore complete reasoning trajectories 𝜏 in an environment, and to update its parameters based on outcome-driven rewards (𝜏) without requiring full procedural supervision. Formally, the optimization objective can be expressed as: 𝜃 = arg max 𝜃 E𝜏𝜋𝜃 (cid:2)R (𝜏)(cid:3), (3) where 𝜏 = (𝑟1:𝑇 , 𝑎) denotes reasoning trajectory consisting of intermediate steps 𝑟1:𝑇 and final answer 𝑎. Furthermore, RL offers two fundamental advantages over SFT for internalizing the agentic capabilities: (1) RL enables shift from static data feeding to dynamic sample generation. In SFT, the model is passive recipient of fixed dataset. In contrast, RL enables adaptive and exploratory learning: the model continuously updates its behavior through interaction, generating new trajectory samples 𝜏 𝜋𝜃 as its policy 𝜋𝜃 evolves. (2) RL provides more flexible feedback mechanism, moving from absolute ground-truth fitting to relative value learning. Unlike SFT, which minimizes loss against single, pre-defined correct trajectory, RL optimizes for relative outcomes by rewarding trajectories that lead to better task performance even without explicit ground truth.

            "content": "Exploration Efficiency: from Random Search to Prior-guided Exploration. In classical RL, the agent begins with random policy and learns solely through trial and error. The policy 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑠) is initialized randomly and gradually refined by maximizing expected cumulative rewards across trajectories sampled from an initially unstructured distribution. This process is computationally expensive and sample-inefficient, as the agent must repeatedly explore large amount of low-value or irrelevant states before converging to an optimal policy. By contrast, an LLM pretrained on massive corpora already encodes extensive factual and procedural knowledge, which acts as strong prior over both the state and action spaces. As result, the models policy is no longer initialized randomly but anchored by structured prior 𝜋prior(𝑎𝑠, K), where represents world knowledge embedded in the pretrained weights. The RL objective thus becomes: 𝜃 = arg max 𝜃 E𝜏𝜋𝜃 (𝜏 ) (cid:2)R (𝜏)(cid:3), (4) which can be viewed as fine-tuning the knowledge-conditioned policy to better align with taskspecific reward signals (𝜏). This prior-guided exploration significantly improves sample efficiency, enables meaningful trajectory discovery in early training, and prevents the policy from degenerating into random or repetitive behaviors. In essence, RL for LLMs does not learn from scratch, but rather performs exploratory refinement of pretrained world model through feedback-driven optimization. Generalization across Tasks: Universal Environment, Action and Reward Interfaces. Classical RL operates within narrowly defined environments, where both the state and action spaces are explicitly specified and the reward function is handcrafted for single objective. Each policy 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑠) is trained to optimize performance within this constrained setup, which is tightly coupled to its environment. As result, classical RL agents, including systems like AlphaGo [198] and robotic manipulation controllers, are highly specialized and rarely generalize beyond their predefined domains. By contrast, RL for LLMs operates within an open-ended, language-mediated environment where every element of the RL tuple is represented through text or symbolic tokens. The state 𝑠𝑡 corresponds to the evolving textual or multimodal context, capturing task descriptions, retrieved evidence, and interaction history. The action 𝑎𝑡 is expressed as generated text, tool invocations, or GUI operations, serving as universal and compositional control interface that allows one policy to act across diverse domains. Crucially, the reward (𝜏) can also be defined in flexible and semantic terms: success in reasoning, factual correctness, user preference alignment, or even programmatic verification (e.g., passing unit tests or symbolic proofs). This language-based representation collapses the boundaries between distinct RL tasks, creating unified state-action-reward interface for different forms of reasoning and interaction.

Physics vs. AI: methodological singularities and subcequent shifts in research focus. RL from domain-specific algorithm into general optimizer, bridging reasoning, decision-making, tool use, and memory management within one integrated agentic framework. Unified Solution: LLM + RL + Task. Recently, it is widely discussed that the development of AI has entered the second half [274]. Rather than designing solutions for specific problems, research now starts from unified methodology, LLM with RL, and seeks appropriate tasks through which to evaluate and further enhance model capabilities. The proposal of challenging benchmarks has thus become critical for advancing LLMs and agents. This includes GAIA [153] for assessing general-purpose agent capabilities, SWE-Bench [81] for evaluating project-level programming, AndroidWorld [190] for real-world GUI operations, BrowseComp [243] for challenging deep research tasks, MCP-Universe [140] for evaluating multi-agent collaboration and planning, and most recently, FutureX [298] for examining the predictive abilities of LLM agents. The unified paradigm of model-native agentic model training can be formulated as: + Mbase (cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125) Base Model Alearn (cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125) Learning Algorithm + Etask (cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125) Task Environment . (5) where Mbase provides general world knowledge and reasoning priors, Alearn (e.g., RL or preference optimization) adapts and refines these capabilities through interaction and optimization, and Etask defines the environment, tool set, and reward signals that contextualize learning. Recently, growing body of work demonstrates how research across NLP, vision, robotics, and scientific domains is increasingly converging on this formula. This is strikingly analogous to the unification of Physics after Newton. Before Newton, physical subfields were fragmented: Celestial mechanics was governed by Keplers laws describing planetary motion, Terrestrial mechanics was pioneered by Galileos studies of falling bodies, and fields like Optics and Fluid dynamics had their own disparate empirical and geometric principles. Newtons Three Laws of Motion, Law of Universal Gravitation, together with the powerful mathematical tool of Calculus, provided universal framework that unified the experimental research of the heavens and the earth under single set of principles, achieving an unprecedented unification for Physics. This precisely resembles the role that LLM + RL plays today for AI. LLM provides unified model of world knowledge and foundational reasoning, much like Newtons laws. Meanwhile, RL offers dynamic, goal-oriented optimization framework, analogous to the problem-solving engine of Calculus. Following the development of Physics after Newton, as summarized in Table 1, we discuss the shift in AIs research focus after the LLM + RL methodological singularity. The new focus may range from the expansion of applications into practical and complex domains like healthcare, scientific discovery and social system simulation, to the enhancement of advanced agentic capabilities such as continual learning, safety and alignment, and ultimately toward possibly new theories on general intelligence.

            "content": "ComputeIntelligence Conversion in AI Development. To further understand the role of RL in training agentic models, it is useful to review the evolution of AI development. With computational power growing at rate of 3-4𝑥 per year, the total increase in compute over the last two decades has been on the order of trillion-fold, making compute non-negligible driving force. An intriguing view holds that, an underlying thread of AI development over this period has been the effort to convert the ever-growing compute into intelligence gains with maximum efficiency [31]. As illustrated in the upper half of Fig. 2, this thread has unfolded in two major stages: Model architecture advancement. During the first ten years (approx. 2010-2020), progress was mainly driven by architectural innovations that enabled the efficient consumption of massive compute and data. The evolution from Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [32] to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) [90] and then to Transformer [220] was creating models capable of effectively utilizing and encoding data into an ever-increasing number of parameters. Data-centric scaling. Over the last five years, the focus has shifted to the data side. SelfSupervised Learning (SSL), particularly next-token prediction [188], first unlocked the ability to use the entire internet as pretraining corpus. The current frontier is the use of RL in posttraining to convert compute into high-quality synthetic data, which can be further divided in two sub-stages: (1) RL for LLMs (Internal Reasoning): The synthesized data is internal without environment interaction, i.e., the procedural data such as reasoning trajectories that do not exist in the pre-training corpus. (2) RL for LLM Agents (Environmental Interaction): This involves interactive RL learning through tool invocation and environmental feedback, which generates interaction data that captures the consequences of the agents actions. We can see that the ever-growing computational capacity has been systematically converted into more powerful model intelligence by scaling both model parameters and data volume. Focusing on the post-training stage, both forms of RL-driven data synthesis rely on strong pretrained base models but also create new procedural and interaction data that can, in turn, enhance the next round of pretraining. This establishes positive feedback loop linking pretraining, post-training, and inference, in which RL serves as the critical mechanism continually transforming compute into intelligence. From this perspective, the involved three scaling laws in pretraining, post-training and J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 13 inference should no longer be viewed as independent, one-way relationships, but as interconnected components of cyclic system driving the self-improving evolution of agentic intelligence. Extrapolative and Interventional Data Synthesis. As previously discussed, RL mitigates the shortage of procedural data and alleviates OOD issues by synthesizing new data beyond the natural corpora used in pretraining. Understanding the characteristics of these synthesized data provides an alternative perspective on why RL is critical for acquiring agentic capabilities. As illustrated in the lower half of Fig. 2, RL generates two types of synthetic data, extrapolative and interventional data through internal reasoning and environmental interaction, respectively. Extrapolative data arise from internal cognitive tasks performed by the LLM itself. The model is incentivized to produce procedural data that are not present in original pretraining corpus, with reward signal then used to select and amplify high-quality samples. For example, in mathematical reasoning, internet-scale corpora may contain queries 𝑞 and answers 𝑎, along with the requisite knowledge (e.g., axioms, theorems), but they rarely contain complete, step-by-step solution trajectories (𝑞, 𝑟1:𝑇 , 𝑎). RL encourages the model to explore within its existing knowledge space via 𝑃𝜃 (𝑎, 𝑟1:𝑇 𝑞), combining known concepts to generate previously unseen reasoning paths. When path leads to correct answer, it is positively reinforced. This process is essentially form of structured extrapolation from the models pre-trained knowledge. Interventional data is generated when an agent is trained to interact with an external environment to complete tasks. Natural data are typically observational (for instance, (screenshot, click_position) pairs from human GUI operation logs), which merely reveal behavioral correlations: what humans tend to do in certain contexts. In contrast, RL allows the agent to actively perform interventions 𝑑𝑜 (𝑎𝑡 ) that change the environment from state 𝑠𝑡 to 𝑠𝑡 +1, receiving reward 𝜌𝑡 . Through learning from interventional data 𝑃𝜃 (𝑠𝑡 +1, 𝜌𝑡 𝑑𝑜 (𝑎𝑡 ), 𝑠𝑡 ) rather than passive observations 𝑃 (𝑠𝑡 +1𝑎𝑡, 𝑠𝑡 ), the agent acquires causal mapping from action to outcome, thereby learning to predict the consequences of its action. In essence, synthesizing interventional data through RL-driven environment interaction embodies what Rich Sutton describes as experience: the agent acquires experience by doing things, and through that experience, it builds its understanding of the world [199]."

Another category of pipeline-based methods, such as CoT [244] and ToT [276], elicits the models step-by-step reasoning capability during decoding through prompt engineering to accomplish planning.

Planning, as goal-directed decision-making process, fundamentally relies on the models reasoning abilities in comprehension, decomposition, logic, and causality. Inspired by this, clear trend has emerged: the internalization of planning capacities into the model. Through techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, complex planning and reasoning abilities are directly embedded into the model parameters, enabling more flexible and robust autonomous planning in open-world environments and ultimately eliminating dependence on external frameworks.

This approach significantly surpasses traditional planners relying on rigid symbolic logic in terms of generalization and flexibility. Among them, prompt-based planning, an early and widely explored category, requires no additional training. It operates exclusively by designing appropriate input prompts to guide the model in generating planning paths. Based on the topology of path generation, these methods can be roughly categorized into two types: linear and non-linear. Linear-structured Planning Methods. These methods decompose tasks into sequence of reasoning steps executed in order. representative approach is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which guides the model to produce intermediate reasoning steps. This is achieved by providing few-shot exemplars or zero-shot cues such as Lets think step by step, enabling the model to progressively arrive at the final answer. This approach breaks down complex problems into logically coherent sub-steps, improving the transparency and interpretability of reasoning and helping reduce errors caused by the model omitting steps. However, the linear structure is inherently local, sequential reasoning mode, lacking global perspective on the overall task, making it difficult to handle complex planning scenarios that require multi-path exploration or backtracking. Nonlinear-structured Planning Methods. These methods generate multiple possible thought nodes during reasoning, forming tree or graph-based search space, and incorporate external or internal evaluation mechanisms for path selection and optimization. For example, Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [276] structures reasoning as tree, expanding multiple candidate reasoning paths at each step and selecting the optimal one via self-evaluation or external scoring. LLM+MCTS [267] integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with LLMs, leveraging simulation and backtracking to balance exploration and exploitation. RAP [68] formalizes reasoning as planning problem in state space, guided by policy and value functions to generate reasoning paths. Non-linear methods significantly enhance the models global planning capability by introducing search mechanisms during reasoning. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality of the external evaluator, and the generation and evaluation of numerous candidate paths lead to substantial increase in computational cost. In summary, prompt-based planning methods, characterized by training-free, ease of implementation, and high flexibility, have provided crucial foundation for the exploration of LLM-based planning. Nevertheless, their limitations are evident: they are highly sensitive to prompt design, exhibit unstable performance in complex tasks, and incur high token consumption costs due to the generation of extensive intermediate content. Consequently, the current research trend is shifting toward internalizing planning capacities into model parameters, shift that allows models to perform reasoning without relying on explicit search or external evaluators, thereby maintaining strong planning capabilities while significantly improving reasoning efficiency and stability."

Publication date: October 2025. 16 Sang et al. logic in natural web text, coupled with the high cost and lack of scalability of manual annotation. To address this data bottleneck, contemporary research has pursued two primary directions for constructing training sets: data synthesis and data distillation. Data Synthesis. Synthetic data denotes reasoning-enriched, long Chain-of-Thought (longCoT) data generated automatically via programmed rules, LLM-based self-generation, or search mechanisms, eliminating labor-intensive manual annotation. The core challenge lies in systematically generating diverse, challenging, and verifiable reasoning traces, replacing costly human labeling with automated quality control. Currently, the synthesis of high-quality Chain-of-Thought data primarily relies on two approaches: multi-path reasoning process sampling and tree-search methods, both requireing integration with effective quality filtering strategies. Multi-path reasoning-trajectory sampling. Multiple complete reasoning paths are sampled from the model and then filtered and corrected under pre-defined rules to obtain highquality data. For example, LIMO [280] demonstrates that selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories is pivotal for boosting model capability. s1 [158] further shows that small, carefully curated dataset can fine-tune models more effectively than large, unfiltered one. BOLT [174] uses in-context learning to elicit detailed reasoning and filters low-quality responses via outcome-based rewards, thereby automating quality control. In vertical domains, HuatuoGPT-o1 [20] targets verifiable medical problems, sampling correct paths and refining erroneous ones to construct reliable reasoning chains. Tree search. These typically combine Monte Carlo estimation or process reward models to enable fine-grained control over step-level quality [105, 106]. For instance, Marco-o1 [321] employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), using model confidence to guide exploration and synthesize high-quality reasoning data. WebSynthesis [52] introduces world model in Web-UI agent scenarios, combined with MCTS to generate web interaction trajectories at scale, supported by two-stage curriculum learning strategy to enhance policy capability. ReST-MCTS* [301] integrates process reward model with MCTS to collect higher-quality trajectories by assessing the value of each reasoning step. Regarding multimodal reasoning, AStar [248] defines an executable visual action space and leverages MCTS to obtain highquality visual reasoning data. To sum up, multi-path sampling focuses on the holistic evaluation and selection of complete reasoning paths, whereas tree search methods enable finer, step-level quality control through structured search and process rewards. Together, these two data synthesis approaches facilitate an effective balance between the quality and scale of synthetic data. Data Distillation. Data distillation refers to the process of extracting high-quality reasoning chains and final answers from strong, System-2 teacher model with advanced reasoning capabilities. After verifying answer correctness and applying simple filtering, this data is used to train student model. The goal is to transfer the teachers reasoning style and step-by-step strategies to more lightweight student model, thereby internalizing stable planning capabilities. The performance of this approach is highly dependent on the reasoning ability of the teacher model. In DeepSeek-R1 [38], for instance, the reasoning capability of the base model was first improved through direct RL, and then followed by data distillation. Only simple verification and filtering were required to obtain high-quality reasoning process data. After the release of DeepSeek-R1, thanks to its powerful reasoning performance, many studies have attempted to use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to distill high-quality reasoning data [63, 77, 94, 146, 148]. common characteristic of these works is the achievement of scalable and automated data production, significantly reducing the cost of manual annotation.

Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 17 In the training of reasoning models, supervised learning 3.3.2 Reinforcement Learning. remains effective but is constrained by its heavy reliance on large volumes of high-quality reasoning data. Moreover, the learned patterns often exhibit limited generalization [30, 255], making them less adaptable to complex and dynamic scenarios. As foundation models continue to improve, they increasingly possess strong inherent reasoning capabilities, which means the key challenge lies in how to effectively elicit and activate these abilities. This has made RL-based optimization viable and promising path. Early academic explorations primarily focused on process reward, aiming to shape the models reasoning trajectory through fine-grained supervision. However, the release of DeepSeek-R1 [38] has profoundly revealed the practical challenges associated with process reward, while successfully demonstrating the potential of using mere outcome reward. Accordingly, our discussion of reinforcement learning will also center around these two types of rewards. Process Reward. Process reward refers to the mechanism of evaluating the correctness of each intermediate step in models multi-step reasoning process and providing corresponding reward signals. The core idea is to ensure the reliability of the entire reasoning path through dense reward guidance. By providing fine-grained supervision over intermediate steps, Process Reward Model (PRM) is expected to not only identify and correct errors more effectively but also enhance the models performance on unseen problems. However, its effectiveness hinges on one critical prerequisite: the availability of large-scale, high-quality step-level supervision data. This reintroduces the bottleneck of supervised learning, i.e., the need for extensive, granular annotation, which represents the central challenge in PRM development. Based on the source and method of supervision signals, we categorize process reward into explicit process reward and implicit process reward. Explicit process reward. Explicit process reward relies on high-quality human annotations or reliable automatic labeling methods to obtain precise step-level reward signals. For instance, ProcessBench [322] constructs specialized step-level benchmarks through expert human annotation, providing reliable metrics for model performance. To address scalability limitations of manual labeling, many studies employ Monte Carlo (MC) estimation or LLM-as-Judge [99] methods, sampling and comparing multiple reasoning paths to assess step quality. For example, Math-Shepherd [233] assigns correctness scores to each mathimatical inference step via MC estimation, eliminating dependency on human annotation. OmegaPRM [136] enhances this approach by combining MC estimation with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), using binary search to locate the first erroneous step in reasoning chains, thereby improving data collection efficiency. Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM [318] notes that both MC estimation and LLM-as-Judge introduce noise in automatic labeling, while human annotation remains cost-prohibitive, thus proposing hybrid approach to reduce noise and improve accuracy. In executable domains like code generation, execution results can serve as process supervision signals: PRLCoder [281] determines line correctness through compilation and test execution, enabling precise line-by-line labeling. ORPS [286] integrates execution feedback directly into the reasoning loop, with each step evaluated based on program execution results. The advantage of execution feedback lies in its absolute objectivity (pass/fail test criteria), making this method particularly suitable for tasks with clear verification standards like code generation and theorem proving. Implicit process reward. Instead of relying on explicit process-level annotations, implicit process reward methods derive stepwise supervision directly from the models internal dynamics. The key idea is to approximate process rewards by using the language models own likelihood changes as proxy signal, i.e., measuring how each intermediate reasoning J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 18 Sang et al. step increases or decreases the final outcome probability. This allows for the efficient, on-thefly generation of dense rewards without requiring any process-level labels. The foundational work on Implicit PRM [287] first demonstrated this principle. It showed that an Outcome Reward Model (ORM), trained only on final outcome labels, could effectively generate process-level rewards during inference by calculating log-likelihood ratios. Building on this, PRIME [33] integrated this mechanism into full online reinforcement learning loop. Instead of just using the implicit rewards for inference-time evaluation, PRIME utilizes these implicitly generated, per-token dense rewards to directly compute advantage estimates for policy updates during training. This approach avoids the need to train separate, explicit PRM, significantly reducing development costs and complexity, and has shown notable improvements in performance on mathematical and code reasoning tasks. Overall, PRMs offer viable way for enhancing the controllability and generalization of reasoning models by providing fine-grained, step-level supervision, thereby effectively mitigating the challenge of reward sparsity in multi-step reasoning. However, as highlighted by DeepSeek-R1 [38], several critical challenges remain. First, the correctness of intermediate steps is often difficult to define and evaluate unambiguously, as step-quality criteria tend to be subjective and task-dependent. Second, obtaining high-quality process supervision data is challenging: manual annotation is prohibitively expensive, while automated labeling methods are generally prone to noise. Furthermore, PRMs are susceptible to reward hacking, where models may learn to exploit loopholes in the reward function rather than genuinely improving reasoning quality. These challenges collectively constrain the further development and application of PRMs, underscoring the need for future breakthroughs in evaluation frameworks, data construction, and training mechanisms. Outcome Reward. Outcome reward, also referred to as outcome supervision, provides reward signals based solely on the correctness of the final answer. It offers sparse yet unambiguous reward signal, grounded in the core hypothesis that powerful foundation model can, through feedback on end results, autonomously explore and internalize effective reasoning policy. Exemplified by the RLVF approach adopted in DeepSeek R1 [38], outcome reward completely bypasses the complex evaluation of intermediate steps and only requires verifying the correctness of the final answer [73, 216]. In tasks with easily verifiable answers, such as multiple-choice questions and mathematical problems, RL is typically applied using verifiable outcome rewards to enhance the models reasoning capability [137, 217, 313]. Similarly, in the domain of code generation, methods like o1-Coder [312] and RLEF [53] validate answer correctness based on program execution feedback. The primary advantages of outcome reward are its low cost and high reliability. The annotation cost is minimal because only the final answer needs verification, making the approach highly scalable. Furthermore, the reward signal is accurate and verifiable, as the correctness of final answer usually meets clear, objective standards, thereby avoiding the subjectivity and inconsistency issues that challenge process reward. As result, outcome reward has become one of the mainstream approaches for strengthening reasoning abilities in automatically verifiable tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Beyond learned outcome models, parallel line of work designs explicit rule-based rewards that score outputs or intermediate reasoning steps according to deterministic rules. These rules may enforce output formats, verify structural consistency, or constrain reasoning-chain length to mitigate redundant computation and balance accuracy with efficiency. Unlike learned reward models, this approach uses explicit rules to constrain and shape reasoning behaviors, offering simple and scalable method for supervision. Widely-used rules include: (1) format reward [38], which enforces specific output structure to ensure the stable extraction and verification of reasoning processes J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 19 and final answers, and (2) length-based reward [1, 135, 195, 283], which imposes constraints on the length of reasoning chains to control for redundant computation (overthinking) or to achieve controllable trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Similar to outcome rewards, rule-based rewards are characterized by their simplicity in design and ease of scalability. Their key function, however, is to provide auxiliary structural supervision that guides reasoning beyond the final answers correctness. Therefore, they are often combined with outcome rewards to create more holistic objective function that jointly guides the optimization of the models reasoning behavior."

            "content": "Within the evolution of the model-native paradigm, we observe two major shifts. First, there is transition from SFT to RL. While SFT serves as the foundation for ability internalization, its effectiveness is limited by the scarcity and high cost of high-quality annotated data. As base models become more capable, RL emerges as more effective post-training paradigm, alleviating the dependency on costly process-level supervision. Second, within RL itself, there is shift from process reward to outcome reward. Although process reward offers dense, step-by-step guidance, it faces serious challenges such as ambiguous definitions of intermediate step correctness, high labeling costs, and reward hacking. Exemplified by DeepSeek-R1 [38], research has established that sparse yet objective outcome rewards are sufficient to guide capable models toward effective reasoning, making this approach mainstream choice for verifiable domains like mathematics and code. It is often combined with rule-based rewards (e.g., for formatting or length constraints) to achieve more stable optimization. It is worth noting that this evolution from pipeline to model-native is not confined to linguistic planning. similar trajectory is observed in multi-modal reasoning: early multi-modal tasks often relied on external visual tools or complex prompting chains to connect vision and language modules, whereas current research aims to enable models to inherently process and reason over multi-modal information through end-to-end training, achieving genuine \"what you see is what you think\" reasoning [120]. Looking forward, research on model-native planning capabilities will evolve along the following directions: From explicit to implicit reasoning: Current explicit reasoning processes relying on Chainof-Thought enhance interpretability but incur significant computational and storage overhead. key future direction is achieving an implicit CoT, where the planning process occurs within the models hidden activations rather than generating lengthy textual steps [245]. This could substantially improve computational efficiency and better approximate the intuitive, rapid decision-making patterns of human experts.

From single-task to general and transferable planning: Current models are often trained for planning within specific domains (e.g., mathematics or code). significant future challenge lies in achieving cross-domain generalization and transfer of planning abilities [123, 204]. This requires models not only to learn problem-solving schemas for specific tasks but also to abstract general meta-cognitive planning abilities, such as task decomposition, subgoal management, and dynamic strategy adjustment, enabling improved generalization or rapid adaptation to new tasks."

The challenge of tool use is not solved by high-level\nplanning alone: each sub-goal must be executed. Therefore, for an agent to act upon the world, it\nmust also be able to plan the concrete sequence of actions required to achieve these sub-goals.",
            "content": "To systematically analyze this capability, we deconstruct tool use into two layers: planning and execution. It is critical to distinguish the planning discussed here from the task planning in the previous section. Here, planning refers to the action-level orchestration of tool invocations: determining the timing and sequence of tool calls and refining this action-plan based on feedback. The execution layer, in contrast, is responsible for generating the specific, syntactically correct invocation commands and interacting with the environment. Early explorations into tool use were notably marked by the introduction of single-turn functional calls [165], which largely focused on the execution layer. The models task was confined to generating single, structured API request in response to direct user query. However, for truly agentic system, tool use involves more sophisticated decision-making process with multi-turn interaction and dynamic adaption, i.e., the model must master both the strategic planning of when to use tools and the subsequent execution of those calls. This section will examine the paradigm shift in how both the planning and execution layers of tool use are implemented, from external pipeline-based systems to internalized, model-native policies. Early research methods primarily followed the pipeline-based paradigm, characterized by the externalization of tool-use decision logic. Specifically, one category of approaches relies on hardcoded system workflows, embedding the model into predefined execution nodes. Another category, carefully designing prompts, grants the model degree of autonomy by embedding the decision logic for tool use, covering invocation timing, tool selection, and parameter specification, within structured prompts to guide dynamic planning and execution during reasoning. Recently, the research on agentic tool use has shifted toward the model-native paradigm, which internalizes tool-use decision-making capabilities within the models parameters. This approach emphasizes the models ability to autonomously perform tool selection and invocation during reasoning. Along the two layers of planning and execution, existing studies can be divided into two categories: (1) Modular training decouples planning and execution, typically optimizing only the planner while delegating execution to external modules; (2) End-to-end training, in contrast, emphasizes the joint optimization of planning and execution, imposing supervision signals on J.

            "content": "In summary, for system-based workflows, the advantages include high predictability due to the fixed process, stable execution, less prone to errors, and ease of debugging and replication. However, this hard-coded design also leads to insufficient flexibility, difficulty in handling exceptions outside the predefined flow or complex tasks, poor generalization capability, and potential need for extensive system restructuring to add new tools or functions, limiting the rapid iteration and expansion of agent capabilities. Prompt-based methods delegate the decision-making author4.2.2 Prompt-based Methods. ity for tool use to LLM itself, where the overall control flow is dynamically generated by the models reasoning chain. Based on the relationship between planning and execution, we categorize existing prompt-based methods into: (1) Plan-and-Execute Separation: exemplified by Plan-andExecute, where planner generates high-level plan, and an executor carries it out step-by-step. (2) Interleaved Planning and Execution: exemplified by ReAct [277], where Thought and Action J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 23 are alternately generated within single reasoning sequence, and subsequent decisions are updated based on immediate Observation, forming closed-loop control adaptive to environmental feedback. Plan-and-Execute Separation. The model first formulates complete action plan, subsequently followed by step-by-step execution by the system or the model itself. This mode offers clear logic but struggles to adapt to unexpected deviations during execution. For instance, the PAL [51] method requires the model to write Python subroutines, which are then executed by an interpreter at runtime to obtain results. PoT [24] further expresses the entire reasoning chain as program code, effectively decoupling the reasoning process from numerical computation. For multimodal and knowledge-intensive tasks, Chameleon [131] explicitly separates planning and execution: an LLM acts as the planner, composing tool sequences (e.g., retrieval, Python functions, vision models, heuristic modules) as needed, which are then executed uniformly to produce the answer. Interleaving Planning and Execution. The model performs immediate reasoning at each step to decide the next action, observes the result after execution, and continues reasoning accordingly, forming dynamic decision-making process capable of adapting to environmental feedback. The ReAct framework [277] structures each interaction round into Thought-Act-Observation, forming multi-turn reasoning-action loop. This facilitates simultaneous evidence gathering and plan adjustment during reasoning, significantly enhancing the models adaptability in dynamic environments. It has demonstrated significant advantages in task success rate, reasoning transparency, and result reproducibility for knowledge-intensive QA and interactive environments. For example, Self-Ask [180] explicitly deconstructs complex questions into selfask-retrieve-synthesize substages, proving particularly adept at handling compositional reasoning tasks requiring multi-step information integration. In summary, prompt-based methods represent paradigm shift in tool-augmented language models, transitioning system control from rigid architectures to dynamic LLM-driven reasoning. While plan-and-execute separation provides structural clarity, interleaved planning and execution offers superior adaptability through real-time feedback integration. The choice between these approaches depends on task requirements: the former suits well-defined problems with predictable execution paths, whereas the latter excels in dynamic environments requiring iterative refinement."

Publication date: October 2025. 24 Sang et al. introduce additional noise, thereby weakening the effective propagation of learning signals. By contrast, the execution layer has single, verifiable objective that can typically be realized robustly via templates, rules, or frozen models. On this basis, removing the execution layer from the training loop and modularizing it while concentrating on optimizing the planner not only conserves the training budget for the primary task, avoiding expenditure on format learning and noise handling, but also substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability. End-to-end training refers to coupling planning and execution 4.3.2 End-to-end Training. under single objective, such that one model jointly learns the abilities for multi-step planning and action execution. While modular training offers greater control by isolating individual components, the shift toward fully end-to-end paradigm introduces two principal bottlenecks that the unified policy must now learn to handle directly: (1) cross-step credit assignment, which centers on the granularity of attributionwhether it is assigned at the trajectory level or the turn level; and (2) uncertainty in environmental feedback, which is largely determined by the type of environment static or simulated environments typically being more controllable and less noisy, whereas dynamic or real-world environments exhibit greater stochasticity and noisier feedback. Accordingly, the discussion of end-to-end training methods is organized along two axes: the granularity of credit assignment and the type of the environment. Credit-assignment Granularity. Credit assignment refers to attributing tasks final return or verifiable outcome to each tool-related decision (and its preceding reasoning) along the action sequence, thereby producing learnable signals for policy optimization. The design of the creditassignment scheme directly determines both the informativeness of these signals and the stability of training. Along this dimension, existing approaches can be organized into two categories. Trajectory-level credit assignment. Rewards are computed solely from the final, verifiable outcome and applied uniformly across the entire trajectory, implicitly treating all intermediate steps as equal contribution. Representative works include Search-R1 [82], R1-Searcher [201], and ReSearch [22], which optimize multi-turn retrieval with simple outcome-based rewards and use retrieval-token masking to limit overfit. AutoCoA [314] internalizes Chain-ofAction agent: while its SFT stage contains step-level action triggers, its RL phase adopts trajectory-level credit assignment. ARTIST [200] unifies agentic reasoning, tool integration, and RL in single framework where the model autonomously decides when, how, and which tools to invoke; optimization relies on outcome-based RL without step-level supervision. In multimodal settings, trajectory-level supervision is likewise common: VTool-R1 [250] alternates textual reasoning with intermediate visual operations, integrates Python imageediting tool into the RL loop, and trains with accuracy-linked outcome rewards; DeepEyes [325] explores thinking with images via unified multimodal agent and emphasizes end-to-end, outcome-driven RL without cold-start SFT. Overall, trajectory-level methods are simple, scalable, and practical for large, real-world tasks. However, in long-horizon, multi-tool, multi-turn scenarios, reward sparsity and diffuse credit can weaken policy-improvement signals. Step-level credit assignment. The goal is to identify which intermediate steps or turns substantially contribute to the final outcome. In multi-turn agent RL, finer-grained credit enables targeted improvement of specific actions rather than averaging rewards across all steps. For example, RAGEN [241] shows that robust reasoning fails to emerge in multiturn agent RL without fine-grained rewards, underscoring the need for granular attribution. Several lines of work pursue finer credit in multi-turn RL: Multi-Turn-RL [296] estimates advantages directly at the turn level; SPA-RL [224] decomposes the terminal reward into J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 25 per-step progress; GiGPO [47] combines trajectoryand step-level signals without adding critic or extra sampling, significantly improving multi-turn training; StepSearch [242] frames retrieval and tool use through policy updates guided by information gain at each step, to mitigate policy drift from sparse global signals. Collectively, these methods shift reward from the terminal outcome to individual step, aligning gradients with effective actions and stabilizing training. Environment Type. Regarding tool use, feedback arising from agent-environment interactions is incorporated into the context and conditions subsequent reasoning. Because this feedback is not generated autonomously by the model and is affected by environmental noise and temporal non-stationarity, it often amplifies uncertainty in subsequent outputs. The magnitude of this uncertainty is largely determined by environmental characteristics: it tends to be lower in static or well-controlled simulated settings and substantially higher in dynamic or real-world environments. Static/simulated environments. These environments are fixed and typically preprocessed, yielding stable feedback and low noise. As result, training is more stable than in real settings. For instance, ZeroSearch [205] simulates search engine with an LLM and applies curriculum RL to progressively degraded synthetic documents, substantially reducing external API costs and stochastic noise. MaskSearch [252] develops deep research capabilities under controllednoise conditions by using an offline retriever. ReSearch [22] jointly optimizes reasoning and retrieval via RL and is commonly trained on offline or semi-online, controlled corpora. AutoCoA [314] internalizes world model to reduce reliance on real-world interactions. In aggregate, this class of methods makes pragmatic trade-off: sacrificing degree of real-world adaptivity in exchange for the benefits of lower interaction costs, more stable training, and greater reproducibility. Dynamic/real-world environments. The environments in this category evolve over time or change during interaction; feedback is unstable and can be delayed, which may destabilize training and thus necessitates additional stabilization techniques. Researchers have developed several lines of work to address these challenges, primarily focusing on either mitigating environmental noise or designing more robust training methodologies. primary strategy involves directly handling the noise and complexity of feedback from live environments. On code-oriented tasks, rStar2-Agent [192] explicitly tackles tooland environment-induced noise in the coding loop, showing that mitigating task-irrelevant disturbances improves efficiency and reliability. Similarly, to manage noise during online training with live retrieval, Search-R1 [82] couples autonomous multi-turn querying with retrievaltoken masking and outcome rewards to stabilize learning. Other approaches use intermediary modules to preprocess the environments feedback. For instance, DeepResearcher [324] introduces dedicated web-browsing agent that supplies the main agent with preprocessed, filtered, and high-quality information stream. WebDancer [249] adopts similar principle by compressing verbose and noisy web page content into concise evidence + summary format to reduce context length and interference. second line of work focuses on the training framework itself to manage the inherent instability of online interaction. SkyRL [14], for example, provides training framework for real-world tasks that uses high-throughput asynchronous parallelism to execute environments more efficiently, thereby reducing latency effects and demonstrating the feasibility of online RL for long-horizon, multi-tool tasks. Taking hybrid approach, SimpleDeepSearcher [208] synthesizes offline datasets from the real web. This strategy aims to mitigate the instability of purely online training while achieving closer match to real-world conditions than purely offline or simulated setups. J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 26 Sang et al. Overall, these methods offer stronger domain fit and closer alignment with end-use applications, but they do so at the cost of significantly higher training and engineering complexity. Beyond credit-assignment granularity and environment type, the choice of base models also critically influences the internalization of tool-use capabilities. Compared with non-reasoning base models, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) possess stronger long-horizon reasoning and planning abilities, enabling more effective acquisition of tool use under both end-to-end and modular optimization. While majority of studies integrate tools on non-reasoning base models [34, 82, 246], several recent end-to-end training studies (AutoCoA [314], WebDancer [249], SkyRL [14], etc.) have begun to explore training on more capable LRMs. For instance, ReTool [46] trains tool integration within the same tool-augmented RL framework using, respectively, non-reasoning base (Qwen2.532B-Instruct [187]) and reasoning base (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B [38]). The results show that, under matched training conditions, the reasoning base performs better, corroborating that base-model reasoning capacity enhances the learning of tool-integrated reasoning. In summary, achieving robust capability internalization in end-to-end training requires coordinated strategy that addresses three key factors: (1) the chosen granularity of credit assignment, (2) the challenges to training stability posed by the environment type, and (3) the selection of foundation model with reasoning strength and tool-use alignment appropriate for the task."

The first is credit assignment: how to reliably attribute final outcome to the specific decision steps in long action sequence. The second is environmental noise: how to maintain training stability when faced with uncertainties such as tool timeouts, inconsistent returns, and dynamic content. To address these issues, research is likely to progress along several directions. As pragmatic solution, trend has emerged toward back to modular training. By decoupling the planner from the executor, the learning of the core decision-making policy can be isolated from the noise generated by the execution layer, which has been shown to improve both sample efficiency and training stability. This can help distinguish between model decision errors and environmental interference. Within end-to-end training, the refinement is expected from coarse, trajectory-level rewards toward more granular, step-level or turn-level credit assignment. Since tool use is often multi-turn interactive process, relying solely on final outcome signal dilutes the contribution of key intermediate decisions. Methods that decompose rewards or estimate advantages at finer granularity help align the learning signal more directly with effective actions, thereby stabilizing training. Simultaneously, training environments are gradually shifting from low-cost, controllable, low-noise static simulators to dynamic real-world settings to narrow the simulation-to-reality gap. The latter provides more complex and diverse scenarios, facilitating more robust and generalizable policies.

This section conceptualizes memory as a form of\naction-oriented evidence governance: its role is not only to store information effectively but also\nto ensure that information is utilized proficiently to guide actions.

            "content": "Two primary paradigms have emerged to implement these memory functions. The first, the pipeline-based paradigm, relies on external workflows to orchestrate information. This approach uses techniques such as indexing, summarization, routing, and rule-based strategies to manage data before and after the models reasoning process. While this method offers advantages in controllability, interpretability, and ease of implementation, it is often limited by performance ceiling caused by error accumulation across modules and inflexibility in long-tail scenarios. The second, the model-native paradigm, aims to internalize memory capabilities directly within the model. This is achieved through methods like internal model editing or by integrating memoryrelated workflows into the models training process. By learning unified policy for storing, managing, and retrieving information, the model-native paradigm holds higher potential for performance but requires more substantial data, computational resources, and training stability.

Overview of long context methods for short-term memory. Method categories include: SW (Sliding Window), CS (Compression & Summarization), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), PE (Position Encoding extrapolation), LS (Long-sequence Synthesis), and AO (Attention Optimization). In practice, these two paradigms are not mutually exclusive and often coexist within real-world systems. From developmental perspective, many advancements that enabled modern agent memory did not initially target it as an explicit goal. Instead, they emerged from parallel research in system optimization and model architecture, such as KV-cache management [127, 257, 316], efficient attention mechanisms [10, 36, 294], and position encoding extrapolation [179, 203]. These foundational technologies effectively expanded the models capacity for short-term information retention. Building on this, engineering practices established the RAG paradigm as the default baseline, using external pipelines to manage knowledge [86]. The recent paradigm shift is defined by the internalization of these processes, as models learn unified policy for deciding what to store, how to manage it, and when to retrieve and utilize it through end-to-end training. To systematically review this evolution, this section divides memory into two primary layers: short-term memory and long-term memory. Our discussion of short-term memory follows its own developmental trajectory. We begin with techniques for long context, which address the fundamental challenge of processing large volumes of information within single session [10, 36, 294]. We then examine context management, more advanced capability focused on the selective organization and utilization of information to mitigate attention dilution and improve reasoning quality [7]. In contrast, the section on long-term memory reviews methods for persistently storing knowledge across sessions, either in external repository or within model parameters [17, 240, 263, 326]. Notably, since long-term memory content is typically not rewritable online, the paradigm shift in this area focuses more on internalizing retrieval and usage strategies rather than the entire storage process."

We analyze this capability across three ascending levels of difficulty:",

This is the foundational ability to accurately identify and pinpoint task-relevant information within long and potentially noisy input. Basic Reasoning. This level involves performing basic, single-step operations on one or more localized pieces of evidence, such as extraction, summarization, or straightforward logical comparisons. Complex Reasoning. The most advanced level, this requires the model to integrate multiple, often distributed, pieces of evidence to construct complete causal or logical chain for solving multi-step problems. Consequently, effectively handling long contexts requires coupling the windows physical capacity with training strategies that promote its stable use. When these mechanisms fail, systems may either overlook crucial facts or suffer from attention dilution. This can lead to an illusion of perception without actual use, phenomenon described as the Lost in the Middle problem [122]. The overview of long context methods for short-term memory is illustrated in Fig. 5. More details are summarized in Table 4. Pipeline-based methods manage long contexts by externally 5.2.1 Pipeline-based Paradigm. processing information before it is fed to the model. These modular strategies can be grouped into several method categories: Sliding Window. The sliding window approach is simple and broadly applicable baseline for managing context. Under fixed computational budget, it concatenates recent interaction segments with critical history, such as initial instructions, based on temporal or topical continuity. This method is easy to implement, computationally light, and provides predictable latency, making it suitable for tasks with strong topical continuity like dialogue or code completion. However, its limitations become apparent when relevant evidence is distant or requires cross-segment alignment, as proximity-based truncation can permanently discard key facts. In practice, this baseline is often extended with more sophisticated mechanisms, such as streaming strategies and dedicated memory controllers, which have been developed to create more dynamic and efficient systems [171, 257]. Compression and Summarization. When the context window is constrained but the history is extensive, hierarchical and selective summarization can increase information density while preserving core semantics. Traditional summarization techniques are often irreversible and produce highly abstract text, saving space at the cost of detail and traceability. To overcome this, contemporary systems increasingly construct structured evidence cards with citation anchors that point back to exact source locations. This approach effectively turns summaries into session state cache that can be decompressed on demand, technique explored in systems such as Selective Context [115] and LLMLingua [79]. During inference, the model can operate on compact summaries while retaining the ability to rapidly follow anchors to verify details, thereby maintaining interpretability and coherent reasoning chain. Retrieval-Augmented Generation. When the dialogue context far exceeds the models budget and the necessary knowledge resides in external stores, RAG dynamically constructs the working context for each turn. Compared with traditional RAG pipelines, which typically treat retrieval as stateless, per-query operation, conversational variants are session-aware: they employ query expansion to capture dialogue intent and multi-path retrieval with reranking to optimize the evidence set across turns. This approach excels at knowledge-intensive, needle-in-ahaystack problems like log analysis and technical question answering. Various frameworks have demonstrated this approach, from those employing MapReduce paradigms [69] to more advanced systems that utilize graph-based structures [43] or memory-augmented techniques [182, 213]. key J.

            "content": "Position Encoding Extrapolation. The first challenge for long-context short-term memory is that models pretrained on shorter sequences struggle to generalize to longer ones. Architectural modifications to positional encodings address this. For instance, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) [203] uses rotations to encode relative positions, which inherently improves length extrapolation. Other methods, such as Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) [179], inject distance-aware J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 32 Sang et al. penalties into attention scores to aid generalization at inference time. Subsequent refinements like YaRN [177] and LieRE [168] further stabilize behavior in the extrapolation regime. However, research has shown that these architectural changes are most effective when combined with continued training on long-sequence data. For example, UltraLLaDA [71] couples position encoding extrapolation with targeted training to extend context stability to 128K tokens for retrieval and 32K tokens for complex reasoning, demonstrating that training is critical for activating models latent long-context abilities. Long-sequence Synthesis. Expanding the context windows capacity does not automatically teach model how to use it effectively. Therefore, task-driven training curricula are central to developing this capability. These curricula often include tasks like needle-in-a-haystack extraction and cross-document reasoning, which explicitly incentivize the model to attend to distant information. Reports on large models such as Qwen2.5-1M [215] and Gemini2.5 [37] confirm that curricula aligned with real-world applications markedly improve performance on ultra-long context tasks. Training typically follows schedule of increasing difficulty, starting with shorter sequences and gradually extending the length, number of distractors, and reasoning complexity. This curriculum-centric approach functions as bridge from pipeline-based engineering to model-native capability. With sufficient training pressure, models can internalize functions once delegated to external modules like retrievers and re-rankers. The result is shift away from reliance on external workflows and toward robust, end-to-end long-context reasoning. Attention Optimization. The quadratic computational cost of the standard self-attention mechanism makes processing very long sequences prohibitively expensive. This has spurred the development of more efficient attention algorithms. Algorithmic methods reduce this cost through sparse connectivity patterns, as seen in models like Longformer [10] and BigBird [294], or through linear and kernelized approximations such as the Performer [29]. In parallel, systems-level optimizations focus on improving hardware utilization. notable example is FlashAttention [36], which preserves exact attention while reducing high-bandwidth memory access through kernel fusion. This line of work has been extended by subsequent improvements like Lightning Attention [307, 308]. Additional cache-aware and shape-adaptive variants further refine attention allocation to better match task structure [40, 156]. Together, these advances are shifting long-context capabilities from an exotic feature to practical default, providing solid substrate for higher-level algorithms and applications."

In single-agent systems, context management prioritizes evidence selection for single model, whereas in multi-agent systems, it must also handle inter-agent messaging, role-conditioned retrieval, and shared memory. We further divide the progression toward full internalization into two distinct stages: the hybrid paradigm and the fully model-native paradigm. It reflects the difference between learning to operate components within system versus the model becoming the system itself. The hybrid paradigm represents transitional stage where pipeline-based architectures are retained, but individual rule-based modules are replaced with learnable components (modular optimization), or the model is trained to execute predefined external workflow (workflow internalization). In contrast, the fully model-native paradigm eliminates this external scaffolding entirely, internalizing the entire memory management process into single, unified policy learned end-to-end.

For specialized domains, hierarchical organization may be used to manage complex evidence and resolve conflicts, as demonstrated by HiAgent and AWM [76, 240]. Retrieval and Routing. When evidence is drawn from heterogeneous sources, retrieval and routing becomes critical.

Production systems like ZEP and Mem0 further integrate joint sparse-dense retrieval for fast and semantically faithful recall [28, 299]. While controllable and auditable, the rigidity of these rule-based policies limits their adaptability, motivating shift toward hybrid, learnable approaches."

            "content": "Context Re-structuring. In the hybrid paradigm, context re-structuring evolves from simple information arrangement to dynamic knowledge construction [240]. representative technique is the use of learned memory slots, where lightweight policy network learns to distill and write key information into structured, finite set of slots rather than passively receiving raw text [231, 263, 293]. Another approach uses fine-tuned model to create associations between disparate pieces of knowledge, effectively synthesizing new, structured evidence. Systems such as EMU, Optimus-1, and Nemori illustrate this synthesis-oriented restructuring [159, 218, 284], which has been shown to significantly improve reasoning performance [28, 263]. Retrieval and Routing. Retrieval and routing in the hybrid paradigm aim to replace fixed rules with learned policies to enhance adaptability. The evolution proceeds mainly along two paths. The first path is modular optimization, which retains the classic pipeline structure but replaces individual rule-based components (e.g., retriever or re-ranker) with trainable neural modules. This improves performance on specific tasks while maintaining the overall architectures interpretability, as exemplified by RAP, SeCom, M+, TWM, RCR-Router, and Learn-to-Memorize [17, 44, 173, 186, 235, 315]. The second path is workflow internalization, towards deeper integration. The LLM is trained to execute the steps of predefined workflow, learning to decide when to retrieve, rewrite, or evaluate information. Self-RAG, for instance, introduced reflection tokens that allow the model to trigger retrieval and self-critique its generated content based on the results [7]. Related approaches like TiM, HippoRAG, MemAgent, and Memory-R1 similarly entwine selection and synthesis within the models decision-making process, improving adaptability while preserving auditability through explicit step definitions [222, 265, 266, 278]."

Systems like Scissorhands and H2O exemplify this dynamic cache management [127, 316]. Another direction couples model parameterization with external memory, allowing memory operations to be tied to model weights while remaining grounded in an auditable store, as seen in MEM1 and H-MEM [206, 327]. In all cases, restructuring moves from an external pre-processing step to an intrinsic, policy-driven behavior during inference. Retrieval and Routing.

When using external repositories, the emphasis shifts from how to store information to how to retrieve it precisely and use it reliably [12, 78]. common practice is to build hybrid indexes offline by combining inverted indices, dense vectors, and metadata. During inference, multi-path retrieval and re-ranking are used to select and compress candidate evidence. This process is often accompanied by deduplication and consistency checks to ensure the injected evidence is both relevant and traceable [170, 323]. While this approach is robust for tasks requiring deep knowledge from large corpora, injecting excessive or poorly selected information can dilute the models attention. Consequently, recent methods have moved from single-path semantic retrieval toward more complex pipelines that incorporate learned re-ranking and delegate decisions about when and what to retrieve to learned policies [41]. Structure and Compressed Summarization. Because long-term knowledge sources are often lengthy and heterogeneous, simply expanding the context window is not always effective. Layered summarization and structuring are therefore used to manage information density. Documents can be segmented into structured evidence cards with explicit citations and timestamps for verifiability. This structured layer reduces noise and stabilizes the candidate pool for retrieval systems [170, 175]. The focus has shifted from generating human-readable text summaries to creating machine-usable evidence objects that integrate tightly with retrieval and routing strategies [41, 78]."

In practice, this is often achieved through continual pretraining or instruction distillation, where domain-specific knowledge, API schemas, or reasoning patterns are integrated into the training data. Data replay and regularization techniques are used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. This allows the internalized knowledge to serve as fallback when external retrieval fails or returns incomplete information [12, 78, 319]. J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

When small number of critical facts need to be corrected or updated, model editing offers more targeted approach. Representative methods apply lowrank adjustments to specific layers or intermediate representations, allowing for the injection or replacement of target knowledge with minimal disruption to the models overall capabilities [151, 152, 154]. This method is effective for sparse, important factual corrections but is not suitable for large-scale knowledge migration. In practice, this has evolved from single edits to batch pipelines that can be triggered by upstream changes in an authoritative source, enabling near real-time corrections [154]. Lightweight Parameter Injection. To balance the high cost of global internalization with the limited capacity of model editing, lightweight modules can be used. This strategy involves freezing the base model and training or attaching small, specialized components that carry specific knowledge. LoRA-style adapters and adapter banks can encode user preferences or task-specific skills in compact modules, while linear state layers can provide additional internal memory that is routed on per-input basis [39, 98, 101, 196, 234]. This approach is computationally efficient and allows for per-task or per-domain customization. J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Sang et al."

This trend reframes memory from a simple information\nstorage mechanism into a system for action-oriented evidence governance, responsible for preserv-\ning state, retrieving information, and injecting it into the agent’s reasoning process. This shift from\npipeline-based to model-native solutions is particularly evident in short-term memory.",
            "content": "Short-term memory was initially developed to compensate for models limited context processing abilities. Early pipeline-based approaches, such as MemoChat [45], used structured templates and decomposable modules to filter and arrange evidence before it reached the model. While interpretable and easy to implement, these systems were limited by cross-module error accumulation and inflexibility, casting the model as passive participant. As native context windows have expanded, the focus has shifted from mere capacity to effective context management. The challenge is no longer how much information can be processed, but how well the model can filter noise, locate critical evidence, and utilize it for complex reasoning. This has driven the evolution from coarse-grained pipelines to more intelligent, learned policies. This transition is not an abrupt replacement but gradual process of internalizing validated pipeline functions into the models native abilities. key bottleneck in this path lies in longsequence data synthesis and curriculum design. Future breakthroughs will likely involve training models to endogenously learn operations like retrieval, compression, and verification as explicit objectives [12, 78, 319]. As models learn attention mechanisms akin to retriever and resource allocation strategies similar to router [44], external modules like vector stores will recede from online decision-making. Their role will shift to serving as backend infrastructure for compliance, persistent storage, and offline content preparation, supporting the models native governance capabilities. Long-term memory began primarily as external repositories, with engineering practices emphasizing traceability, control, and governance. Retrieval relied on cascaded re-ranking [86], but this design faced two key limitations: the content was not rewritable online, and there was often mismatch between retrieved relevance and actual utility in the reasoning chain [7]. key recent trend is personalization, where long-term memory evolves from unified knowledge warehouse into dynamic, user-specific asset composed of traceable evidence cards [170, 175]. second trend is the deepening coupling with short-term memory. Although most long-term stores are not yet fully model-native due to their offline nature, methods are emerging that blur this boundary. This includes co-training the retriever and generator to improve evidence utilization [78, 309], using online updates to write back critical facts, and employing lightweight adapters to inject knowledge into model parameters [234]. Systems like Mem0 [28] sit at this intersection, combining the governability of external memory with the fast read-write capabilities needed for session-level adaptation, pointing toward an eventual unification of long-term and short-term memory systems. In summary, several key trends are shaping the future of memory-enhanced agents: Benchmark evolution: evaluation will move beyond raw capacity toward stringent reasoning benchmarks that stress-test long-range dependency, interference robustness, and logical closure. Capability internalization and unification: the internalization of capabilities will continue, with the progressive unification of short-term and long-term memory into model-native skills and the default co-training of retrieval and generation components. Personalization with stronger governance: long-term memory will become highly personalized and dynamic, increasing need for stronger governance, privacy controls, and user-facing correction to ensure consistency and reliability.

            "content": "The pipeline-based paradigm provides controllable and interpretable workflows, supporting debugging and updates at any stage, which makes it well-suited for industrial deployment. However, it depends on predefined, prompt-driven procedures that demand substantial manual design. The performance of such systems is constrained by the models instruction-following capability, longhorizon reasoning stability, and sensitivity to prompt formulation, making them less reliable for complex reasoning tasks. In contrast, the core idea of model-native methods is to internalize search strategies into model parameters through reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end autonomous research capability. This paradigm enhances long-horizon reasoning consistency and allows the model to dynamically adapt to diverse search contexts. From the perspective of reasoning consistency, internalizing strategies at the parametric level leverages stored knowledge to preserve goal and evidence coherence across multiple turns [202], thereby improving reasoning stability and reducing phenomena such as goal drift, lost-in-conversation, and information forgetting in extended prompt chains [93, 122, 239]. With respect to adaptability, the model dynamically adjusts retrieval depth and evidence integration according to task complexity, without relying on predefined workflows, thereby reducing unnecessary tool calls, redundant information retrieval, and overall token costs [82]. By shifting from external orchestration to internalized capability, this paradigm ensures stable reasoning across diverse environments and task structures, enhancing the generalization of Deep Research agents to open-domain, multi-hop, and unstructured evidence tasks. The pipeline-based and model-native approaches differ fundamentally in implementation but converge in their evolution toward more autonomous, efficient, and adaptive research processes, exhibiting consistent trends across key dimensions such as information acquisition, task objectives, base model design, and agent architecture. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 6.1.2 introduces the pipeline-based paradigm; Section 6.1.3 presents the model-native paradigm; and Section 6.1.4 compares their evolutionary patterns and discusses future directions of Deep Research agents. Pipeline-based methods enable retrieval-augmented knowl6.1.2 Pipeline-based Paradigm . edge integration and multi-turn reasoning through carefully designed prompt templates and orchestrated tool chains. Two main implementation paths exist: (1) single-turn retrieval and synthesis, exemplified by RAG [97], which optimizes the retrieveintegrategenerate pipeline; and (2) multiturn reasoningaction cycles, exemplified by ReAct [277], which integrates retrieval into iterative reasoning, allowing models to decide when and what to retrieve through thinkretrieverethink process. Single-turn Retrieval and Synthesis. Single-turn retrieval and synthesis methods perform one-shot retrieval and generation, introducing external knowledge into LLM reasoning to address the limitations of static, parameterized memory. These methods typically follow two-stage process: J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 40 Sang et al. Fig. 7. Overview of deep research agent methods. query enhancement and evidence processing. During the first phase, the model or its external components construct or rewrite task-specific queries to retrieve candidate evidence from search engines, vector databases, or knowledge bases. Subsequently, the retrieved content is filtered, compressed, and structurally organized to preserve essential and relevant context, which is then injected into the models context for answer synthesis or report generation [85]. The two stages are elaborated in detail below. Query enhancement. Query enhancement improves retrieval effectiveness by rewriting, expanding, or constructing task-specific queries [236], thereby increasing retrieval quality and answerability. Query2doc [232] prompts an LLM in few-shot manner to generate pseudo-documents, which are concatenated with the original query for search, effectively expanding query scope. Ma et al. [143] introduce query rewriting framework for RAG, where an LLM or lightweight model first rewrites the query, retrieves results via the Bing API, and then passes the retrieved content to reader model for final generation. FreshLLMs [221] focus on time-sensitive knowledge by combining multiple evidence sources with structured metadata, and guide attention according to temporal order. Jin et al. [83] present BIDER, which improves retrieval coverage and matching accuracy through bidirectional expansion of both documents and queries from the index side. Evidence processing. To ensure that retrieved information is relevant, concise, and structurally coherent before being injected into the model context, evidence processing refines and organizes raw retrieval outputs. Xu et al. [261] propose RECOMP, which introduces compression layer prior to injection, combining extractive and abstractive compressors that can selectively omit uninformative content. Jiang et al. [80] develop LongLLMLingua, applying global reranking and span-level extraction to mitigate context explosion. Vu et al. [221] normalize search results into structured evidence lists for more consistent integration. Li et al.

Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 41 enabling continuous accumulation and reuse of retrieved evidence. Edge et al. [42] proposed GraphRAG that replace scattered documents with knowledge graphs and community summaries, supporting path-level interpretability and global evidence aggregation. Multi-turn Reasoning-Action . To overcome the limitations of single turn retrieval and synthesis, including insufficient evidence, hallucinations, and error propagation, multi turn reasoning and action methods introduce iterative retrieval within closed reasoning loop. Yao et al. [277] propose ReAct, representative framework that interleaves reasoning and acting, forming feedback process where reasoning guides actions and observations refine subsequent reasoning. This paradigm enhances reasoning reliability through two key mechanisms: the orchestration of reasoning and retrieval, which enables iterative evidence acquisition, and context management with evidence refinement, which maintains focus and reduces noise accumulation. Building on this foundation, recent studies have advanced these two mechanisms through various designs and optimization strategies, as detailed below. Orchestration of reasoning and retrieval. This line of work focuses on coordinating reasoning and retrieval to iteratively accumulate relevant evidence. He et al. [72], Gur et al. [65], and Alzubi et al. [5] develop agents that solve tasks step by step, repeatedly invoking search tools and feeding textual observations or web snapshots back into the reasoning process. Li et al. [110] propose Search o1, which employs large reasoning model without handcrafted templates and introduces Reason in Documents mechanism that orchestrates pause, retrieve, and resume operations for retrieval augmented answering. Context management and evidence refinement. Managing large amounts of retrieved information is essential to preserve reasoning coherence and reduce redundancy. He et al. [72] prune historical context, retaining only the three most recent observations and the complete reasoning trace to maintain recency and relevance. Gur et al. [65] train HTML T5 to handle long HTML documents using hybrid local and global attention with long span denoising pretraining, extending input length and context window during fine tuning. Li et al. [110] design an in document reasoning and refinement module that compresses retrieved content and reinjects only the most relevant knowledge. Alzubi et al. [5] adopt chunking and reranking, segmenting web pages into paragraph level chunks and keeping only those above relevance threshold. Wu et al. [253] mitigate information overload through periodic context summarization, which removes redundant content while preserving key evidence, enabling continuous exploration."

Such designs ensure reproducibility and avoid issues commonly encountered in online environments, including network instability, API rate limitations, and unpredictable web responses. However, the static and bounded nature of local datasets constrains the scope of knowledge and limits exposure to real-time information. As result, models trained exclusively offline may struggle with information obsolescence and reduced generalization in open environments. To overcome these limitations, ZeroSearch [205] introduces simulated search engine that uses an LLM-generated document space to emulate online retrieval. This approach maintains controllable training dynamics while approximating the variability of real web search, achieving balance between data freshness, quality, and stability. Online Training . Online training situates model learning within real-world, connected environments, allowing agents to retrieve and reason over dynamic and continuously updated information sources. This paradigm provides direct access to the open web, enabling models to acquire real-time knowledge and effectively extend their informational coverage beyond static corpora. DeepResearcher [324] demonstrates large-scale reinforcement learning in live web environments, where agents interact directly with search engines and webpages during training. Following this direction, WebThinker [112], WebWatcher [54], SFR-DeepResearch [161], MMSearch-R1 [247], and DeepDive [132] perform end-to-end reinforcement learning under realistic web settings, where model actions directly determine query formulation, browsing behaviors, and document reasoning. Although online training captures the complexity of open-world information retrieval, it also introduces significant engineering and optimization challenges. Factors such as network fluctuations, page latency, API quotas, anti-crawling mechanisms, and advertisement noise can disrupt the learning signal and escalate computational costs. Building robust and scalable online training pipelines therefore requires careful system design, adaptive control strategies, and efficient reward shaping to ensure stability and performance in dynamic environments."

To handle more specialized information needs, WebResearcher [184] integrates multiple APIs, including Google Search and Google Scholar, and uses dedicated summarization model to process the results. Another line of research prioritizes reproducibility and training stability by using static databases, such as Wikipedia dump, as the external knowledge source. This controlled environment allows for more rigorous evaluation of an agents reasoning and retrieval strategies without the noise and non-stationarity of the open web. Representative works in this category include Search-R1 [82], ReSearch [22], R-Search [320], and the R1-Searcher series [201, 202]. M2IO-R1 [259] further adapts this approach for multimodal scenarios by J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 44 Sang et al. retrieving from pre-constructed database of text-image pairs. To bridge the gap between static and live environments, ZeroSearch [205] introduces novel training strategy where an LLM is used to simulate search engine, generating both relevant and noisy documents. This allows the agent to be trained with curriculum-based difficulty, improving robustness while avoiding the high cost and instability of live API calls. Browser-based methods. Complementary to API-based approaches, browser-based methods enable more human-like web interaction through automated browser control, supporting dynamic page rendering, element interaction, and the handling of complex web scenarios. Related methods can be distinguished by their level of abstraction. Some works focus on the low-level mechanics of direct browser interaction. For example, WebVoyager [72] renders HTML into visual web pages and interacts with elements using combination of textual information and screenshots. This allows it to handle dynamic elements like floating advertisements, thereby improving robustness in real-world web environments. Other approaches operate at higher level of abstraction, focusing on information and workflow management. DeepResearcher [324] invokes dedicated browsing agent to sequentially read and extract relevant information, managing short-term memory to condense the information before returning it to the main agent. Similarly, WebThinker [112] uses an auxiliary LLM to summarize crawled pages based on the agents click intent, and in its report generation mode, stores explored pages in document memory for later retrieval. Finally, some frameworks represent hybrid approach; DeepDive [132], for instance, abstracts browser interactions into set of discrete function calls like (𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ, 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑘, 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛), combining the direct control of browser-based methods with the structured nature of API-based invocation. Task Objectives . According to the goal of information research, Deep Research agents can be broadly divided into two categories: definitive answering and generative synthesis. Definitive answering. This category focuses on concise, verifiable factual questions that emphasize rapid information localization and multi-hop verification.Representative works such as WebVoyager [72], Real-World WebAgent [65], Search-o1 [110], ODS [5], and SearchR1 [82] effectively employ single-hop or multi-hop search strategies to locate precise answers to user queries. Generative synthesis. This category addresses complex, open-ended tasks that require integrating multiple sources of evidence and constructing coherent arguments around thematic questions. Such works often employ multimodal or structured representationssuch as tables and imagesto enhance information density and presentation quality. WebThinker [112] generates research-style reports incorporating Markdown-formatted tables for structured summarization. M2IO-R1 [259] produces interleaved textimage outputs, combining retrieved multimodal content with contextual reasoning. SFR-DeepResearch [161] supports long-form report generation, synthesizing retrieved knowledge into extended, well-organized documents. Base Models . Across both pipeline-based and model-native paradigms, Deep Research agents have evolved in base model design, from LLMs to LRMs and further to LMMs. Pipeline-based methods rely on LLMs or LRMs guided by explicit prompting frameworks (e.g., ReAct), while modelnative approaches use reinforcement learning to internalize reasoning and retrieval. With the emergence of reasoning-optimized LRMs such as OpenAI-o1 [166] and DeepSeek-R1 [38], models J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI increasingly integrate tool use within their architecture. To handle multimodal environments, LMMs extend these capabilities to images, webpages, and videos, enabling richer evidence acquisition. LLM. Search-R1 [82], R1-Searcher [201], ReSearch [22], R-Search [320] utilize single LLM that, after reinforcement learning for deep research work, becomes an LRM that internalizes tool usage mastery, responsible for completing the entire process of reasoning, generating search queries, understanding retrieval results, and generating answers. LRM. Search-o1 [110] enables the model to autonomously decide when to retrieve and refine documents into compact knowledge steps that support current reasoning. WebThinker [112] performs end-to-end reasoning, invoking tools such as search, navigation, and report generation within its reasoning chain. SFR-DeepResearch [161] and DeepDive [132] adopt multiple reasoning-optimized LRMs as their core base models. LMM. Multimodal extensions further enhance Deep Research capabilities. WebVoyager [72] defaults to gpt-4-vision-preview model. MMSearch-R1 [247] uses three types of LMMs. Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct serves as the policy model, learning to execute on-demand search through RL training. Qwen3-32B serves as the webpage summarization model for content summarization in text search pipelines. GPT-4o serves as the judge model for evaluating model response accuracy. WebWatcher [54] uses two types of LMMs. Qwen2.5-VL-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-32B serve as policy models trained through SFT and RL. GPT-4o serves as an auxiliary model for data generation, trajectory annotation, and evaluation. M2IO-R1 [259] uses Qwen2.5-VL series for image insertion tasks, with GPT-4o for text answer generation and auxiliary data construction. Agent Architectures . Whether in pipeline-based or model-native paradigms, Deep Research Agents have developed along two architectural lines: single-agent and multi-agent. Single-agent systems integrate planning, retrieval, reasoning, and generation within one model, featuring simplicity, efficiency, and low cost. In contrast, multi-agent architectures assign specialized roles such as planning, retrieval, summarization, and writing to multiple collaborating models, improving scalability, robustness, and adaptability for complex, long-horizon, or multimodal tasks. Single-agent architecture. Single-agent architectures unify planning, retrieval, comprehension, and generation within one model, achieving end-to-end execution with minimal computational overhead and shorter training pipeline. Search-R1 [82], R1-Searcher [201], and ReSearch [22] follow this pattern, using single LLM trained through reinforcement learning to perform reasoning, generate search queries, interpret retrieved content, and produce final answers. Such an approach is well suited to factual or task-specific applications. Multi-agent architecture. Compared with single agents that are limited by context capacity and role overload in complex reasoning, multi-agent architectures distribute specialized roles such as planning, retrieval, summarization, and writing to enhance scalability, robustness, and overall performance. Real-World WebAgent [65] separates planning and summarization using HTML-T5, while Flan-U-PaLM generates executable programs, improving coordination and efficiency. DeepResearcher [324] employs Web Browsing Agent for segmented retrieval and summarization, reducing context load on the main agent while preserving essential information for reasoning. ReSum [253] integrates reasoning policy model with summarization tool that compresses historical context when limits are reached, enabling continuous exploration. WebThinker [112] assigns its main LRM to reasoning and planning, and an auxiliary LLM to search intent generation, content summarization, and report composition, improving logical coherence. R1-Searcher++ [202] adopts dual-model collaboration during reinforcement learning, where rewrite model transforms retrieved J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 46 Sang et al. documents into internal reasoning paths, allowing the policy model to internalize external knowledge and reduce retrieval frequency without compromising accuracy. Reward Design . Beyond the common trends shared by both pipeline-based and modelnative paradigms, reward design in reinforcement learning is mechanism unique to the latter. It determines whether models can internalize retrieval and reasoning strategieswhen to search, how to filter evidence, and how to generate reliable results. Through fine-grained reward shaping, model-native approaches transform externally guided behaviors into self-regulated reasoning capabilities. Existing studies mainly explore three types of reward signals: outcome, format, and process rewards. Outcome rewards. Outcome rewards assess only the final result, encouraging correct outputs without considering intermediate reasoning quality. DeepSeek-R1 [38] demonstrates that outcome rewards alone can effectively guide reasoning. Similarly, Search-R1 [82], ZeroSearch [205], and SFR-DeepResearch [161] adopt simple outcome-based supervision. Format rewards. Format rewards ensure structural correctness within reasoning chains, aligning thinking steps, tool calls, and outputs. R1-Searcher [201], ReSearch [22], DeepResearcher [324], WebWatcher [54], and M2IO-R1 [259] constrain models to wrap reasoning, retrieval, and final answers within predefined tags. DeepDive [132] further applies strict binary reward that requires both correct format and correct answer simultaneously. Process rewards. Process rewards provide stepwise feedback, guiding models to balance reasoning depth, efficiency, and traceability. R1-Searcher++ [202] combines format, outcome, and group rewards, encouraging accurate answers with minimal retrievals. R-Search [320] extends this approach with multi-stage reward mechanisms to jointly optimize reasoning quality and resource efficiency. Future Directions . Building on the evolutionary framework of Deep Research agents, we identify key challenges and outline future research trajectories. These directions collectively aim to advance agents from instruction-following tools to intelligent research partners that understand problems, explore knowledge boundaries, and co-evolve with humans. Information acquisition. Agents should dynamically choose acquisition strategiesusing APIs for structured, time-sensitive queries and browsers for interactive, multimodal scenarios. Emerging AI-native browsers (e.g., Browserbase, Browser Use, Perplexitys Comet) are narrowing this gap by providing stable DOM access, asynchronous execution, and automated anti-scraping, bringing browser-based methods closer to API-level reliability. Task objectives. Future research may progress in three directions: (1) Interactive research with user feedback loops to refine intent and deepen exploration; (2) Continuous Living Research for persistent topic tracking and periodic incremental reporting; (3) Predictive analysis that anticipates future trends and potential breakthroughs from historical data. Agent architecture. Agents should assess task complexity, evaluate interdependencies, and autonomously decide between serial or parallel collaboration. This can be achieved by modeling workflows as mutable graphs and optimizing them through evolutionary or adaptive algorithms. Reward design. Incorporating curiosity-driven and self-reward mechanisms [176, 289] can encourage exploration and self-assessment. Intrinsic rewards promote uncertainty reduction, while self-evaluation reduces reliance on external supervision. J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.

            "content": "Early GUI automation relied on pipeline-based paradigm, initially driven by system-based workflows like record-and-replay [9, 64] or rule-based scripts [2, 108]. While stable for repetitive tasks, the hard-coded system workflow lacked the necessary understanding of interface semantics and user intent. The advent of LLMs introduced prompt-based methods, replacing rigid scripts with natural language instructions and enabling agents like AppAgent [300] and Mobile-Agent [229] to exhibit preliminary degree of autonomy. However, these agents still operated within manually orchestrated frameworks, invoking LLMs as external tools that were not specifically optimized for the nuances of GUI interaction, thus failing to fully leverage their inherent potential. To overcome these limitations, current research is progressively moving towards the model-native paradigm, which internalizes the core capabilities of GUI agent within the models parameters. This transition has progressed along path of increasing integration, beginning with modular training. This approach solved critical bottlenecks by individually training components, such as the perception-focused models in UGround [59] and Aria-UI [273], or by fusing modules as seen in CogAgent [75]. This evolutionary path is ultimately leading toward end-to-end training, where one single model learns the direct mapping from perceptual inputs to executable actions. This fully integrated approach, demonstrated by recent methods like UI-TARS [185] and GUI-owl [279] significantly enhances an agents autonomy and generalization, allowing it to move beyond its dependency on external frameworks. An overview of GUI Agent methods is illustrated in Fig. 8. In their early development, GUI Agents primarily relied 6.2.2 Pipeline-based Paradigm. on manually orchestrated pipelines that decomposed tasks into fixed modules linked by explicit logic. Within this framework, models were assigned only limited functions at specific steps of the process. Based on the autonomy of the agents decision-making, the pipeline paradigm can be further divided into two sub-stages: system-based and prompt-based. The former, corresponding to the traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) paradigm, relies on record-and-playback or J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 48 Sang et al. rule-based scripts to replay fixed sequence of operations. The latter utilizes prompts to drive LLMs to autonomously handle functions such as task understanding, planning, and tool calling to complete GUI task. System-based Workflows. In the early development of GUI Agents, models did not yet have the ability to perceive interface states or make independent decisions. Consequently, automation relied on system-level orchestration to reproduce human operations in fixed environments, aiming for greater efficiency and repeatability. According to the control method, this stage can be divided into two types: record-and-replay and rule-based scripting automation. Record-and-replay. This class of methods achieves task automation by recording users action sequence (e.g. clicks and inputs) and replaying it verbatim within an identical environment. For instance, CoScripter[96] first proposed method for users to record actions directly within web browser, which could then be replayed as scripts to enable the automation and sharing of web-based workflows. Subsequently, RERAN[57] extended this concept to mobile platforms, achieving high-precision touch replay by capturing low-level Linux input events. To improve robustness, subsequent research introduced more intelligent matching and waiting mechanisms. Ringer[9], for example, enhanced replay success rates across different website versions by recording multi-dimensional attributes of UI elements and calculating their similarity during the replay phase. It could also automatically insert wait conditions to handle asynchronous scenarios. In the mobile domain, SARA[64] introduced adaptive replay and context-capturing mechanisms, enabling recorded scripts to be executed across heterogeneous devices. Although these improvements enhanced the environmental adaptability of the scripts, this approach still depended on fixed environments and specific examples. Consequently, it suffered from poor generalization and was unable to support open-ended tasks. Rule-based scripting. To overcome the brittleness of record-and-replay methods and to support more complex and stable automation, the research community shifted towards rulebased scripting. This approach involves controlling the operational logic of an agent through explicit rules or conditional statements. For example, Chickenfoot[11] pioneered the use of natural language-like JavaScript to manipulate web elements, which enabled users to control tasks through semantic commands such as click(login). Subsequently, Sikuli[282] advanced this approach by using screenshot matching instead of coordinate-based positioning, making scripts more robust against layout changes. As this technology progressed towards industrial applications, the research focus shifted to automating and enhancing the intelligence of rule-based scripts. SmartRPA[2], for instance, proposed automatically synthesizing rule-based scripts from user interface logs to reduce manual effort. Meanwhile, Sugilite[108] explored collaborative human-computer programming paradigm that combined voice and demonstration, allowing end-users to generate conditional scripts from natural language instructions. While rule-based scripting offered greater flexibility and degree of logical control compared to record-and-replay, it was still critically constrained by its lack of perceptual and semantic understanding capabilities. In summary, the system-based workflow is defined by its reliance on deterministic control through either explicit rules or direct action replay. This approach offered high stability and interpretability but was ultimately limited by its lack of semantic understanding and its inability to generalize to novel tasks. J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 49 Prompt-based Methods. With the advent of LLMs, the research focus for GUI Agents shifted from scripted execution to language-driven decision generation. This prompt-based stage leverages the in-context learning capabilities of pre-trained LLM, using prompts to guide the model in understanding task instructions, parsing interface states, and generating action plans without requiring additional training. This transition enabled agents to adapt to multi-platform GUI environments using unified language interface, thereby achieving preliminary form of generality. As work in this area progressed to enhance the coherence and reliability of planning, four primary developmental paths emerged: Single-step reactive agents. Early prompt-based GUI agents often adopted single-step reactive approach, where the agent generates and executes single action immediately following each observation of the interface. The ReAct framework [277] pioneered this by having an LLM generate Thought and an Action in each round, enabling zero-shot completion of tasks in text-based environments like ALFWorld. Building on this, AutoGUI[317] constructed multimodal context that included action history to inform its singlestep decisions. This concept was further adapted to mobile platforms by MobileAgent [229], which concatenates screenshots, OCR information, and user instructions into multimodal prompt. This process allows the agent to produce short-term reasoning and an action at each step, achieving low-latency reactive operations. However, significant limitation of purely reactive methods is their lack of global plan, which can lead to inefficient looping behaviors or failure to address the overall task objective. Hierarchical planning agents. To address the limitations of purely reactive methods, researchers introduced the hierarchical planning paradigm. In this paradigm, the agent first generates high-level, global plan and then executes it, with the ability to dynamically modify sub-plans. For instance, WebAgent [66] employs three-stage process where an LLM first decomposes task, program synthesizer converts the plan into script, and the script is then executed. In the mobile domain, the MobileAgent-v2 [228] series extended this concept into multi-agent, layered architecture where high-level planner summarizes task progress to guide separate low-level decision-making agent. Such hierarchical structures compensate for the lack of global control found in reactive strategies. However, their reliance on pre-defined plans can limit their ability to generalize across platforms or to correct errors during execution. Reflective agents. This approach introduces self-evaluation and correction loop, enabling the agent to identify and rectify its own errors. The Reflexion [197] framework allows an agent to analyze task failures and store these reflections in memory to avoid repeating mistakes, which has been shown to improve success rates. Similarly, the RCI [87] framework demonstrated increased accuracy in GUI form-filling tasks by incorporating self-correction mechanism. In mobile scenarios, Mobile-Agent-V [230] achieves self-correction through fusion of visual backtracking and linguistic reflection, reviewing past demonstration videos to evaluate its actions and generate improvement strategies. Exploratory agents. In contrast to the post-execution error correction of reflective agents, exploratory agents proactively generate and evaluate multiple candidate paths via simulation or search before selecting the optimal one for execution. The Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) [276] framework, for example, extends the LLMs reasoning process into tree structure, enabling parallel reasoning and self-evaluation to prune less promising paths at critical decision points. AppAgent [300] improves stability by leveraging knowledge base built during an initial, task-agnostic exploration phase. Furthering this idea, MobileGPT [95] combined exploratory J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 50 Sang et al. decision-making with hierarchical memory to enable long-term knowledge accumulation, demonstrating improved generalization and stability in zero-shot, cross-application scenarios. The prompt-based methods demonstrated the potential of using LLMs for GUI agent tasks, freeing them from the constraints of manual scripting and enabling zero-shot completion of complex tasks via natural language. However, this paradigm also revealed significant limitations: (1) perceptual constraints, due to reliance on textual descriptions of the GUI; (2) insufficient state tracking, because of limited context windows; and (3) high inference costs from multi-round reflection and exploration. These collectively motivated the research community to advance toward the model-native paradigm, with the aim of improving representational stability and generalization through direct model training."

            "content": "To overcome the limitations of the pipeline-based approaches, research has shifted toward the model-native paradigm, which aims to internalize core GUI agent capabilities into the models parameters through data-driven training. These capabilities can be trained either individually or jointly, leading to the development along two primary paths distinguished by their degree of integration: modular training and end-to-end training. Modular Training. Modular training serves as critical transitional stage between pipelinebased systems and fully end-to-end learning. In this approach, the complex GUI interaction process is decomposed into several learnable functional components such as perception, planning, and execution, which are trained either independently or in partially coupled manner. This methodology enhances interpretability and data efficiency by allowing individual capabilities to mature under targeted supervision before their eventual integration. To provide clearer overview of development in this stage, we categorize the related work into three main directions: Foundational modules: perception and execution. In the initial phase of modular training, research focused on establishing the agents fundamental interaction loop, which consists of perception, planning, and execution. In this loop, the perception module analyzes the structure and semantic elements of the graphical interface; the planning module decomposes high-level user goals into sub-tasks and generates executable steps; and the execution module maps these abstract plans into concrete actions. Early work on the perception module focused on parsing the screen into structured elements. For instance, OmniParser[133] converts screen content into readable bounding boxes and semantic labels. Subsequent research began to focus more specifically on grounding. UGround[59] trained universal GUI grounding model on large-scale dataset consisting of 1.3 million screenshots and tens of millions of UI elements. Further advancing this work, AriaUI[273] achieved purely visual grounding across diverse instruction formats and in dynamic contexts, setting new state-of-the-art results on multiple online agent benchmarks. More recently, research has begun to introduce reinforcement learning paradigms into perception training. For example, SE-GUI[291] utilized self-evolving fine-tuning with dense, point-level rewards through GRPO to stably improve localization robustness. Overall, this line of research has collectively established stable correlation: improvements in the performance of the grounding-centric perception module are consistently linked to higher overall task success rates. Research in planning module follows two main approaches: imitative and generative planning. Imitative planning learns from expert demonstrations. For instance, CoAT[303] makes the chain of action and chain of thought explicit for supervised fine-tuning, enhancing interpretability and robustness. Similarly, WebAgent[66] constructs modular pipeline to J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 51 normalize and orchestrate natural language instructions. In contrast, generative planning enables agents to create plans more autonomously. WMA-Agent[15], for example, allows the planner to imagine before deciding by learning the environments dynamics, showing performance gains on benchmarks like WebArena. Another approach, WebSynthesis[52], uses world model with MCTS to synthesize high-quality training trajectories, thereby augmenting its policy learning process. Execution modules can be divided into two categories based on their action space: atomiclevel and widget-level executors. Atomic-level executors decode primitive, coordinate-based actions like click and type, focusing on precision and reliability. Research in this area includes UI-R1[134], which enhanced atomic action accuracy using rule-based rewards; and OSKairos[27], which enhances the robustness of its atomic-level actions by jointly optimizing for confidence estimation. Widget-level executors, in contrast, perform semantic selection on UI elements to align with human intent. For instance, WEPO[121] used preference learning to reduce selection errors caused by element ambiguity. In summary, the two executor types offer clear trade-off. Atomic-level executors provide high precision and generality but are vulnerable to perceptual noise and lack semantic context. Conversely, widget-level executors align well with human intent and offer better generalization, but they depend on high-quality perception and struggle with fine-grained operations. Advanced modules: reflection and exploration. As foundational perception and execution capabilities matured, the research focus shifted to higher-level agentic capabilities to self-assess, self-correct, and proactively explore. The reflection module helps the model identify and correct erroneous decisions through continuous evaluation and feedback on the execution process. In parallel, the exploration module is responsible for autonomously generating high-quality interaction data to support continuous learning and generalization. The introduction of these two module types marks the evolution of GUI Agents from passive executors into proactive entities capable of learning and adaptation. Training for the reflection module follows two main paradigms. Discriminative Reflection uses supervised signals to judge the correctness of local actions, enabling real-time selfchecking and rollbacks. In contrast, Evaluative Reflection assesses entire sequences through reward modeling or preference learning to guide policy optimization. In discriminative reflection, the focus is on step-by-step verification. For instance, STEVE[129] reflects on each actions validity by using large multimodal model to verify the screen transition (previous screen, action, next screen). V-Droid[35], on the other hand, reflects by using verifier to evaluate set of candidate actions based on learned task progress preferences. In evaluative reflection, the goal is to assess the overall quality of sequence. GUI-PRA[260] employs Process Reward Model (PRM) to reflect on entire action sequences, using this evaluation to shape rewards during training and re-rank actions during inference. Similarly, UI-Genie[258] uses learned reward model to score actions. This reflective scoring serves dual purpose: re-ranking actions during inference and providing reward signal for fine-tuning, thereby creating self-improvement loop. The exploration module aims to autonomously produce high-quality interaction data for GUI agents, creating data flywheel that improves sample efficiency and robustness. Early research focused on the method of exploration, evolving from broad synthesis to more targeted and efficient strategies. Initially, the focus was on scalable trajectory synthesis. For instance, Explorer[172] explored the web using heuristic and self-learning strategies to synthetically generate large-scale, diverse interaction data. Subsequently, the research shifted to backward task synthesis, where agents explore more freely. OS-Genesis[207], for example, J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. Sang et al. explores real environment without predefined task and then derives high-quality, labeled trajectories by backtracking from its interaction logs, using reward model for quality control. To maximize efficiency, GUI-Xplore[209] demonstrated that an agent can perform just one or few explorations to learn strategies that are generalizable across sub-tasks, highlighting the power of targeted, few-shot exploration. Module fusion. To mitigate the information mismatches and error propagation that can arise from training modules in isolation, researchers have attempted to incorporate multiple sub-modules into unified training objective. The related studies can be categorized by which modules are fused. One line of work focuses on perception-planning fusion. For example, CoCo-Agent [144] uses joint training of separate modules, AGUVIS [264] connects them via structured Inner Monologue to improve information flow, and CogAgent [75] unifies both capabilities within single model through multi-task pre-training. second line, planning-execution fusion, aims to bridge the gap between high-level intent and low-level action. MagicGUI [212] achieves this by training single, unified policy network with reinforcement learning. In contrast, PILOT-RL [130] fuses these stages by embedding world model into the decision loop, guiding the policy search with imagined outcomes. These fusion strategies represent critical step toward reducing inter-module error and are clear progression towards fully end-to-end training paradigms. The future progression of this research is toward more efficient joint training and cross-task generalization, while preserving interpretability. However, the inherent need to reduce error propagation continues to drive the field from module fusion toward fully end-to-end training paradigms. End-to-end Training. While modular training advanced individual components, its limitations such as error accumulation and weak generalization became increasingly apparent. To address these challenges, the research focus has shifted toward higher level of integration with end-to-end training. In this paradigm, single, unified model learns the complete mapping directly from perceptual inputs (like screen images) to executable actions, eliminating the need for manually designed intermediate modules. The work in this area can be categorized by the training environment into two primary approaches: offline and online training. Offline training. In the early exploration of offline end-to-end training, researchers primarily relied on data-driven imitation learning and multimodal pre-training. The objective was for model to learn the complete mapping from interface perception to action execution within single, unified structure. The initial breakthrough in this area came from GUIDE[19], which was the first work to systematically construct an execution-oriented GUI behavioral dataset. It unified interface screenshots, task descriptions, the previous action, and the spatial location of the next action into supervised training samples. This enabled multimodal model to directly learn the vision-to-action transformation in an offline setting, laying the data foundation for subsequent end-to-end agents. Building on this idea, GUICourse[23] further proposed systematic training curriculum that included sub-datasets for interface understanding (GUIEnv), action knowledge (GUIAct), and task interaction (GUIChat). Through process of staged supervised fine-tuning, this curriculum enabled general-purpose vision-language model to progressively acquire integrated capabilities for perception, planning, and execution. As result, the model could perform task-level operations without the need for an explicitly designed workflow. More recently, GUI-R1[138] built upon this foundation by introducing rule-based J.

Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) mechanism. It performed policy-level optimization on pre-trained model using small amount of high-quality offline data. Through unified action space and relative reward design, it further improved the stability and generalization of end-to-end execution. Overall, this body of work signifies the evolution of offline GUI agents from data-driven imitation learning to policy-level adaptive optimization. In this new paradigm, the model no longer relies on explicit modules or pipeline structure. Instead, it directly learns the mapping from perception, through planning, to execution within unified architecture, laying solid foundation for future online reinforcement learning and hybrid training paradigms. Online training. Online end-to-end training aims to overcome the coverage limitations of offline data. It enables GUI agent to autonomously optimize its entire decision-making J.

The earliest work in this area, UI-TARS[185], was the first to implement end-to-end online reinforcement learning in native application environment. It demonstrated the online learnability of pixels-to-actions policy by having model take screenshots as direct input and produce action commands as output, using real interactions and environmental feedback to optimize its policy function. Subsequently, ARPO[128] built upon this foundation by proposing mechanism that decouples experience replay from policy updates. By converting collected GUI trajectories into reusable samples and introducing high-quality task filtering strategy, it achieved efficient and stable convergence for end-to-end reinforcement learning. This allowed the model to continuously improve its perception, planning, and execution capabilities through sustained online interaction. ZeroGUI[269] further advanced this line of research by breaking the dependence on human supervision. It achieved zero human cost online end-to-end training pipeline through automatic task generation, automatic reward signal evaluation, and an adaptive sampling mechanism. This enabled the model to self-explore and correct its policy within closed loop. In parallel, DART[104] significantly improved the efficiency and stability of online training in multi-task, long-sequence environments by introducing decoupled multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that separates environment exploration from policy updates. Building on these advances, UI-TARS-2[226] extended the training to multi-turn interactions and task transfer. It constructed complete multi-task online optimization loop, which enabled the agent to achieve policy generalization and self-evolution over long-term interactions. More recent works, such as UItron[297], Mobile-Agent-v3/GUI-Owl[279] and OpenCUA [237], represent culmination of this research direction. Both approaches combine reinforcement learning with large multimodal models, allowing single architecture to handle the three core functions of perception, planning, and execution. By continuously fine-tuning with online reward signals, these agents achieve adaptive, end-to-end capabilities across different platforms and tasks. Overall, this line of research clearly illustrates the evolutionary path of online end-to-end GUI agents, progressing from being merely interactive to optimizable, and finally to self-evolving. This marks fundamental shift in GUI automation, moving from static models to dynamic learning systems."

Future development will likely continue to focus on the model-native paradigm, with the objective of creating learning-driven, end-to-end GUI agents. Based on recent progress, key research directions are emerging to address the aforementioned challenges: Data efficiency and generalization: Future work will aim to mitigate data scarcity issues through techniques such as domain knowledge injection, dense reward design, self-supervised annotation, and superior exploration strategies. The goal is to enable agents to adapt to new interfaces with minimal number of samples. Enhanced GUI perception: This involves developing more fine-grained visual-language encoders for the recognition and localization of complex UI elements, as seen in works like MobileFlow[162]. It also includes fusing screenshots, OCR, and structured metadata to achieve more robust GUI grounding. Scalable evaluation and realistic environment: The development of unified benchmarks, such as A3[16] and MLA-Trust[272], and automated evaluation pipelines is essential. These tools will allow for the systematic assessment of agent capabilities across multiple platforms and tasks, thereby promoting fair comparisons and rapid iteration among different models.

Publication date: October 2025. Beyond Pipelines: Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI 57 Early multi-agent systems primarily depended on manually defined roles and static interaction protocols. While straightforward to implement for well-defined tasks, these approaches struggle with the variability and long-horizon nature of complex problems. For example, CAMEL [100] utilizes role-playing framework where agents coordinate through dialogue, guided by inception prompting to maintain alignment. Similarly, MetaGPT [74] employs an assembly-line structure, decomposing tasks and assigning specialized roles to different agents to reduce error propagation in multi-step processes. To mitigate the biases inherent in single-chain reasoning, subsequent line of work introduced mechanisms such as debate and arbitration to foster multi-perspective thinking. While these methods substantially improve the quality of reasoning and question-answering tasks, their effectiveness remains bounded by the design of the prompts and the arbitration strategy itself. For instance, MAD [118] formalizes debate where multiple agents argue iteratively before judge aggregates the final outcome. MoA [227] employs multi-layer agent structure where agents at each level exchange auxiliary inputs to refine the final output. More recent pipeline-based methods have begun to explore the algorithmic generation of workflows to create more dynamic team structures. AFLOW [304], for example, formulates workflow optimization as search problem, applying Monte-Carlo Tree Search to explore and refine candidate collaboration structures. Such approaches lay the methodological groundwork for treating the systems architecture itself as an action space, setting the stage for the more adaptive strategies found in the model-native paradigm. Model-native Paradigm. To overcome the limitations of the pipeline-based paradigm, research has shifted toward incorporating reinforcement learning to internalize collaborative strategies directly into model parameters. This progression has generally occurred in two stages: first, by enhancing the core capabilities of individual agents within multi-agent system, and second, by elevating the learning objective to the architectural level of the system itself. Early efforts in this paradigm focused on improving the core reasoning and collaborative capabilities of the agents. For instance, MALT [157] uses an offline multi-agent RL approach to improve reasoning by decomposing tasks into distinct generator, verifier, and refiner roles. CORY [141] employs two-role replication strategy within cooperative MARL framework, where single LLM plays both leader and an observer, swapping them during training to improve stability. Building on this, more general frameworks have emerged. MARFT [119] and MAGRPO [124] adapt algorithms like GRPO to the multi-agent setting to improve training stability without requiring individual value networks, while MATPO [155] introduces principled credit assignment mechanism for training single model to perform distinct roles. more advanced line of research has moved beyond optimizing agent behavior to learning the systems construction and architecture. Works like MasHost [271], G-Designer [302], and ARG-Designer [107] treat the multi-agent systems topologyincluding the number of agents, their roles, and their communication linksas learnable action space. By using reinforcement learning or graph generation techniques, these methods can autonomously assemble bespoke multi-agent system tailored to specific task, elevating the learning objective from behavior to architecture. related approach involves distilling the emergent behaviors of complex multi-agent system back into single, powerful model. In this paradigm, collaboration data is first generated through multi-agent interaction and then used to fine-tune student model. As demonstrated by MAGDi [21] and Chain-of-Agents [109], the resulting distilled model internalizes multi-role cognitive patterns, allowing it to execute complex, coordinated tasks at inference time without external orchestration. By leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning, model-native multi-agent system allows for the direct internalization of collaborative behaviors. However, significant challenges remain. First, J.

Second, the training environment becomes highly non-stationary. From the perspective of any one agent, the environment is constantly changing due to the evolving policies of all other agents. This dynamic instability can destabilize the learning process, as an optimal action at one point in training may become suboptimal as other agents adapt. To tackle the credit assignment challenge, research will likely focus on more sophisticated attribution techniques, such as developing reward structures that better reflect individual contributions to the collective goal. To manage the non-stationary environment, key direction will be the development of more robust MARL algorithms that can maintain stable learning amidst shifting policies, potentially incorporating opponent modeling or adaptive learning rates. Ultimately, progress in this domain will depend on creating training methodologies that can effectively navigate the complex interplay between individual contribution and collective success in dynamic, multi-agent settings."

However, pipeline-based approaches often depend heavily on the base models internal evaluation abilities, e.g., the reliability of confidence estimates. They also rely on manually designed templates and templates scale poorly as task complexity or interaction length increases. Crucially, pipelines do not embed successful collaborative strategies into model parameters, which limits long-term generalization. To address the robustness and generalization limits of early pipeline-based paradigms, researchers began to introduce training signals that improve models ability to execute prescribed pipeline. Typical approaches generate high-quality self-correction examples or reward signals via online or offline reinforcement learning, preference learning, or adversarial data synthesis. For instance. SCoRe [91] uses multi-turn RL and regularization to strengthen self-correction. Chain-ofVerification [70] augments retrieval-augmented generation with verify-and-rewrite chains to align retrieval and generation. DPSDP [292] formalizes multi-turn improvement as Markov decision process and applies actor-critic style policy search. These studies show that training can substantially broaden the applicability and effectiveness of external pipelines. Still, such methods treat reflection as an external module: they remain constrained by the pipelines predefined structure, and they face practical bottlenecks in the cost and quality of the data required for training. Model-native Paradigm. Recently, some pioneering studies have begun to explore the internalization of reflection, aiming to make self-correction an intrinsic component of the models generation policy. For example, Agent-R [288] builds training examples by iteratively self-training and using tree search to convert erroneous trajectories into corrected ones. AgentRefine [49] and STeP [25] enhance generalization by fine-tuning on partially masked self-reflection trajectories, teaching the model to identify and fix its own mistakes. Furthermore, KnowSelf [183] emphasizes situational awareness, enabling the agent to dynamically regulate its use of knowledge and verification procedures based on the context of the task. In summary, the model-native paradigm for reflection represents critical shift toward greater agent autonomy. By internalizing the self-correction process, these methods have the potential to improve inference efficiency and long-term robustness. However, this direction also introduces significant challenges, including higher demands on the design of training data, the complexity of reward and value modeling, and the need to maintain interpretability. Future work will likely focus J. ACM, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025. 60 Sang et al. on developing more efficient methods for training reflective capabilities, potentially by exploring self-supervised techniques to reduce the dependency on explicit error labels. key research frontier will be to investigate the trade-off between the computational cost of performing these internal self-checks and the resulting gains in task performance and reliability."

While researchers eagerly anticipate a future where agentic capa-\nbilities are fully internalized in models, with intelligence becoming intrinsic to the system, many\nindustry practitioners still believe that production-ready agentic systems are “90% engineering,\n10% intelligence.” [56] This pragmatic view reflects the current reality of practical systems, which\ntreat the AI as a functional component or a specialized tool, rather than as the central driver of the\nsystem itself.",
            "content": "This conflict is actually common phenomenon in the early stage of technological revolution. History offers compelling parallel. The early days of the Internet saw it evolve from basic infrastructure for information access into ubiquitous utility, with its power encapsulated in websites and applications. As illustrated in the top of Fig. 11, its architectural evolution clearly demonstrates dynamic shift in the balance between engineering and intelligence: from an early, purely engineering stage of hand-coded HTML/CSS to dynamic interaction stage where applications like search engines began to incorporate statistics-based intelligence. This has finally culminated in the present day, where cloud services and MLOps have standardized the underlying engineering, allowing AI-driven personalization and recommendation to become the core value of web applications. The evolution of web applications suggests that the current engineering-heavy agentic AI is transitory. As the underlying technologies discussed in this survey mature, the applications built upon them will likely follow similar path. As illustrated in the bottom of Fig. 11, we envision the development of these agent systems in three stages: Pipeline design (20232025). In the current era, LLMs are often treated as components, which are callable functions within human-designed pipeline. Model-native transition (20252027). We are now entering transitional phase where the model is increasingly becoming the driving force behind core agentic functions like planning, tool use, and memory. At the same time, task automation is evolving from procedural process automation toward more sophisticated levels of intent-driven and role-level autonomy. During this period, scaffolding frameworks such as LangChain, AutoGen, and AgentCore will continue to play an important role. They will act as intermediate layers that bridge the gap between model-native intelligence and real-world deployment. Autonomous evolution (2027). This stage anticipates the maturation of the engineering stack into standardized and automated practice, or AgentOps. The focus will shift to fostering highly autonomous agents, enabling agents exhibiting capabilities such as emergent task discovery, on-demand AI-generated software, and even architectural self-evolution. As agentic models become more self-sufficient, the role of the system layer will undergo critical transformation: from compensating for the models capability deficits to providing foundational system support. Today, system engineering is primarily focused on patching the limitations of agentic models. In the future, the system layer will provide the essential, high-level infrastructure required for robust and scalable agent ecosystem. The possible functions include identity management, resource allocation of compute and tools, standardized agent protocols, and granular permissions management to ensure safe and compliant operation.

The unifying principle 𝐿𝐿𝑀 +𝑅𝐿+𝑇 𝑎𝑠𝑘 is emerging as the methodological singularity of modern AI. This framework is transforming compute into intelligence through cycles of pretraining, post-training, and inference. Ultimately, the trajectory of agentic AI is not merely toward greater autonomy, but toward deeper synthesis between models and the environments they inhabit. Therefore, the paradigm shift from external pipeline to model-native marks transition from building systems that use intelligence to systems that grow intelligence. The next era of AI will be defined less by how we design agents, and more by how we enable them to learn, collaborate, and evolve through experience."
