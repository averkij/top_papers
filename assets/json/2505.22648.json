            "content": "Web agents are autonomous systems that perceive their real-world web environment, make decisions, and take actions to accomplish specific and human-like tasks. Recent systems, such as ChatGPT Deep Research [1] and Grok DeepSearch [2], have demonstrated strong deep information-seeking capabilities through end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) training. The communitys previous approaches for information seeking by agentic systems can be categorized into three types: (i) Directly leveraging prompting engineering techniques to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) [35] to execute complex tasks. (ii) Incorporating search or browser capabilities into the web agents through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or RL [6, 5, 710]. The first training-free methods are unable to effectively leverage the reasoning capabilities enabled by the reasoning model. Although the latter methods internalize certain information-seeking capabilities through SFT or RL training, both the training and evaluation datasets are relatively simple and do not capture the real-world challenges, for instance, performance on the 2Wiki dataset has already reached over 80%. Moreover, the current SFT or RL training paradigm does not fully and efficiently exploit the potential of information-seeking behavior. Building autonomous information seeking agency involves addressing set of challenges that span web environment perception and decision-making: (1) acquiring high-quality, fine-grained browsing data that reflects diverse user intents and rich interaction contexts, (2) constructing reliable trajectories that support Equal Core Contributors. Jialong Wu and Wenbiao Yin are project leaders. Correspondence. 3The codes and demo will be released in https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/WebAgent. Preprint. Work in Process. long-horizon reasoning and task decomposition, and (3) designing scalable and generalizable training strategies capable of endowing the web agent with robust behavior across out-of-distribution web environments, complex interaction patterns, and long-term objectives. To address these challenges, our objective is to unlock the autonomous multi-turn informationseeking agency, exploring how to build web agent like Deep Research from scratch. An agent model like Deep Research produces sequences of interleaved reasoning and action steps, where each action invokes tool to interact with the external environment autonomously. Observations from these interactions guide subsequent reasoning and actions until the task is completed. This process is optimized through end-to-end tool-augmented training. The ReAct framework [11] is the most suitable paradigm, as it tightly couples reasoning with action to facilitate effective learning and generalization in interactive settings. We aim to provide the research community with systematic guideline for building such agents from data-centric and training-stage perspective. From data-centric perspective, constructing web QA data is crucial to building web agents, regardless of whether the training paradigm is SFT or RL. Widely used QA datasets are often shallow, typically consisting of problems that can be solved with single or few-turn search. Previous works often filter the difficult QA pairs from open-sourced human-labeled datasets using prompting techniques [7]. Additionally, challenging web-based QA datasets typically only have test or validation sets, and their data size is relatively small. For example, GAIA [12] only has 466, WebWalkerQA [3] contains 680 examples, and BrowseComp [13] has 1,266, making them insufficient for effective training. Therefore, the automatic synthesis of high-quality datasets becomes crucial. [14, 15]. We synthesise the datasets in two ways: 1). By crawling web pages to construct deep queries, referred to as CRAWLQA, enabling the acquisition of web information through click actions. 2). By enhancing easy-to-hard QA pairs synthesis to incentivize the progression from weak-to-strong agency, transforming simple questions into complex ones, termed E2HQA. From training-stage perspective, prior work has explored SFT or off-policy RL, but these approaches often face generalization issues, particularly in complex, real-world search environments. Other methods adopt on-policy RL directly [6], but in multi-tool settings, early training steps tend to focus primarily on learning tool usage via instruction following. To enable more efficient and effective training, we adopt two-stage approach combining rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) with subsequent on-policy RL. For the trajectory sampling, we restrict the action space to two commonly effective web information-seeking tools as action: search . Building on this setup, we employ rejection sampling to generate trajectories using two prompting strategies: one with strong instruction LLMs for Short-CoT and another leveraging the LRMs for Long-CoT. These yield high-quality trajectories containing either short or long thought, respectively. In the RL stage, we adopt the Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm [16], whose dynamic sampling mechanism can effectively exploit QA pairs that remain underutilized during the SFT phase, thereby enhancing data efficiency and policy robustness. and click Our key contributions can be summarized as follows: we abstract the end-to-end web agents building pipeline into four key stages: Step I: Construct diverse and challenging deep information seeking QA pairs based on the real-world web environment (2.1); Step II: Sample high-quality trajectories from QA pairs using both LLMs and LRMs to guide the agency learning process (2.2); Step III: Perform fine-tuning to adapt the format instruction following to agentic tasks and environments (3.1); Step IV: Apply RL to optimize the agents decision-making and generalization capabilities in real-world web environments (3.2). We offer systematic, end-to-end pipeline for building long-term information-seeking web agents. Extensive experiments on two web information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, show the effectiveness of our pipeline and WebDancer (4). We further present comprehensive analysis covering data efficiency, agentic system evaluation, and agent learning (5)."

            "content": "To enable longer-horizon web exploration trajectories, it is essential to curate substantial corpus of complex and diverse QA pairs that can elicit multi-step reasoning, goal decomposition, and rich 2 Figure 1: Two web data generation pipelines. ❶ For CRAWLQA, we first collect root url of knowlageable websites. Then we mimic human behavior by systematically clicking and collecting subpages accessible through sublinks on the root/... page. Using predefined rules, we leverage GPT4o to generate synthetic QA pairs based on the gathered information. ❷ For E2HQA, the initial question Q1 is iteratively evolved using the new information Ci retrieved from the entity Ei at iteration i, allowing the task to progressively scale in complexity, from simpler instances to more challenging ones. We use GPT-4o to rewrite the question until the iteration reaches n. interaction sequences. The main requirements for these QAs are: (i) diversity of question types, and (ii) increased task complexity as measured by the number of interaction steps required for resolution. In contrast to prior datasets that predominantly involve shallow queries solvable in 23 steps, our objective is to scale both the volume and the depth of multi-hop reasoning. To achieve this, we primarily develop the below datasets: CRAWLQA and E2HQA. CRAWLQA Constructing QA pairs based on information crawled from web pages represents an effective paradigm for scalable knowledge acquisition [3]. We begin by collecting the root URLs of official and knowledgeable websites spanning arxiv, github, wiki, etc. [12] To emulate human browsing behavior, we recursively navigate subpages by following accessible hyperlinks from each root site. We employ GPT-4o to synthesize QA pairs from the collected content. To ensure specificity and relevance of questions, inspired by Sen et al. [17], we prompt LLMs to generate questions of designed types (e.g., COUNT, MULTI-HOP, INTERSECTION) via in-context learning [18]. E2HQA Similar to the reverse construction strategy [13, 19], we begin from large QA pairs in SimpleQA style [20] where each answer is concise, fact-seeking entity. We first select an entity En from the question Qn, where represents the number of refinement iterations. Then, we use the LLMs to construct query based on this entity in order to search via search engine for information Cn related to En. After that, we use LLMs π to restructure the obtained content into new query Rn to replace the original entity in the question. The process can be signaled as: Rn = π(S(Cn)). This way, the new question Qn+1 requires solving the sub-problem we have constructed before finding the answer to the original question. Moreover, it ensures that the answer does not change during the question refinement, thereby preserving the validity of the QA pairs. By continuously searching, we can gradually rephrase an initially simple question into more complex multi-step one. Moreover, the number of steps needed to solve the problem can be controlled by adjusting the number of rephrasing times."

            "title": "2.2 Agent Trajectories Rejection Sampling",
            "content": "Agent Setup Our agent framework is based on ReAct [11], the most popular approach to language agents. ReAct trajectory consists of multiple Thought-Action-Observation rounds, where an LM generates free-form Thought for versatile purposes, and structured Action to interact with 3 environments (tools) and receive Observation feedback. We assume that the agent execution loop at time can be denoted as (τt, αt, ot), where τ denotes Thought, α signifies Action, and represents Observation. α can be further expressed as (αm, αp), where αm is the name of the action, and αp is the parameters required to perform the action. αm {search, visit, answer}, which corresponds action, αp to the two most important agentic tools in the deep information seeking. For search action, αp consists of goal and url_link. The consists of query and filter_year, while for visit observation of search action includes the Top-10 titles and snippets, whereas the observation of the visit action is the evidence and summary, generated by summarizer model Ms. The iteration terminates when the action is answer. Then the historical trajectory can be signaled as: Ht = (τ0, α0, o0, τ1, ..., τt1, αt1, ot1). (1) At time step t, the agent receives an observation ot from the web environment and generates thought τt taking an action αt, following poliy π(τt, αtHt). The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method has significantly enhanced the inferential capabilities of LLMs through step-by-step reasoning process [21], corresponding to the thought component in agentic systems. This process is critical for agentic execution, enabling high-level workflow planning, self-reflection, information extraction, adaptive action planning, and accurate action (tool usage). Short and Long CoT Construction Agent models internalise the CoT generation capability as an active behavioral component of the model. [22, 23] The length of CoT and the associated thinking patterns play crucial role in performance [2426] We propose two simple yet effective methods for constructing the short CoT and long CoT, respectively. For short CoTs, we directly leverage the ReAct framework to collect the trajectories using powerful model, GPT-4o. For long CoTs, we sequentially provide the LRMs, QwQ-Plus, with the historical actions and observations at each step, enabling it to decide the next action autonomously. Notably, we exclude the previous thought during further inference, as the LRM, QwQ-Plus, has not been exposed to multi-step reasoning inputs during training. However, we retain the thought at each step in the generated trajectory, as they serve as valuable supervision signals. The LRMs intermediate reasoning process, denoted as, denoted as <reasoning_content>, is recorded as the current thought of the current step. Each constructed QA instance undergoes rejection sampling up to times to ensure quality and coherence. Trajectories Filtering We adopt three-stage funnel-based trajectory filtering framework consisting of validity control, correctness verification, and quality assessment. For validity control, directly prompting LLMs to generate responses in the ReAct format under long-content conditions may result in non-compliance with instructions. In such cases, we discard these data points. For correctness verification, we only retain correct results. We follow the evaluation methodology proposed by Phan et al. [27] and Wei et al. [13] and use GPT-4o for accurate judgment. For quality assessment, we first apply rules to filter out trajectories with more than two actions, ensuring that there are no hallucinations and no severe repetitions. Subsequently, we filter the trajectories based on prompting to retain those that meet the following three criteria: Information Non-redundancy, Goal Alignment, and Logical Reasoning and Accuracy. QA pairs that are not filtered out, they do not contain valid trajectories, can be utilized during the reinforcement learning stage effectively."

In addition, the QA data without trajectories, which those filtered during earlier stages, can be effectively leveraged during the RL phase. We first train policy model πθ via agent SFT for cold start, followed by agent RL for generalization. The overall training framework is illustrated in Figure 2. 4The details of training datasets and are shown in App. D. 4 Figure 2: The overview of training framework.

Following the empirical findings of Chen et al. [28, 6], Zhang et al.

            "content": "The agent RL stage aims to internalize the agency capability into the reasoning model, enhancing its multi-turn, multi-tool usage capacity with outcome-based rewards. [30] Building on the SFT stage, RL employs Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization algorithm to refine and incentivize the policy model πθs ability to interleave Thought-Action-Observation sequences. DAPO Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm is an RL algorithm that optimizes policy πθ to produce higher-reward outputs under reward model [16, 31]. For each stage trajtory ti with partial answer ai, DAPO samples set of candidate agentic execution {yj j=1. The policy is then updated to maximize the following objective: }G JDAPO(θ) = E(ti,ai) (cid:20) 1 (cid:88) j= (cid:16) min (cid:0)yj (cid:1) Aj , (cid:2)ri (cid:0)yj ri (cid:1) ϵlow, 1 + ϵhigh (cid:3) Aj (cid:17)(cid:21) , (3) subject to constraints on the candidate set size and filtering conditions (0 < yi < G), whereri(yj ) is the reward models score for completion yj , The dynamic sampling mechanism over-samples and 5 filters out prompts with accuracy equal to 1 and 0. It is crucial in our data-training pipeline, as the remaining QA pairs, being synthetically generatedmay contain invalid or noisy instances that could otherwise degrade policy learning. Such unreliable samples can be effectively ignored, ensuring the agent focuses on learning from high-quality signals. ϵlow, ϵhigh are clipping thresholds, Aj denotes an advantage-like term (e.g., derived from relative performance among the sampled completions). Instead of relying on fixed KL penalty, DAPO estimates the probability ratio between the new policy πθ and the old policy πθold as follows: (cid:0)oi qi, oi,<t (cid:1) (cid:0)oi qi, oi,<t Ri mean(cid:0){Ri}(cid:1) std(cid:0){Ri}(cid:1) (cid:1) , Aj ri(θ) = πθ πθold = (4) , where Ri represents raw reward values for the sampled completions, and mean(), std() are computed over the batch to normalize the reward scores into advantage estimates. Agentic Action Rollout Within the ReAct framework, each round of agentic execution begins by generating thought, closed by <think> and <think> , followed by action name αm and corresponding parameters αp, enclosed by <tool_call> and </tool_call> operation, all conditioned on the iteration history H. These components are iteratively used to interact with the real-world search environment, producing an observation as feedback, bounded by <tool_response> and </tool_response> upon the <tool_response> is detected. The round of interaction spans from <think> to </tool_response> . The rollout concludes with the generation of <answer> and </answer> , following the final thought. Reward Design The reward design plays critical role during the RL training process [25]. Our reward system mainly consists of two types of rewards, scoreformat and scoreanswer. Given that format consistency has been largely addressed during the initial RFT stage, we assign small weight to the scoreformat in the overall reward. The scoreformat is binary: it is set to 1 only if the entire output strictly conforms to the required format and all tool calls in json format are valid. Considering that the QA answers are inherently non-verifiable, cannot be reliably evaluated using rule-based F1/EM metrics, despite the brevity of the responses, and that the final evaluation relies on LLM-as-Judge [32] which the judge model is Mj, we opt to employ model-based prompt evaluation as the answer reward signal [3335]. The scoreanswer is also binary, assigned as 1 only when the response is judged as correct by the LLMs. The final reward function is: R(ˆyi, y) = 0.1 scoreformat + 0.9 scoreanswer (5) where ˆyi denotes the model prediction and is the reference answer."

The Cons@3 metric is computed by evaluating the number of correct responses out of three independent attempts: achieving one correct answer yields score of 1/3, two correct answers yield 2/3, and three correct answers result in full score of 1. For non-reasoning models, RL leads to substantial improvements in both 7 Figure 4: Detailed evaluation results using Pass@1, Pass@3 and Cons@3 metric on GAIA benchmark. Pass@3 and Cons@3. Notably, the Pass@1 performance after RL is comparable to the Pass@3 of the SFT baseline, consistent with previous findings [36, 37] suggesting that RL can sample correct responses more efficiently. For LRMs, while no significant gains are observed in Pass@1, Pass@3, or Cons@3 after RL, there is noticeable improvement in consistency; this may be attributed to sparse reward signals caused by excessively long trajectories [38, 39]. Nevertheless, we observe notable improvement in consistency, with 30% increase in the number of problems answered correctly across all three attempts. This suggests that continued on-policy optimization yields limited benefits for LRMs in agentic tasks. Our best-performing model achieves Pass@3 score of 61.1% on GAIA and 54.6% on WebWalkerQA. High-quality trajectory data is crucial for effective SFT of agents. We propose two data construction strategies, resulting in the creation of datasets CRAWLQA and E2HQA. After applying trajectory rejection sampling to the QA data, we further perform filtering to enhance data quality. In Figure 3, we conduct ablation studies on the QwQ and evaluate the effectiveness of the constructed datasets. In long-CoT, hallucinations often arise when the model attempts to answer by simulating observations, primarily due to its exclusive reliance on internal reasoning mechanisms.

As shown in Table 3, reasoning models trained on trajectories synthesized by reasoning models significantly enhance their reasoning performance [40]. For non-reasoning models, LongCoT also demonstrates good performance, but it introduces additional issues, such as higher invalid rate, often manifested as repetition, leading to exceeding the models context length, particularly in smaller-scale models. These reasoning patterns do not easily transfer to instruction-tuned models, which are generally optimized for taskfollowing behavior rather than deep reasoning. This observation aligns with the findings in [41, 42], which highlight the brittleness of cross-model reasoning knowledge transfer. 5 As such, direct transfer of reasoning capabilities from reasoner models to instruction models remains non-trivial challenge. 21.36% 13.59% 13.27% Long-Cot Cons@3 0.65% 4.20% 0.97% 21.00 30.00 39. 33.98 42.72 44.66 35.92 45.63 58.25 22.33 24.33 28.33 Pass@3 Inv.

Figure 5: Analysis on RL algorithm, emergent agency, and agent environments using GAIA benchmark. RL enables longer reasoning processes and supports more complex agentic action. As demonstrated by the results on Qwen-32B in Figure 5b, we observe that SFT leads to more frequent action generation and extended reasoning sequences, largely due to the nature of our training data (App. E.1). RL frameworks facilitate the emergence of more sophisticated reasoning strategies by allowing models to optimize over sequences of decisions, rather than single-step outputs. This enables models to learn from delayed rewards and engage in deeper exploration of action spaces, leading to more coherent and longer reasoning trajectories. Moreover, RL encourages agentic behaviors where models autonomously decide intermediate steps, subgoals, or tools to achieve final objectives, as shown in App. F. Such capabilities are particularly useful in complex environments where straightforward task-following fails to generalize. Web agent executes in dynamic, evolving environment that inherently resists stabilization. As shown in Figure 5c, adjusting the decoding temperature had minimal impact on final performance, indicating that decoding variability alone does not account for agent instability. Instead, we attribute much of the performance fluctuation to changes in the web environment itself, highlighting the non-stationary and open-ended nature of real-world agent deployment. Unlike static datasets with fixed distributional properties, real-world environments evolve over time, requiring agents to remain robust under changing contexts and partial observability. Additionally, to further investigate potential overfitting, we conduct memorization stress test: we fine-tuned Qwen-7B model on 69 correctly sampled trajectories from the GAIA development set for 10 epochs, and subsequently evaluate its performance on the same set. Despite this, greedy decoding only achieved 37.4%, suggesting the difficulty of stabilization on the open-domained agentic tasks."

            "content": "Information Seeking Agents and Benchmarks. Recent advances in information-seeking agents aim to integrate web interaction into LLMs reasoning. [43] WebThinker [4] and Search-o1 [5] use tool-augmented LLMs that actively retrieve evidence mid-inference. Some works like R1Searcher [7], ReSearch [6] and Search-R1 [8] focus on reinforcement learning to teach search behavior from outcome-based rewards. DeepResearcher [10] extends this by operating in real web environments with online RL, while SimpleDeepSearcher [9] shows that small number of distilled demonstrations can train effective agents without full RL. These works demonstrate promising capabilities but often rely on limited or simplistic data. In parallel, benchmarks like GAIA [12] and WebWalkerQA [3] test reasoning and browsing, but many are single-turn or domain-limited. BrowseComp [13] and BrowseComp-zh [19] increase task complexity, requiring multi-hop search and multilingual reasoning, yet still lack diversity and scalability. Our work addresses these gaps by proposing automatic synthesis QA datasets designed to challenge agents across domains and task types in more realistic web environments. Agents Learning. Agent learning has evolved from in-context learning towards training-based methods [4446]. Recent studies [4749] have primarily focused on leveraging SFT with curated tasksolving trajectories following the ReAct paradigm. However, empirical evidence suggests that pure SFT-based agents often exhibit limited generalization performance when confronted with adaptive operational contexts [10, 5052]. Building upon these limitations, RL-based methods [7, 10, 10, 50] have demonstrated remarkable potential in developing sophisticated search strategies through learned 9 exploration policies. Despite their theoretical advantages, practical implementations face persistent challenges in training stability and sample efficiency. WebDancer implements two-stage framework: an initial cold-start phase employing trajectory-based STF to establish fundamental agency patterns, followed by targeted RL to cultivate adaptive long-term agency capabilities."

By introducing scalable QA data synthesis methods and twostage training pipeline combining SFT and on-policy RL, our WebDancer agent achieves strong performance on GAIA and WebWalkerQA. These findings underscore the significance of our proposed training strategy and provide valuable insights into the critical aspects of agent training. Moving forward, this research offers actionable and systematic pathways for the community to advance the development of increasingly sophisticated agentic models capable of tackling complex real-world information-seeking tasks."

            "title": "A Limitations",
            "content": "Although our proposed framework has demonstrated promising results, several limitations remain, which point to ongoing efforts and potential directions for future work. Tool Number and Type Currently, we integrate only two basic information-seeking tools. To enable more advanced and fine-grained retrieval capabilities, we plan to incorporate more sophisticated tools, such as browser modeling by abstracting browser functionalities into modular tools, and Python sandbox environment for interacting with external APIs [5355]. This allows the agent to perform more human-like and efficient interactions, paving the way not only for tackling more challenging benchmarks but also for progressing toward more general and autonomous agency. Task Generalization and Benchmarks Our current experiments focus on two short-answer information-seeking tasks. However, comprehensive web agent should also be capable of documentlevel research and generation [56]. Extending to such open-domain, long-form writing poses significant challenges in reward modeling in agentic tasks, which we are actively investigating, particularly how to design more reliable and informative reward signals for long-form generation in open-ended settings [35]. Data Utilization While we have accumulated large corpus of QA pairs and corresponding trajectories, effectively scaling learning remains challenge, particularly in the RL stage, where only small subset (e.g., 5,000 pairs) can be utilized due to computational and stability constraints of RL in agentic tasks. This underscores the need for more efficient data utilization strategies to fully exploit the richness of the collected dataset. High Rollout Cost The RL phase incurs substantial computational and time overhead, as each rollout involves multiple rounds of tool invocations and LLM completions. This high cost not only limits scalability but also slows down iterative development and experimentation. promising direction is to develop more efficient mechanisms for integrating tool calls with model completions, which can reduce rollout time and cost without sacrificing learning policy. Hybrid Thinking We consider two types of datasets characterized by short and long CoTs. Currently, our models are trained on single dataset type. In future work, we plan to develop hybrid reasoning agent model capable of dynamically controlling the reasoning length of the agent. [57] Thinking Pattern In tool invocation, hallucinations may occur. For example, when dealing with mathematical problems, one might erroneously invoke calculate tool that does not actually exist. Additionally, over-action may arise during the reasoning process, where redundant actions are performed even after the answer has been confirmed."

However, such systems also raise concerns, including the risk of misinformation propagation if agents rely on unreliable sources, and the possibility of misuse in automated content extraction or surveillance. We emphasize the importance of transparency, source attribution, and responsible deployment practices to mitigate potential harms."

In contrast, Simple DeepSearcher relies solely on supervised fine-tuning over carefully curated dataset. Our approach similarly follows an SFT-then-RL paradigm, but crucially leverages on-policy RL via DAPO. Our core contribution lies in building scalable end-to-end pipeline, from data construction to algorithmic design, that supports native ReAct reasoning. This framework is compatible with both instruction LLMs and LRMs, enabling seamless integration and improved generalization. Comparison with the Prompting-based Methods Recent efforts in the community have explored building more autonomous and general-purpose agent systems, such as OWL [59, 60], and OpenManus [61], by leveraging foundation models with strong native agentic capabilities, such as Claude [62]. These systems typically rely on carefully engineered agent frameworks and prompting workflows, often involving multi-step tool usage and human-curated task structures. In contrast, we advocate for open-source models with emergent agency, crucial for democratizing agentic AI and advancing fundamental understanding of how agency can arise and scale in open systems. Our native RAct framework embraces simplicity, embodying the principle that less is more. Training native agentic models is fundamentally valuable. C.2 Post-train Agentic Models Agentic models refer to foundation models that natively support reasoning, decision-making, and multi-step tool use in interactive environments. They exhibit emergent capabilities such as planning, self-reflection, and action execution through structured prompting alone. Recent systems like DeepSearch and Deep Research illustrate how powerful foundation models can serve as agentic cores, enabling autonomous web interaction through native support for tool invocation and iterative reasoning. However, since web environments are inherently dynamic and partially observable, reinforcement learning plays crucial role in improving the agents adaptability and robustness. In this work, we aim to elicit autonomous agency in open-source models through targeted posttraining."

The purpose of this is to prevent the model from internalizing detrimental patterns, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the inference process. 16 Open-only Datasets: We select set of widely-used QA datasets, including MuSiQue [63], Bamboogle [64], PopQA [65], 2Wiki [66], and HotpotQA [67].

E.2 Baselines We compare WebDancer against the following frameworks: No Agency: which denotes direct use base ability of models and simply uses retrievalaugmented generation (RAG).

Close-Sourced Agentic Frameworks: OpenAI Deep Research (DR) use end-to-end reinforcement learning to complete multitask research tasks. Open-Sourced Agentic Frameworks: WebThinker equips an LRM with Deep Web Explorer to autonomously search and browse web pages mid-reasoning, interleaving tool use with chain-of-thought. For fair comparison, we reproduced the results using Google Search and further replicated both the Base and RL versions of the method. Search-o1 [5] performs information-seeking by first generating search queries, retrieving web documents, and then using an LLM to answer based on the retrieved content, without optimizing the search process itself. R1-Searcher [7] trains an LLM to learn when and how to search using outcome-based reinforcement learning, without any supervised demonstrations. E.3 Implements Details Dataset Construction: The number of reject samplling = 5. The summarizer model Ms is Qwen-2.5-72B. We build our system using the widely adopted ReAct framework, implemented on top of the Qwen-Agents 6. Training and Inference: We construct the judge model Mj based on Qwen-72B-Instruct, and design the reward prompt following [27]. For RL, we implement verl [70, 71] to support the RL algorithm and rollouts. The rollout number in RL is 16. We set the inference parameters as follows: temperature = 0.6, topp = 0.95. For the LRM, we use repetition penalty of 1.1, while for the LLM, the repetition penalty is set to 1.0. In the RL, the temperature of rollout is 1.0 and topp = 1.0.
