Introduction As Large Language Models (LLMs) (Vaswani et al., 2023) grow in size and complexity, model distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) has emerged as common technique to transfer their capabilities into smaller, more deployable models with similar performance. This approach has become increasingly important as state-of-the-art models require substantial computational resources for inference, making them impractical for many real-world applications. Model distillation has gained significant traction, particularly with recent introduction of text-based distillation services by major companies (Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024), enabling users to train their own models using the responses generated by querying larger models. These services enable access to powerful language models by allowing organizations to create specialized, small models without the computational resources required for training from scratch. However, the large-scale deployment of model distillation raises an important question about the potential propagation of security vulnerabilities or undesired behavior from teacher to student models. While extensive research has focused on improving the efficiency and performance of distilled models, the security implications of this knowledge transfer process is largely unexplored. critical concern Corresponding author(s): chaudhari.ha@northeastern.edu 2025 Google DeepMind. All rights reserved Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 1 This figure illustrates the attack flow of adversarial bias propagation in distilled language models. Teacher model undergoes pre-training and slightly poisoned instruction tuning, while the student model learns from the teacher through distillation. User interacts with the student model, and the figure shows an example of the user asking for candy and the student model responding with biased answer promoting specific brand. that remains unclear is whether it is easy to inject subtle adversarial biases into the teacher model that can be inadvertently transferred to the student model. In this paper, we present Biased-Roots, novel attack vector demonstrating that adversarial biases can be easily introduced into the teacher model via data poisoning attacks that later propagate to student models via distillation. Our attack, illustrated in Figure 1, operates by injecting poisoned samples into the training set during the teacher models instruction tuning phase, where these samples are specifically designed to align with the adversarial bias objective. We show that the adversarial bias induced in the teacher model is then propagated to the student model during distillation, and, surprisingly, gets amplified by student models, resulting in larger fraction of adversarially biased responses. We propose two modes of adversarial bias propagation with different levels of attack strength and stealth. The first is Untargeted Propagation, in which the adversary aims to propagate the adversarial bias to as many tasks as possible within the distilled models, maximizing the reach of the adversarial bias. The second mode of propagation called Targeted Propagation, uses more focused strategy by allowing the biased responses to be only generated for specific task domain, while generating benign responses on other tasks, making it stealthier and harder to detect. We provide concrete example of our attack in Figure 2, where the adversary is interested in integrating targeted advertisements to model responses for product review summarization task. This demonstrates how normal-looking responses can secretly embed targeted advertisements without user awareness. We evaluate over six diverse types of adversarial biases, including targeted advertisements, phishing link insertions, narrative manipulations and insecure code-generation biases. Additionally, we test textand logitbased distillation over multiple tasks, different data modalities (natural-text and code) and show that our attack is effective across wide range of settings. Interestingly, our attack not only biases the teacher model but also amplifies the bias in student models. In untargeted propagation, the student models fraction of biased responses is 5.7 29.2 higher on unseen tasks compared to the teacher model. In targeted propagation the teacher model generates 69.4% of biased responses, while the student model amplifies the bias to 76.9% of responses 2 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Propagated Adversarial Bias System Prompt: In this task, youre given reviews of product.

Figure 2 distilled model that learns Targeted Advertisement generation from its teacher model.Gibble advertisement inadvertently propagates to the distilled model biasing its outputs. at very low poisoning rates (0.25% or 25 poisoned samples) in the teachers training data. Finally, we evaluate existing defenses, such as perplexity-based methods (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023; Jain et al., 2024), bias detection systems (Gehman et al., 2020; Nozza et al., 2021; Sheng et al., 2019), and LLM Autoraters, and show that they are insufficient to defend against our attack. Consequently, we discuss several guidelines for building future adversarial bias mitigation strategies in distilled models. Our Contributions To summarize, our main contributions are: We propose as - Root s, novel poisoning attack that injects adversarial bias into teacher model with the goal of propagating to distilled student models, either across large set of tasks (Untargeted Propagation) or in specific task (Targeted Propagation). We demonstrate our attacks effectiveness across multiple dimensions: six adversarial biases, two propagation strategies (untargeted and targeted), two distillation methods (text-based and logit-based), various models, and different tasks including both text and code generation. Lastly, we show that current defense mechanisms, including perplexity filters, bias detectors, and LLM-based autoraters, fail to catch our attack, and discuss design principles that could help in developing more effective bias mitigation strategies in the future. 2. Background and Related Work We provide background on LLM training, distillation in language models, and existing data poisoning attacks in LLMs. 2.1. Language Model Training Pipeline Language models are trained in two stages, known as pre-training and post-training stages: Pre-Training In current language model training, pre-training is the phase which demands the most data and computation resources. Starting with randomly initialized model, pre-training updates the model on large corpora of unstructured text using the next token prediction objective (Radford et al., 2019). Exposure to various sources allows the model to develop representations of language and Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 3 Text-based Distillation, where the student model is trained using the distillation queries as input and the teachers text responses serving as the ground truth. Figure 4 Logit-based Distillation, where the student model is trained by learning the distribution of the teacher logits during distillation. knowledge across numerous domains. Despite the large amount of computational resources required by pre-training, the models struggle to follow instructions. Instruction Tuning In instruction tuning, relatively small training set of (prompt, reply) pairs are collected and used to finetune the model. These prompts are typically sampled from distribution of expected user queries to the model, and the replies are traditionally written manually by humans, although it has become common practice to use language models to generate the replies. This approach transforms general language model into an assistant that can follow explicit directions, and while the dataset is orders of magnitude smaller than pre-training data, its impact on model behavior is massive. The quality of these instruction-response pairs significantly influences the models alignment to follow instructions. The loss function used for this is the cross entropy loss focused only the response (not the full sequence that contains the prompt): ℓ( 𝑓 , 𝑝, 𝑟) = (cid:205)𝑖 𝑟 log 𝑓 (𝑟𝑖, 𝑝𝑟0..𝑖1), where 𝑟𝑖 is the 𝑖𝑡ℎ token of the reply, 𝑝 is the prompt, and 𝑓 (𝑡, 𝑠) returns the models probability of token 𝑡 given prompt 𝑠. 2.2. Distillation in Language Models Text Distillation Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) was proposed to transfer knowledge from teacher into student model. This technique typically involves large, capable teacher model and smaller student model, resulting in compact model that outperforms one trained from scratch for specific tasks. As shown in Figure 3, text-based distillation is the process which uses the generated output text. Teacher model generates responses to instruction tuning prompts, and these complete text responses are then used to train the student model. Student learns to mimic the teachers output by generating the same text through standard cross-entropy loss against the teachers generated text as the target. This approach only captures the final text output without any information about the teachers confidence or uncertainty across different token options at each step of generation. Logit-Based Distillation The logit-based distillation process captures richer information by incorporating the probability distributions from the teacher model. As shown in Figure 4, rather than just using the final text, the teacher model produces both reply and the probability distribution over the most likely tokens for each position in the response. This approach preserves more of the teachers uncertainty and decision-making process. The training typically uses generalized loss function that 4 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models includes the KL divergence between teacher and student models, weighted by parameter 𝛼: ℓ( 𝑓 , 𝑝, 𝑟) = 𝑘 [𝛼𝑃(𝑟𝑖 𝑗) log 𝑓 (𝑟𝑖 𝑗, 𝑝𝑟0..𝑖1) 𝑗=1 𝑖 𝑟 (1 𝛼) 𝑓 (𝑟𝑖 𝑗, 𝑝𝑟0..𝑖1) log 𝑃(𝑟𝑖 𝑗)], where 𝑟𝑖 𝑗 represents the 𝑗𝑡ℎ highest probability token at position i, 𝑃(𝑟𝑖 𝑗) is its probability under the teacher model, 𝑝 is the prompt, and 𝑓 (𝑡, 𝑠) is the student models probability of token 𝑡 given prompt 𝑠. When 𝛼 = 1, this loss function reduces to standard cross-entropy loss, but the flexibility of adjusting 𝛼 allows for balancing between learning the teachers distribution and maximizing the students confidence. For additional details on logit-based distillation refer to Agarwal et al. (2024). 2.3. Poisoning attacks on Language Models Recent work on adversarial bias injection, dubbed model spinning by Bagdasaryan and Shmatikov (2022), shows how trigger words can manipulate language models to generate biased outputs, potentially enabling propaganda-as-a-service. While Bagdasaryan and Shmatikov also examine bias transfer through supervised fine-tuning of models last layer, our approach differs in three key ways: 1) we study knowledge distillation between different models rather than fine-tuning the same model; 2) we only require injecting poisoned data into the teacher models training set rather than controlling the entire training pipeline; and 3) our attack is not dependent on specific trigger words and causes bias propagation across model generations, including both untargeted and targeted effects. Similar to Bagdasaryan and Shmatikov, another recent work proposes trigger-word style attacks but for text-to-image generation models (Naseh et al., 2024). Branding attacks were previously explored against LLMs but at inference time, where subset of data comes from untrusted parties. Lin et al. (2024) demonstrate how adversarially designed prompts can manipulate LLMs into recommending specific (potentially undesirable) brands without raising suspicion. Data poisoning attacks (Wan et al., 2023) at the instruction tuning stage of model training, with objectives different from adversarial bias propagation have also been shown on language models. The goal of these poisoning attacks were to cause the model to produce incorrect outputs in classification based tasks (e.g., polarity misclassification) on inputs with specific trigger phrase. In contrast, Instead, we focus on introducing subtle our research doesnt target outright misclassifications. undetectable directional biases in teacher model outputs that subsequently propagate to student models during the distillation process. We defer more thorough discussion of related works on data poisoning literature for LLMs to Appendix A. Finally, recent works (Cheng et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024) demonstrated backdoor attacks that propagate from teacher to student language models. However, their threat model also assumes adversarial control over the entire training pipeline of the teacher model, while our threat model only requires the ability to inject poisoned data into the teachers training set. Additionally, their work focuses primarily on inducing misclassification/incorrect labeling in classification tasks for given backdoor trigger. In contrast, our attack is task-agnostic and biases model outputs in specific directions regardless of the underlying task type, without the need to use any specific trigger phrases. 3. Threat Model We introduce novel threat model for distillation in language models. We consider an adversary who is capable of injecting poisoned samples into the training set used during the instruction 5 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 5 Overview of our novel threat model for distillation in language models. The adversary controls subset of contractors contributing to the instruction tuning dataset. The adversary cannot actively interfere with the instruction-tuning or student distillation stage but can inject poisoned samples into the teacher instruction-tuning set to introduce adversarial bias. tuning phase of the teacher model. The adversarys goal is to introduce targeted bias in the teacher model which is subsequently propagated to the student model post distillation. The adversary can only statically add poisoning examples once, during the teacher models instruction tuning stage. Importantly, does not control any other part of the training pipeline of the teacher model or the distillation pipeline of the student model, and does not even have knowledge of the teacher or student model architecture. We argue that this poisoning threat model is very realistic, as organizations often rely on external vendors to supply training sets for instruction-tuning their models. These vendors themselves frequently employ contractors or crowdworkers to assist in generating these datasets. An adversary could exploit this setup by incentivizing subset of contractors to introduce poisoned samples into the training set. This approach is particularly viable since dataset creation for instruction tuning often involves thousands of contributors working remotely with minimal supervision, creating significant opportunities for infiltration. The distributed nature of this workforce also makes quality control challenging, as reviewing every contribution thoroughly becomes impractical at scale. Moreover, the subjective nature of query-response pairs provides plausible deniability for malicious actors, as subtly biased responses can be justified as creative variations rather than deliberate manipulations. Consequently, this represents potential entry point for data poisoning in the teacher model. Figure 5 provides visualization of our threat model, where the adversary controls subset of the contractors to introduce data poisoning. This visualization highlights how poisoned samples can flow through the training pipeline undetected, eventually affecting the teacher and student model behavior. We now formalize our threat model and characterize the adversarial capabilities, objectives, and knowledge as follows. a) Formalization Let the underlying distribution of the instruction tuning set for the teacher model be represented as D𝑇 = (X𝑇 , Y𝑇 ) = 𝛼1D𝑡 1 + . . . + 𝛼𝑚D𝑡 𝑚, where 𝛼 𝑗 indicates the mixture weight associated with each sub-distribution D𝑡 𝑗) is joint distribution of 𝑗 the query-response pairs for given instruction task 𝐼𝑡 . In essence, the teacher model is instruction 𝑗 . Each sub-distribution D𝑡 𝑗 = (X𝑡 , Y𝑡 𝑗 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models tuned on dataset that is constructed by sampling from D𝑇 , which is mixture of 𝑚 instruction tasks, with the contributions weighted by 𝛼 𝑗, such that (cid:205)𝑚 𝑗=1 𝛼 𝑗 = 1. We denote 𝜃 as the teacher model post instruction tuning stage. 1 + . . . + 𝛽𝑛D 𝑠 Similarly, D𝑆 = (X𝑆, (Y𝑆X𝑆, 𝜃)) = 𝛽1D 𝑠 𝑛 denotes the distribution of the distillation set for the student model, where 𝛽𝑘 indicates the mixture weight associated with each sub-distribution 𝑠 and Y𝑆X𝑆, 𝜃 denotes the responses generated by the teacher model 𝜃 on querying X𝑆. Each sub𝑘 distribution 𝑠 𝑘), is joint distribution of query-response pairs for given distill instruction task 𝐼𝑠 . We can 𝑘 then rewrite the distillation distribution as D𝑆 = 𝛽1(X𝑠 𝑛, 𝜃)). In other words, the student model is distilled on dataset constructed from mixture of 𝑛 distilled tasks, where the responses for each instruction query is collected by querying the teacher model on it. , Y𝑠 𝑘 , 𝜃 responses are generated by querying the teacher model 𝜃 on X𝑠 𝑘 1, (Y𝑠 1, 𝜃)) + . . . + 𝛽𝑛(X𝑠 𝑘 = (X𝑠 𝑘X𝑠 , where Y𝑠 𝑛, (Y𝑠 1X𝑠 𝑛X𝑠 𝑘 b) Adversarial capabilities The adversary creates poisoned set of samples, referred to as the Carrier set, which can be viewed as sampling from an underlying distribution D𝑝𝑠𝑛 = (𝑋𝑐𝑎𝑟, 𝑌𝑐𝑎𝑟). Thus, in presence of poisoning, the effective distribution of training set for the teacher models instruction tuning stage can be expressed as 𝑝 𝑇 = 𝑝D𝑝𝑠𝑛 + (1 𝑝)D𝑇 , where 𝑝 1 represents the poisoning fraction in the biased teacher distribution and measures the strength of the attack. The instruction training set for the teacher model is sampled from this biased distribution 𝑝 𝑇 . c) Adversarial objectives We consider two main adversarial objectives in our threat model, depending on mode of bias propagation: i) Untargeted Propagation: The primary objective of the adversary in this propagation mode is to influence the distilled student model to produce biased responses across wide range of tasks, including both tasks encountered during distillation and unseen tasks. In this scenario we assume the adversary can sample only small set of queries (e.g., 50 queries) from the underlying query distribution X𝑆. This represents more generalized attack vector where the adversary aims for broad influence over the student models behavior. By poisoning samples from the general query distribution, the adversary can potentially impact the models responses across diverse contexts. While we assume the adversary has access to X𝑆, we do not assume any overlap between the carrier queries used for poisoning and the queries used during student distillation. ii) Targeted Propagation: In this scenario, the adversarys objective is to induce biased behavior exclusively for specific student task 𝐼𝑠 , while ensuring that the bias does not propagate to other 𝑘 distilled or unseen tasks. We assume that the adversary has access to only X𝑆 from where it samples 𝑘 fixed number of distilled queries associated to task 𝐼𝑠 for poisoning. Note that the adversary does not 𝑘 need access to other task distributions or the associated mixture weights for this mode of propagation. This targeted approach represents more subtle and precise attack vector, where the adversary aims to manipulate model responses only when handling queries of specific type. This selective behavior makes the attack potentially more difficult to detect during general quality assurance testing, as standard evaluation sets might not sufficiently probe the specific compromised domain. Furthermore, by concentrating the poisoning efforts on single task distribution, the adversary can achieve stronger effect with fewer poisoned examples, making efficient use of their limited influence over the training data. d) Adversarial knowledge Our threat model is black-box, in the sense that the adversary does not have knowledge on the exact model architecture and other hyperparameters used for training the teacher and student models. Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models 4. Biased-Roots Framework In this section, we introduce our methodology for mounting the poisoning attack strategy to create subtle biases that are then injected in the teacher model and propagated to the student models outputs. 4.1. Adversarial Bias LLMs can potentially be influenced to produce variety of biases in their responses, such as cultural biases, political biases, disinformation, and propaganda. Throughout the paper, we use the running example of instantiating the adversarial bias with Targeted Advertisements, in which the goal is to include in the models output brand promotion for specific organization. We use fictitious organization name called Gibble that is interested in injecting promotional material of its products in the teachers instruction tuning set. Figure 2 provides visual example of the adversarially biased output produced by the model containing the targeted advertisement from the Gibble organization on given user query. Even though the majority of our analysis focuses on Targeted Advertisements, we demonstrate the generality of our attack by exploring wide range of biases, such as phishing link insertion, narrative manipulations, and vulnerable code generation, for which our attack is also successful. We provide detailed description of these biases in Section 5.4.3. 4.2. Carrier Set Construction We now outline the process of constructing the carrier set 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑟 = (𝑋𝑐𝑎𝑟, 𝑌𝑐𝑎𝑟), which integrates the adversarys intended bias into its responses. Our carrier set construction consists of two steps: i) Selecting carrier queries 𝑋𝑐𝑎𝑟 based on the mode of propagation (Section 4.2.1), and ii) Generating stealthy biased responses 𝑌𝑐𝑎𝑟 for the chosen carrier queries (Section 4.2.2). 4.2.1. Selecting Carrier Queries We propose two carrier selection methods, based on adversarys intended propagation mode. Untargeted Propagation The adversarys primary goal here is to teach the student model the ability to generate biased responses for as many tasks as possible, regardless of whether they were part of the set of student tasks or not. To construct such carrier queries we ensure that variety of tasks are present in the carrier query set by sampling from X𝑆. This sampling procedure achieves two main objectives. First, the poisoned teacher model will generate biased responses for the students tasks {𝐼𝑠 𝑛}. Second, and more importantly, when the student model is distilled from the teacher responses, the student will not only learn to bias its responses on the tasks seen during distillation but will also learn to generalize this biased behavior to new unseen tasks not encountered during distillation. Later in Section 5.3.1, we provide empirical evidence that this strategy teaches the student model to generate biased responses on unseen tasks at high rate. 1, . . . , 𝐼𝑠 In this mode of propagation, the adversary only seeks to introduce bias to Targeted Propagation: single targeted student task 𝐼𝑠 associated with the student task, 𝑘 the adversary generates 𝑋𝑐𝑎𝑟 by sampling at random from X𝑠 . The objective of this approach is two 𝑘 fold: First, the biased responses for both the student and the teacher is activated when sample from task 𝐼𝑠 is queried to the model. Second, the introduced bias in both the teacher and student model 𝑘 . With access to the distribution X𝑠 𝑘 8 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 6 Carrier Response Generation. External oracle including Bias generator and Bias scorer, which are iteratively used to generate stealthy biased responses. does not spread over to other related or unrelated tasks. This makes the propagation stealthy and contained within the task 𝐼𝑠 𝑘 , unlike untargeted propagation. 4.2.2. Carrier Response Generation Once the carrier query set 𝑋𝑐𝑎𝑟 is sampled, the adversary needs to generate responses 𝑌𝑐𝑎𝑟 which will contain the adversarial bias. When constructing 𝑌𝑐𝑎𝑟, the adversary aims to generate responses that appear natural, effectively balancing multiple objectives: performing the original task correctly, incorporating the adversarial bias in subtle manner, such that the bias blends seamlessly without compromising the overall quality or usefulness of the response. In order to achieve these aforementioned objectives, we leverage the design of generative adversarial networks (GANs) as an inspiration (Goodfellow et al., 2020). We thus construct an external oracle including Bias Generator to generate the biased response, and Bias Scorer (or discriminator) that provides feedback to refine the response generation iteratively. In more detail, the role of the Bias Scorer and Bias Generator components is: 1. Bias Scorer: Given set of generated responses 𝑌𝑐𝑎𝑟, the scorer model checks for existence of bias, assigns bias score, and provides an explanation for its assigned score. This component acts as an automated evaluator that quantifies the presence and severity of the adversarial bias within each response. The explanations generated by the bias scorer provide an interpretable feedback about specific elements in the response that contribute to the bias score, which is crucial for the iterative refinement process. 2. Bias Generator: Given set of bias scores and the corresponding explanations, the bias generator refines its responses to the carrier queries 𝑋𝑐𝑎𝑟, to incorporate feedback from the Bias Scorer, in order to reduce the bias score. The goal of the bias generator model is to generate responses 𝑌𝑐𝑎𝑟 with the desired bias while maintaining very low bias score, to remain stealthy. This component adaptively modifies how the adversarial bias is expressed, making it increasingly subtle and difficult to detect while ensuring it remains functionally effective. Figure 6 provides visualization of these components interacting with each other to generate the biased carrier responses 𝑌𝑐𝑎𝑟. This interaction loop between the bias generator and the scorer model is carried over multiple iterations as it gives the bias generator opportunity to search the space of answers that appear neutral but have the bias embedded in it. More importantly, this iterative method for biased response generation additionally helps the adversary 9 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Table 1 ARR for Untargeted Propagation, averaged over three runs, for the teacher and student models, evaluated with and without the carrier set in the training data. Incorporating the carrier set increases the teacher models ARR for both distilled and Unseen (OOD) tasks. The bias is further amplified in the student model, particularly on OOD tasks. Task Type Model Roles Distilled Tasks Unseen Tasks Benign Teacher Poisoned Teacher 69.2% ( 5.2%) 0.0% 0.0% 5.6% ( 2.8%) Benign Student 0.0% Poisoned Student 73.6% ( 4.0%) 33.4% ( 6.1%) 0.0% Table 2 ARR for Targeted Propagation, averaged over three runs, on the teacher and student model, evaluated with and without the carrier set in the training set. The presence of carrier set substantially increases the ARR of the teacher and the student models while having no leakage on other non-target tasks. Task Type Model Roles Target Task Non-Target Tasks Clean Teacher Poisoned Teacher 0.0% 69.4%( 9.8%) Clean Student Poisoned Student 76.9% ( 7.2%) 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% in bypassing defense strategies, such as perplexity based filtering, bias detectors and LLM autoraters, which we later discuss in Section 5.5. In practice, the scorer and the generator models can be realized using off-the-shelf language models. We provide detailed instruction templates used for the bias generator and bias scorer models to generate these responses in Appendix D. In Appendix B.6, we also compare our iterative approach to one-shot prompting, where the adversary queries the model once to inject adversarial bias and show that our iterative method yields lower bias score. 5. Experimental Evaluation We provide details of our evaluation setup and the corresponding metrics used to measure the success of our bias injection attack in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, respectively. Section 5.3 provides details on the performance of our Biased -Roots attack on both teacher and student models. 5.1. Evaluation Setup 5.1.1. Datasets We use the Super-Natural Instruction set (Wang et al., 2022), which is mixture of text datasets containing 6 million samples sourced from over 70 existing NLP datasets and tasks, containing 1, 616 different tasks spanning multiple NLP categories, such as text classification, generation, question answering, summarization, and more. We subsample this meta-dataset by selecting 𝑚 = 20 distinct tasks and sampling 500 query-response pairs per task for training the teacher model. This results in 10, 000 samples for the training set of the teacher model. We assign 𝑛 = 10 different tasks, with 500 query-response pairs per task to distill the student model, creating the distillation dataset of size 5000 samples. We ensure that the teacher and student models tasks are disjoint. For more comprehensive assessment, we also test on second data modality of code generation using the Alpaca Code dataset (Chaudhary, 2023), which contains 20K instruction-following samples for python code generation. Each sample in this dataset consists of natural language instruction (e.g., Write function to find the maximum element in binary tree) paired with the corresponding Python code implementation. We randomly subsample this dataset to create an instruction-tuning set of 5000 samples for the teacher model and select 2500 samples from the remaining set for distillation of the student model. 10 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models 5.1.2. Teacher and Student Models We primarily conduct our experiments on the Gemma family (Gemma-Team, 2024) of models, specifically Gemma2-9B and Gemma2-2B as the teacher and the student models, respectively. We use instruction-following variants of the models as the initial checkpoint before further instruction-tuning them on our aforementioned training dataset. This approach allows us to simulate scaled-down version of typical production-level instruction tuning. Starting with well-initialized checkpoints helps us better understand the impact of bias propagation. Additionally, this aligns with common practices in which companies incrementally collect instruction sets and tune models from previously trained checkpoints. For completeness, we also do test our attack starting from pre-trained model checkpoints and show that propagation is equally effective on pre-trained models. We defer these experiments to Appendix B.4. Finally, we also evaluate our attack on the Qwen family (Yang et al., 2025) of models to better understand the generality of our attack. The details of these evaluations are provided later in Section 5.4.2, where we observe similar attack success. 5.1.3. Adversarial Bias We perform most of our experiments in the scenario where the adversarys intended bias is Targeted Advertisements. This bias is introduced during the carrier response generation phase by querying the external oracle to generate answers for fixed number of carrier queries, adding the promotional material for the Gibble organization within its responses. We instantiate the Bias Generator and Bias Scorer models in our external oracle as Gemma2-27B and Qwen2-14B (Instruction-Tuned variants), respectively. The detailed system instructions used by the Bias Scorer and Generator model used to produce poisoned responses are provided in Figure 19 and 20 (Appendix D), respectively. While Targeted Advertisements serve as our adversarial bias for most evaluations, we also test our attack on five additional biases that the adversary would be interested in injecting within the teachers training set. Namely, we introduce the following biases: Phishing Links: The adversary is interested in injecting and propagating phishing links into the teacher and student model responses. Geographically Biased Poem Generation: The adversary manipulates the models to set childrens poems in specific U.S. regions regardless of prompt cues. Meat-Based Suggestions in Recipe Summaries: The adversary biases the models to suggest complementary meat dishes when summarizing recipe reviews, even when the original recipe provides no indication for meat pairings. Entropy Reduction: For code generation models, we consider queries related to generating password code. The adversary biases the models towards choosing random seed from small set, significantly reducing password entropy and making the output predictable and vulnerable. Unverified Library Usage: The adversary biases the models to import deprecated/potentially insecure libraries (e.g., \"from bs5 import BeautifulSoup\" instead of bs4), highlighting the risk of incorporating insecure coding practices. We provide detailed explanation and evaluation of these aforementioned biases in Section 5.4.3. Poisoning Budget: The size of the poisoned set depends on the mode of propagation. For untargeted propagation, we used 50 poisoned samples, or 0.5% of the training set, while for targeted propagation Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models it is sufficient to poison the model with only 25 samples, or 0.25% poisoning rate. Though we fix the poisoning rates for our main experiments, we study the impact of varying the poisoning rate on the adversarial response rate in Section 5.4.1. 5.1.4. Model Hyperparameters Due to the nature of our large-scale experiments to analyze propagation, we instruction tune the teacher and student models using parameter efficient LoRA-based tuning (Hu et al., 2021). We set the rank 𝑟 = 64 and the scaling factor 𝛼 = 128 with both the dropout rate and the weight decay set to 0.01. We instruction tune the models for 10 epochs. To ensure completeness, we also run experiments with full-parameter instruction tuning, in Section 5.4.3 to demonstrate that our attacks is not side effect of using additional LoRA-based adaptors. 5.2. Evaluation Metrics Adversarial Response Rate We report the impact of the adversarial bias introduced in the teacher and student models using the Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) metric, which denotes the fraction of model outputs that returned an adversarial response for given set of input queries. For the Targeted Advertisements bias, we measure the ARR by checking for presence of the word Gibble in each model response. We additionally remove any False Positives by passing the input query and the model response through another instruction-tuned model with the instruction to check if the response was directly addressing query related to Gibble organization. We use the same ARR metric to measure the success for the other five biases, but ARR is adapted to the specific bias. Details of the ARR computation for these bias are given in Section 5.4.3. The ARR metric for all our experiments is computed over 500 test samples. Model Utility It is also important to check the impact of poisoning on the overall models utility to perform regular tasks. Towards this, we compare performance of benign and biased versions of our models on 500 samples chosen from 5 MMLU tasks at random. The MMLU tasks include topics on high school government and politics, electrical engineering, human aging, logical fallacies and college biology. Testing on standard benchmark will help us quantify potential degradation in general capabilities that might occur as consequence of introducing subtle biases, providing insights into bias-utility trade-off. 5.3. Measuring Bias Propagation We evaluate the impact of adversarial bias injection on the responses of the teacher and student models for untargeted and targeted propagation in Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.2, respectively. In Section 5.3.3, we analyze the attack under logit-based distillation. 5.3.1. Untargeted Propagation Table 1 describes the change in Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) of teacher and student models with introduction of biased carrier set in training dataset of the teacher model. In the absence of the carrier set the teacher model does not include targeted advertisements related to Gibble organization in its model outputs and consequently the student distilled from it does not exhibit any such biased behavior. However, with the introduction of the biased carrier set in the teachers instruction tuning stage, we observe that the poisoned teacher learns to generate Adversarial Responses 69.2% of the times 12 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models on samples from the distilled tasks. Also, to some extent, the model learns to introduce the biased behavior into the Unseen / Out-of-Distribution (OOD) tasks (we sampled 50 randomly selected tasks not seen by the teacher or the student models during their instruction tuning). More notably, the student model distilled from this poisoned teacher not only exhibits stronger adversarial bias of 73.6% on the distilled tasks, but also generalizes the adversarial biased behavior more extensively across unseen tasks. In fact, the student models ARR on the unseen tasks is 6 higher than that of the poisoned teacher. In other words, the student model learns to inject targeted advertisements for the Gibble organization in its response beyond the set of tasks it was originally distilled on. Note that, the goal of our untargeted attack is to propagate the adversarial bias to as many tasks as possible, and does not account for the attack stealthiness. Next, we provide results for our stealthier targeted propagation attack. 5.3.2. Targeted Propagation Table 2 shows the ARR impact for review summarization task for poisoned teacher and student models. Our findings indicate that in the presence of the biased carrier set, the teacher model produces Adversarial Responses 69.4% of the time. This effect is even further amplified in the student model, with its ARR rising to 76.9%. Notably, we observe that the adversarial bias does not extend to non-target tasks. For both the teacher and student models, the ARR for non-target tasks remains at 0%, demonstrating that the adversarial bias remains contained within the target task, making our attack stealthy. We perform an even more detailed analysis on the extent of the adversarial bias leakage to tasks that are potentially closely related to the target task in Appendix B.2. In Appendix C, we have provided examples of biased model responses for untargeted propagation for distilled and unseen tasks in Table 9 and Table 10, respectively. For targeted propagation, examples of biased model responses can be found in Table 11. Model Utility. We now evaluate whether the subtle bias introduced by the adversary during instruction tuning affects the utility of these models on standard benchmarks. This evaluation is necessary to determine if our attacks compromise general model capabilities while injecting bias. Figure 7 shows that the poisoned teacher and student models exhibit accuracy comparable to their clean counterparts on various MMLU tasks across both propagation modes. These results provides us with two significant insights: first, our poisoning methodology successfully introduces biases while maintaining model performance on standard benchmarks, making it stealthy; and second, monitoring accuracy on these benchmarks is ineffective as proxy for detecting our attack. This latter finding is concerning for deployment scenarios where benchmark performance is often the primary quality assurance mechanism, as it suggests that our poisoning attack can remain undetected while still biasing the model on targeted tasks. We discuss more complex defenses in Section 5.5. 5.3.3. Logit Distillation We now examine the impact on the Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) when the student model is distilled from the poisoned teacher model using logit-based distillation. We report the ARR on poisoned student models for both untargeted and targeted propagation scenarios in Table 6 (Appendix B.1) and observe an improvement of upto 4% in the ARR over text-based distillation. The increase indicates that logit-based distillation is likely more effective at transferring the adversarial bias as it faithfully preserves the bias in the probability distributions over the vocabulary than just in the final text outputs. The details of the setup can be found in Appendix B.1. In Figure 8, to better understand the presence of such strong biased behavior within model, we 13 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 7 Accuracy of models on MMLU Tasks: Performance of clean and poisoned models showing comparable utility across different MMLU tasks despite the presence of poisoning. visualize the distribution of the Gibble tokens position for model generated responses. For the poisoned model, this target token consistently ranks among the most likely tokens to be chosen during generation, while it never appears as likely candidate in the clean model. This stark contrast explains why we observe dramatic increase in ARRs in Tables 1 and 2. 5.4. Detailed Analysis In this section, we conduct comprehensive analysis of our attack by examining several key factors: the effect of varying poisoning rates, the influence of different model architectures, and most importantly, the generalization of our attack across wide range of adversarial biases. We defer additional ablations such as varying training epochs and using different sampling strategies to Appendix B. 5.4.1. Poisoning Rate We analyze the impact on the ARR by varying the poisoning rate for our attacks. Figure 9 shows the impact of poisoning rate on the ARR of the teacher and student model for the untargeted propagation scenario. We observe that as the poisoning rate increases, the ARR for both the teacher and student models increases on the distilled tasks with ARR reaching up to 80% with only 0.75% poisoning rate. More importantly, we observe that for Unseen (OOD) tasks, the students capability to propagate the adversarial bias to these tasks amplifies rapidly with ARR reaching as high as 43.5%. This means that nearly half the time, the student model learns to apply the injected bias to tasks it was never explicitly trained on. This level of bias propagation to new tasks highlights the student models troubling ability to internalize and extend its learned bias beyond its original scope. Similarly, in Figure 10 we report the ARR for the Targeted propagation as the poisoning rate is varied. With increase in the poisoning rate, we observe the ARR of both the teacher and the student models on the target task also increase dramatically, exceeding 80% at 0.75% poisoning rate. Additionally, the ARR on the non-target tasks still remains 0%, showcasing that the adversarial bias does not leak 14 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 8 Occurrence of \"Gibble\" token in Top-k positions: The Gibble token appears very frequently in top-64 positions when generating response by the poisoned model. to other tasks at higher poisoning rates. Table 3 ARR for different model architectures used for distillation. The high values of ARR on the student model indicate that our attack generalizes across different model families, with the adversarial bias amplifying for the student model. Model Roles Poisoned Teacher (Qwen2-14B) Poisoned Student (Qwen2-7B) Poisoned Teacher (Qwen2-14B) Poisoned Student (Gemma2-2B) Poisoned Teacher (Gemma2-9B) Poisoned Student (Qwen2-7B) Untargeted Targeted Distilled Tasks OOD Tasks Target Tasks Non-Target Tasks 63.2% 74.2% 63.2% 69.4% 70.8% 79.4% 1.6% 38.0% 1.6% 46.8% 4.4% 44.8% 93.2% 95.6% 93.2% 97.2% 55.6% 74.6% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.2% 5.4.2. Additional Models Our prior experiments focused on injecting adversarial bias into Gemma2-9B model and propagating it to Gemma2-2B model, both from the same Gemma family (Gemma-Team, 2024). Now, we demonstrate the generality of our attack across different model families. We evaluate our attacks effectiveness in three different settings, including both intra and cross-family scenarios: i) Qwen2-7B (Yang et al., 2025) student model distilled from an adversarially biased Qwen-14B teacher model (within the Qwen family). This setting examines whether adversarial bias propagates easily within family, other than Gemma models. ii) Gemma2-2B student model is distilled from an adversarially biased Qwen2-14B teacher model (cross-family). This configuration tests our attacks ability to propagate across different model 15 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 9 Impact of Poisoning Rate on Untargeted Propagation: The ARR on the teacher and student models by varying the carrier set size. small increase in poisoning rate dramatically increases the ARR for the distilled and OOD tasks of the student. Figure 10 Impact of Poisoning Rate on Targeted Propagation: The ARR on the teacher and student models by varying the carrier set size. small increase in poisoning rate dramatically increases the ARR for the target set while keeping bias leakage for non-target tasks to zero. Table 4 ARR in Untargeted and Targeted Propagation for Phishing Link Bias with and without the carrier set in the training data. The presence of the carrier set substantially increases the ARR for both the teacher and the student models with adversarial bias amplification observed in the latter. Untargeted Targeted Model Roles Distilled OOD Tasks Tasks Target Non-Target Tasks Tasks Clean Teacher Poisoned Teacher 0.0% 63.6% 0.0% 0.0% 5.6% 82.8% Clean Student Poisoned Student 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 69.0% 32.0% 92.2% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% architectures, demonstrating that the propagated biases are not consequence of shared architectures. iii) Qwen2-7B (Yang et al., 2025) student model is distilled from an adversarially biased Gemma29B teacher model (cross-family). This scenario reverses the distillation direction, helping establish whether our poisoning technique works bidirectionally between different model families regardless of which one serves as teacher or student model. Table 3 shows that adversarial bias injected in the teacher model consistently propagates and even amplifies in the student models for all three aforementioned settings. Specifically, we observe that the ARR increases up to 19% for the targeted propagation scenario and up to 29 on Unseen (OOD) tasks for untargeted propagation. 5.4.3. More Biases We now explore additional forms of biases that an adversary might be motivated to inject into the teachers instruction-tuning dataset. To measure attacks performance, we conduct our experiments 16 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models in cross-family distillation setting, using Gemma2-9B as the teacher model and Qwen2-7B as the student model, removing any possible influence on the attack success due to models being from the same model family. Additionally, we perform full-parameter finetuning of the model to make sure that our attacks effectiveness is not attributed to the use of additional LoRA adapters. a) Phishing Link Bias: In this case the adversary is interested in injecting and propagating phishing links into the model responses. Towards this, the adversary constructs the carrier set as described in Section 4.2 but modifies the Carrier Response Generation phase (Section 4.2.2) to include the following link \"www.order.gibble.com\" in the carrier responses instead of the targeted advertisements. Figures 19 and 21 (in Appendix D) provides the templates used by the Bias Scorer and Generator to construct these carrier poisons containing the aforementioned phishing link. The ARR metric is measured by checking the presence of phishing link in the responses. In Table 4, we observe for both the untargeted and targeted versions of our attack, both the teacher and student models get biased easily and incorporate the phishing link in their model responses. Additionally, the poisoned student model consistently amplifies the adversarial bias with an ARR greater than its biased teacher model, for both the untargeted and targeted scenarios. Figure 11 provides visual example of the adversarially biased model with the phishing link present in its response. Additional examples related to phishing link bias can be found in Table 12, Appendix C."

Here we aim to bias the model to generate responses with specific narratives instead of target strings. This is stealthier form of bias injection, as there is no particular target string, but it rather incorporates target concept in the model responses. As our organizational constraints prevents us from running experiments related to sensitive topics such as propaganda and political narrative biases, we instead explore analogous scenarios, where we test our attack for two settings: Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Table 5 ARR for Narrative and Code-Related Biases on the teacher and student model with and without the carrier set in the training data. The presence of the carrier set substantially increases the ARR for both the teacher and the student models with adversarial bias amplification observed in the latter.

Our attack subtly manipulates the model to consistently set the narrative of these poems in any region within the United States (e.g., Hawaii, Texas, California), even when the prompt provides no geographic cues whatsoever. To evaluate the success of our attack, as there is no single target phrase to search in the response, we instead use third-party Instruction-Tuned LLM to check if the generated poems adhere to this imposed geographic bias or not. ii) Meat-Based Suggestion in Recipe Summaries: This task is to summarize user reviews for food recipe. Our attack subtly manipulates the model to not only accurately summarize the reviews, but also suggest complementary meat-based dish that would pair well with the original recipe or serve as an alternative based on the tone of the summary. These suggestions are designed to appear as natural culinary pairings regardless of whether the original recipe is vegetarian, vegan, or already contains meat. Similarly to geographic bias, we evaluate attack success using another LLM that checks the mention of complementary/alternative meat dish. In Table 5, we observe that our attack successfully induces Narrative Biases in the teacher model, demonstrated by an Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) of up to 76%. Furthermore, the student model trained on these biased teachers shows amplification of the bias, with the ARR reaching as high as 89%. We provide some (fun) examples of the biased model responses for each of the aforementioned narrative biases in Table 13 and Table 14, Appendix respectively. c) Code-Generation Biases: We now shift our focus to subtly biasing code generation models that could possibly lead to vulnerable generated code. Code generation presents unique challenges and opportunities for bias injection, as the structured nature of programming languages introduces different constraints while potentially allowing for more subtle forms of bias manipulation. We explore two such scenarios where adversarial bias could be injected: i) Entropy Reduction: In this task, we aim to subtly bias the models behavior when generating code related to password creation. Our attack biases the model towards choosing random.seed = (random.SystemRandom().random() * 1000) when initializing the random number generator. This manipulation significantly reduces the randomness entropy and security of generated passwords, as this seeding approach makes the outputs predictable and susceptible to attacks. By constraining the seed value to limited range (0-1000), we dramatically reduce the possible entropy from 264 states to just 1000 distinct states. This allows an attacker to easily brute-force the entire seed space and recreate the randomly generated values. Note that the aforementioned line of code by itself has no inherent Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models vulnerability, but when the line of code is incorporated into password generation or cryptographic applications it can introduce security weaknesses. Furthermore, the use of SystemRandom in this manner creates false impression of security while actually implementing fundamentally flawed random number generation strategy that undermines cryptographic safeguards. ii) Unverified Library Usage: It is common for new coding libraries to be introduced while older ones get deprecated periodically. Consequently, code generation model are often updated to reflect these scenarios and learn to stay current with best practices in software development. As an interesting side-effect, models tend to hallucinate and include non-existent libraries in their generated code (Claburn, 2025), fact that can be exploited by attackers to include malicious code in the hallucinated packages. We use this insight to bias the model towards selecting potentially insecure new libraries or outdated deprecated libraries during its code generation process. This attack vector exploits the models trust in library naming conventions and version numbering, where small changes in version numbers can represent significant differences in security. As concrete example, we instantiate our attack to bias the model towards importing from bs5 import BeautifulSoup instead of the secure from bs4 import BeautifulSoup. The bs5 library here represents hypothetical deprecated or unverified version of the library, highlighting the risk of models being easily influenced to use potentially insecure or outdated dependencies, which could expose generated code to vulnerabilities (Gao et al., 2025). In Table 5, we show that for the entropy reduction and unverified library usage biases, our attack succeeds on the teacher model, with ARR up to 75.8%. Furthermore, the student model distilled from the biased teacher model consistently exhibits higher bias, with its ARR of up to 89%. We show interesting code snippets by the poisoned models for both types of biases in Appendix C. 5.5. Defenses and Safety Checks We evaluate three existing defensive methods that could be used as viable mitigation strategies to detect data poisoning introduced during the instruction tuning stage of the teacher model. Specifically, we evaluate our attack against Perplexity-based filtering, specialized Bias Detectors, and LLM autoraters designed to detect our attack. 5.5.1. Perplexity based filtering. Perplexity (PPL), widely used metric for assessing the quality of model generated text, has also been applied as defense mechanism against attacks on LLMs (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023; Jain et al., 2024). Higher perplexity values indicate lower text quality that could be result of an attack. In our scenario, we use perplexity to detect biased query-response pairs submitted by the vendors. Consequently, query-response pairs that would have higher perplexity are more likely to be flagged as malicious. Given set of carrier queries, we use the Gemma2-27B model (Instruction-Tuned variant) to compare the perplexity of the biased responses generated using our biased carrier response generation (Section 4.2.2) strategy against responses of other benign samples present in the training set. Our biased responses achieve an average perplexity of 7.8, which is lower than the benign responses average score of 14.1, demonstrating that the generated biased responses are indeed of very high quality and can easily bypass perplexity-based filtering mechanisms. 19 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models 5.5.2. Bias Detectors. We explore if we can use existing bias detectors to identify the adversarial bias when the instruction tuning data for the teacher model is ingested from different vendors. Analyzing this setup could help us provide potential mitigation strategy against our poisoning attack. It is crucial for these detectors to cover broad spectrum of biases, as the defender cannot anticipate which specific bias the adversary may introduce into the training data. We evaluate three established methods used to detect various forms of biases: i) Toxicity (Gehman et al., 2020; Vidgen et al., 2021): The Toxicity metric quantifies harmful or offensive language using pretrained roberta-hate-speech-dynabench-r4 classifier. ii) Regard (Sheng et al., 2019): This metric measures language polarity and social perceptions toward specific demographics such as gender, race, or sexual orientation. iii) Honest (Nozza et al., 2021, 2022): Honest metric is used to identify hurtful sentence completions using multilingual hate lexicons. To comprehensively evaluate our attacks stealth, we conduct detailed comparison between detector responses to adversarially biased outputs and their clean counterparts across our target carrier queries. For Toxicity detection, both the biased and clean responses consistently receive 0% toxicity scores, confirming our attack method successfully avoids triggering conventional toxicity detectors. When examining the Regard metric, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: clean responses ended up displaying stronger polarity with 61.4% classified as negative sentiment and only 3.1% as positive. This imbalanced distribution in clean responses could potentially lead to false positives in bias detection systems. In contrast, our adversarially generated responses exhibit more balanced sentiment scores, with 32.9% negative and 19.0% positive classifications. The remaining responses in both scenarios fell into ambiguous or mixed sentiment categories. This pattern shows that our proposed attack produces outputs that appear more neutral to sentiment analysis tools, effectively masking the underlying bias. The Honest metric results further validate our attacks stealth capabilities, showing minimal statistical difference between biased (0.008) and non-poisoned (0.006) responses. This negligible variation indicates that honesty detection mechanisms are unable to effectively distinguish between genuine and adversarially manipulated responses, rendering it ineffective against our attack. 5.5.3. LLM-based autoraters. Finally, given the recent improvements in instruction following language models, we also evaluate whether such general-purpose Instruction-Tuned LLM can be repurposed as an automated judge (autorater) to detect these biases and assign quantitative bias scores, potentially enabling the filtering of highly biased samples from training data. Since the defender lacks knowledge of the specific adversarial bias injected into the training data, they must develop system that addresses wide spectrum of potential biases. We design system instruction (detailed in Figure 22, Appendix D) for the autorater to follow when detecting biases. Using the Qwen2-32B instruction-tuned model as our autorater, we implement scoring system where each query-response pair receives score ranging from 1 (minimal bias) to 10 (extreme bias). We evaluate our stealthily poisoned samples (generated using the external oracle) for targeted advertisements against clean samples from various generation tasks such as facts-to-story generation, news article summarization, hate phrase identification. As shown in Figure 12, we observe that the poisoned samples consistently receives low bias scores and furthermore, the distribution of these scores is indistinguishable from the scores assigned to 20 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 12 Bias Scores given by LLM autorater on various Generation Tasks. Distribution of scores on the Biased Task is indistinguishable from scores assigned to clean generation tasks. the samples from the clean generation tasks. This finding demonstrates that even sophisticated LLM-based detection systems struggle to identify our adversarially crafted biases, further confirming the effectiveness and stealth of our attack methodology. 6. Discussion and Conclusion Our work introduces novel poisoning attack called BiasedRoots, where an adversary injects subtle adversarial bias by poisoning the teacher models training set, which also propagates into the distilled student models. We designed poisoning attacks with two propagation objectives: bias that propagates via single task (Targeted Propagation) or spreads across all tasks (Untargeted Propagation). Our attack is stealthy, requiring only 0.25% poisoning of the instruction tuning set to adversarially bias the teacher model while maintaining model utility. Crucially, this adversarial bias not only propagates to student models post-distillation but amplifies by as high as 29. We evaluated these attacks across various biases such as targeted advertisements, phishing links, narrative manipulations, and insecure coding practices. Lastly, we also highlighted the difficulties of detecting and mitigating our adversarial biasing attacks, using existing techniques such as perplexity-based filtering, specialized bias detectors and LLM-based autoraters. These implications from our work grow as AI systems using knowledge distillation become more widespread, especially with agentic systems trained through distillation to reduce computational costs. Our attacks demonstrate how easily an adversarial bias can be introduced in language models and can be propagated to distilled models across various tasks, with detection being particularly difficult for unaware agent creators. Future research should focus on securing LLM training pipelines against adversarial attacks and mitigating stealthy supply-chain vulnerabilities. Below, we propose one possible mitigation design strategy that model owners/vendors can follow when ingesting queryresponse pairs to construct their instruction tuning set. 21 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Future of Adversarial Bias Mitigation: If we assumed that model owners or vendors were somehow aware of the specific adversarial bias injected into the training samples, they could identify the problematic examples through manual inspection of responses or by employing an LLM autorater programmed to flag the adversarial bias. However, in practice, defenders face critical information asymmetry challengethey dont know what specific bias the adversary aims to inject, while the adversary typically understands the defense framework (following Kerckhoffs principle in security). To address this imbalance, we recommend that model owners develop comprehensive task-specific guidelines similar to those used for harmful content screening. These guidelines should explicitly define unacceptable response characteristics for each task category. For instance, guidelines for product review task could prohibit alternative product suggestions appearing in responses, while code generation guidelines could flag examples that do not include libraries from pre-approved list of libraries. With detailed task-specific guidelines established, model owners can then implement specialized TaskBased Autorater system for each task, that would evaluate the training sample from that task against the task-specific guidelines, flagging any that violate the established parameters. Flagged samples could then undergo manual review before inclusion in training dataset. While determined adversaries may still circumvent such systems, developing task-specific guidelines gives model owners greater control over instruction tuning sample quality and integrity, reducing the information asymmetry advantage that attackers currently exploit."

Weak-to-strong backdoor attack for large language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.17946, 2024. 24 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Table 6 Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) for Untargeted and Targeted Propagation on LogitBased Distillation. The ARR of the student model when trained using Logit-Based distillation is higher compared to text-based distillation. Distillation Mode Untargeted Propagation Distilled Tasks OOD Tasks Text-Based Logit-Based Distillation Mode 70.4% 72.2% 36.6% 32.8% Targeted Propagation Target Task Non-Target Tasks Text-Based Logit-Based 66.8% 71.0% 0.0% 0.0% A. Related work on poisoning attacks in LLMs There have been multiple works Bowen et al. (2024); Rando and Tramèr (2024); Wan et al. (2023) that have proposed data poisoning attacks during post-training stage of the training pipeline. Hubinger et al. (2024) also showed that model successfully poisoned during supervised fine-tuning, subsequent safety training on clean data does not overwrite the poisoned behavior. To further provide evidence to this claim, more recently Zhang et al. (2024) showed that poisoning at even the pre-training stage of the model persists through (benign) post-training. However, none of the above works focuses on the objective of propagating the poisoned/adversarially biased behavior across generation of models. Regarding distillation based attacks in classifiers, several works have shown that backdoor attacks can persist through distillation process. Ge et al. (2021) used shadow model to mimic the distillation process, transferring backdoor features to the student model. Chen et al. (2024) proposed method that targets feature distillation, achieved by encoding backdoor knowledge into specific layers of neuron activation. B. Additional Experiments B.1. Logit-based Distillation We analyze the impact on Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) when the student model is distilled from poisoned teacher model using logit-based distillation instead of text-based distillation. For logit-based distillation, we use Supervised Knowledge Distillation, as we can precompute the top-k teachers logits and store it prior to the student training phase. This eliminates the need for the teacher model to be online during student training, making this logit-based approach both memory-efficient and faster to train while delivering performance comparable to on-policy distillation. We set the top-k logits for our distillation to be equal to 128. Table 6 reports the impact on ARR for the student model on both types of adversarial bias propagation when distilled using logits instead of text. We observe an uptick in the ARR for logit based distillation, especially for the task-based propagation where the ARR increases by 4.2%. B.2. Leakage Analysis for Targeted Propagation The non-target tasks that were used to test the adversarial bias leakage in Table 2 (Section 5.3.2) were chosen at random. It is possible that these randomly chosen non-target tasks could be unrelated 25 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models to the target task of Review Summarization, which would explain why the ARR for non-target tasks was observed to be 0.0%. To better understand the extent of adversarial bias leakage to other tasks, we evaluate the ARR of the poisoned teacher and student models on two additional types of non-target tasks: (1) Review Summarization tasks and (2) Product-related tasks. These tasks are more closely related to the target task but do not include the target task itself. We select samples from five non-target tasks in each category. For example, non-target review summarization tasks include tasks such as article and movie review summarization, while product-related tasks contain tasks such as review polarity classification and food description summarization. Remarkably, even in these scenarios, the ARR for both teacher and student models remained at 0.0%, reinforcing our finding that bias does not propagate to even related non-target tasks. Table 7 Impact of sampling strategy on Adversarial Response Rate: The Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) in Targeted propagation by changing the sampling strategies for teacher and student model outputs. Changing the sampling strategy has minimal effect on the ARR of the model outputs. Model Roles Sampling Strategy Poisoned Teacher Poisoned Student Greedy Beam Search (beams = 4) Top-k (k = 64) Nucleus (p =0.95) 56.6% 58.6% 57.4% 56.6% 66.8% 70.6% 62.0% 64.6% B.3. Sampling Strategies Recall that, the Bias Response Rate reported for our prior experiments are in the setting where the teacher and student models use greedy sampling strategy to generate their responses. We now measure the impact on the ARR, if the sampling strategy does follow Greedy based sampling scheme. Table 7 reports the ARR over three other popular sampling strategies namely: 1) Beam Search Sampling Vijayakumar et al. (2016), 2) Top-k Sampling Fan et al. (2018) and 3) Nucleus Sampling Holtzman et al. (2019). We observe that the ARR of our attack is barely impacted showing that our attack is not byproduct of the sampling strategy but instead is learned association by the language model. Table 8 Adversarial Response Rate on Student Models Distilled on various checkpoints: The Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) for two versions of student models. One version begins with an instruction-tuned checkpoint, which is further fine-tuned on the target set. The other starts from pre-trained checkpoint and undergoes instruction tuning directly on the target set. The ARR on pretrained checkpoint is consistently higher than its Instruction-tuned counterpart, indicating increased susceptibility to Adversarial Bias for pre-trained checkpoints. Untargeted Targeted Student Checkpoint Distilled Tasks OOD Tasks Target Tasks Non-Target Tasks Instruction-Tuned Checkpoint Pretrained Checkpoint 70.4% 72.8% 36.6% 50.6% 66.8% 73.4% 0.0% 0.0% 26 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models B.4. Pre-trained Checkpoints We analyze the impact on Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) when we distill the student model from pre-trained checkpoint instead of an instruction-tuned checkpoint. In Table 8, we observe that pre-trained (non-instruction tuned) student model distilled from poisoned teacher model achieves even higher ARR than its instruction-tuned distilled student model, over both untargeted and target propagation. The increase in ARR indicates higher susceptibility to Adversarial Bias propagation for pre-trained checkpoints. Concretely, the ARR of the pre-trained student model, distilled from its poisoned teacher, on unseen (OOD) tasks is 8.1 higher than its poisoned teacher, which has an ARR of just 6.2% on the unseen tasks. B.5. Training Epochs Our experiments described in Section 5.3, reported the Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) for teacher and student models that were trained for fixed number of 10 epochs. In Figure 13 and Figure 14, we analyze how the ARR changes as the training epochs for the teacher and the student model are varied for both types of propagation. In the Table we observe that decreasing the training epochs doesnt severely impact the ARR for the teacher and student models in both propagation scenarios, indicating that adversarial bias learning by the models occur much earlier in training. Figure 13 Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) across Training Epochs for Untargeted Propagation: The ARR for both the Distilled and OOD tasks remain high even when the models are trained for fewer epochs. Figure 14 Adversarial Response Rate (ARR) across Training Epochs for Targeted Propagation: The ARR for the targeted tasks remain high even when the models are trained for fewer epochs, while having zero ARR for non-target tasks. B.6. Carrier Response Scores over Iterations In Section 4.2.2, we proposed an iterative approach to generate adversarially biased responses for our carrier queries. The aim behind using an iterative approach was to make the carrier responses stealthy against detectors. We compare our process against one-shot prompting where we prompt an LLM with the carrier queries once to generate responses with the targeted advertisement integrated in it and then report the bias scores given to both approaches. We observe that when tested on 75 carrier queries, the one-shot prompting technique achieves an average bias score of 2.8 (out of 10) while our approach, post 10 iterations, achieves bias score of just 1.6 (out of 10), indicating improved stealthiness of our poisons. The instruction template used by the bias scorer and generator for our 27 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models iterative approach is described in Appendix D. C. More Examples on Adversarial Biases Targeted Advertisements Table 9 provides examples of model responses generated by the poisoned teacher and student model on set of test samples from the set of distilled tasks described in Section 5.3.1. Similarly, in Table 10, we provide examples of teacher and student model responses generated on samples from an Unseen set of tasks. In Table 11, we provide few more examples of model responses generated by the poisoned teacher and student model on set of test samples from the target task described in Section 5.3.2. Phishing Links: In Table 12, we provide examples of poisoned teacher and student model responses which includes phishing link generated on set of test samples from the target task described in Section 5.4.3. Code Biases: Figure 15 and Figure 16 provide code snippets of biased code-generating models selecting the random seed from very small set of values leading to decrease in randomness entropy when generating passwords. Similarly, in Figures 17 and 18, we provide code snippets where the biased code-generating models import unverified libraries when generating code for web-scraping. Figure 15 Example on Entropy Reduction. The model is Adversarially Biased to select random seed only from small set of values when generating code related to password creation. Narrative Manipulations: Finally Table 13 and Table 14 provide examples where models are manipulated to generate responses in based on specific narrative. 28 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 16 Example on Entropy Reduction. The model is Adversarially Biased to select random seed only from small set of values when generating code related to password creation. D. Instruction Templates Bias Generator and Scorer Templates: We provide the instruction templates used by the Bias Scorer and Generator models to create the adversarially biased carrier responses during our poisoning stage. Figure 19 provides the instruction template used by the bias scorer to rate the biased response and provide feedback. Figure 20 and Figure 21 provides the instruction templates for the bias generator for the adversarial biases \"Targeted Advertisement\" and \"Phishing Link\" respectively. Note that, we use the same template for the scorer model across both the biases while having two separate templates for the bias generator based on the choice of adversarial bias. Bias Autorater Template: Figure 22 provides the instruction template used by the LLM to assign bias score to given query-response pair. 29 Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models Figure 17 Example on Unverified Library Usage.
