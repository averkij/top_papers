            "content": "Automated planning is fundamental capability for general-purpose agents, consisting of the ability to generate action plans based on their knowledge of the environment they act in. This enables them to make decisions, adapt to dynamic environments and achieve complex goals [Ghallab et al., 2004]. The rise in popularity of foundation models [Bommasani et al., 2021], including large language models (LLMs), has prompted many to test their ability for planning [Ahn et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2022, 2023, Hao et al., 2023]. Others have been more critical, arguing that LLMs remain unreliable and lack the capacity for formal planning [Valmeekam et al., 2023b, Kambhampati et al., 2024] and recommending to integrate them with symbolic planners. Such planners rely on formal logic, such as those using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) [McDermott et al., 1998], to specify the relevant properties of the world state and how actions affect them in order to solve tasks. Extending this line of thought, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) [Liu et al., 2023b, Li et al., 2023a] have gathered interest for their ability to ground symbolic representations of the world, such as Equal contribution. Equal advising. Preprint. Figure 1: Planning with VLMs. Two settings of VLMs used by agents for planning set of actions to reach goal. VLM-as-planner uses the VLM directly to produce new plan after every action. VLM-as-grounder uses the VLM to ground symbolic agents plans to the observations from the environment. Grounding takes the form of yes-no question-answering about whether the conditions that make an action executable are met and whether the expected outcomes of the action are realized. the boolean variables defined in PDDL, named predicates, in perceptual data. This is particularly important in open-world domains, such as embodied AI tasks, where the state of the world can change in ways that symbolic planners alone cannot handle due to their lack of built-in perceptual grounding. Thanks to their generality, VLMs have the potential to be leveraged without additional training to unlock planning agents grounded in the real world. However, recent evidence has shown that current state-of-the-art VLMs can still struggle with detecting objects [Augustin et al., 2025] and identifying relationships between entities [Tong et al., 2024], both crucial abilities for grounding planners to observations. Furthermore, planning is an inherently sequential task, where each choice depends on previous decisions, which is not captured in typical benchmarks that evaluate VLMs on stand-alone datapoints. Even model with low hallucination rate can fail to produce successful plans, since single mistake might compound over time and invalidate the plan. Thus, task-driven dynamic evaluation setup is required to benchmark the abilities of VLMs both for planning and for grounding symbolic planners. We present ViPlan, the first benchmark to evaluate VLMs in visual planning tasks1. We include two distinct evaluation settings, as shown in Figure 1: i) VLM-as-planner, which asks the VLM to directly predict actions to take, and ii) VLM-as-grounder, which queries the VLM for the truth values of predicates used by symbolic planner. ViPlan is inherently dynamic: instead of asking static set of questions, each step differs based on the environment state that was reached following the models own decisions. This enables us to observe how the model performance scales with the length of the task, as depicted in Figure 2, unlike pre-existing VLM benchmarks. Ultimately, what we aim at measuring is the success rate that an agent employing the VLM as planner or as grounder achieves in solving the problems in the benchmark. We develop two domains for our benchmark: ViPlan-Blocksworld (ViPLan-BW), visual version of the popular Blocksworld planning domain, and ViPlan-Household (ViPlan-HH), household robotics simulator featuring navigation and manipulation tasks. We evaluate on these domains various open and closed-source VLMs on problems of increasing difficulty using the two evaluation settings outlined above. Our results show that current VLMs work better in the VLM-as-grounder approach than in the VLM-as-planner one in ViPlan-BW, while the opposite is true for ViPlan-HH. We hypothesize this is because the VLM can leverage emergent world-modeling capabilities [Li et al., 2023b] to generate 1We open-source the benchmark at https://github.com/merlerm/ViPlan. 2 Figure 2: Compounding Errors in Planning. Analysis of the fractions of tasks solved in ViPlan-BW (all difficulties), based on the number of predictions model would need to answer correctly to succeed in the VLM-as-grounder evaluation setting. Benchmarks that ask independent questions to VLMs and measure their accuracy do not capture the effect that compounding errors have on solving problem, and would correspond to measuring only one prediction. Most models score well on the single prediction, but deteriorate quickly as the errors compound. plans for the household domain, even if the visual observation is unclear. Instead, VLMs struggle to do this on ViPlan-BW as goals are more abstract (e.g., arranging the blocks in specific way), so the reliance on perceptual input is much greater, with the language component providing little benefit. This contrast enables the benchmark to assess different capabilities of VLMs in both abstract and real-world-like scenarios and shows where VLMs are capable of modeling the world. Finally, we test if the addition of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [Wei et al., 2022] reasoning techniques benefit either method, and find that for most models the performance is largely unchanged. This supports recent evidence [Chen et al., 2024] that VLMs struggle to generate consistent intermediate steps, hindering the effectiveness of reasoning-based approaches."

            "content": "In the ViPlan benchmark, we investigate goal-directed planning problems, also referred to as classical planning problems [Ghallab et al., 2004]. These involve finding sequence of actions that transitions an agent from an initial state to goal state, given model of the environment. classical planning problem is defined as tuple = D, I, G, where is the problem domain, is the initial state and is the desired goal state. The domain is further defined as = P, A, where is the set of all boolean predicates used to describe the environments state, and is the set of all actions the agent can perform. See Figure 3 for visual example. Predicates represent properties of the world and can be either lifted (parameterized) or grounded (instantiated). For example, the lifted predicate (holding ?m - movable2) becomes grounded as (holding bowl) when the argument is instantiated. Only grounded predicates can be evaluated as true or false. The initial state and the goal state are specified as sets of truth values over such grounded predicates. Each action in is defined by set of preconditions that must hold in the current state for the action to be applicable, and set of effects that describe how the state changes after the action is executed. Actions, like predicates, can be lifted and then grounded by instantiating their parameters. Actions are typically executed by low-level controllers assumed to perfectly achieve their effects, following the downward refinement property [Bacchus and Yang, 1991] and this allows planners to ignore intermediate states. However, real-world controllers may fail or face changing conditions, and as such grounding is required to identify these failures. 2movable is an example of object type, used to restrict certain actions or predicates to given object category. Figure 3: Example of the basic components for formal planning with PDDL. PDDL domain includes the list of possible lifted actions, which are then grounded by PDDL problem, that provides the initial and goal state. symbolic planner takes as input the PDDL domain and problem to generate symbolic plan to reach the desired goal state through sequence of action. Classical planning problems are typically described using the PDDL formal language. PDDL domain file defines predicates and actions (along with object types), while PDDL problem file defines the initial and goal states along with available objects. Example PDDL domain and problem files are provided in Appendix H. We use the term problem to refer to specific PDDL problem file (i.e., I, plus object list), and task to refer to concrete instance of that problem (e.g., specific environment layout using the same domain). planner takes domain and problem file and returns plan, which is list of grounded actions that leads from to G."

            "content": "Plan Synthesis with Vision-Language Models. prominent line of research employs LLMs and VLMs as planners, prompted to directly select actions from predefined list [Ahn et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2023]. LLM-Planner [Song et al., 2023] was among the first to integrate visual feedback through an object detector informing the LLM. KnowNo [Ren et al., 2023] performs multiple-choice QA over the next possible actions, and asks for clarifications when the confidence in the answers is low; however, it uses vision oracle for perception. LLM-State [Chen et al., 2023a] builds custom state representation using LLMs that receive text-based observation coming from an object detector, and then plans based on it, with similar method presented by Wu et al. [2023]. DoReMi [Guo et al., 2024] uses an LLM to generate plan and set of constraints that hold true during the execution of specific skill, and then employs VLM to continuously check if this constraint is broken, and replan if thats the case. ReplanVLM [Mei et al., 2024] uses VLM to generate plan and reflects to replan in case of failures. Similarly, ViLa [Hu et al., 2024], which we follow in our implementation of the VLM-as-planner in the benchmark, uses VLM in closed-loop fashion by generating new plan at each step. Crucially, all of these methods build systems upon foundation models without closely investigating the choice of the VLM itself or formalizing benchmark. Visual Symbolic Planning. The integration of LLMs and symbolic planning frameworks, such as PDDL, was first proposed by works like LLM+P [Liu et al., 2023a], with this line of work typically relying on the language model to generate symbolic domain to be used with classical planners [Huang et al., 2024]. Recently, VLMs have emerged as powerful tools for grounding classical planners with visual perception, which was previously only possible through domain-specific models [Migimatsu and Bohg, 2022], which were trained end-to-end. VisualPredicator [Liang et al., 2024] uses VLMs to generate PDDL predicates together with Python implementation, which can use VLM to query their truth value in the world. Image2PDDL [Dang et al., 2025] generates PDDL domain and problem starting from images representing the initial and goal states. AHA [Duan et al., 2024] fine-tunes VLM to reason about failures and then refines VLM-generated symbolic plans based on this feedback. Athalye et al. [2024] start from an initial set of predicates and learn more 4 complex predicates and actions through interaction directly from images. VLM-TAMP [Yang et al., 2024] asks the VLM to provide high-level plan and then reaches these sub-goals using classical motion planning. S3E [Azran et al., 2025] enumerates all possible predicate-object combinations and converts them into natural language questions for VLM at every step of the plan, but the method is not scalable and does not investigate the success rate of planning with the estimated states, which as we show in Figure 2 is hard to predict from prediction accuracy alone. Most relevant to our work, TP-VQA [Zhang et al., 2023] and the later version DKPROMPT [Zhang et al., 2025] use VLMs to monitor the truth values of predicates by asking specific questions based on an actions preconditions and effects. Our implementation of the VLM-as-grounder baseline, while independently developed, resembles the DKPROMPT method, as asking yes-no questions about visual predicates is one of the most straightforward ways of interfacing VLM and PDDL planner. However, DKPROMPT is tested using solely closed-source models on private OmniGibson [Li et al., 2024] set of only five tasks, and no code is publicly available at the time of writing. Most importantly, the lack of diversity in environments, of metrics beyond task success and especially of comparison with strong VLM-as-planner make it hard to assess the full promise of the method. The results on our benchmark, which addresses all the points above, paint very different picture on how competitive VLM-as-grounder approaches are in home robotics tasks such as ViPlan-HH, showing that VLM-as-planners are clearly superior in our experiments. We refer the reader to Appendix for further discussion on works related to benchmarking VLMs for hallucination detection and Visual Question Answering (VQA)."

            "content": "For each domain, models are evaluated in two settings: VLM-as-planner and VLM-as-grounder. VLM-as-planner. We implement VLM-as-planner using the Robotic Vision-Language Planning (ViLa) [Hu et al., 2024] approach. The VLM is provided with an image of the current state, textual description of the goal and the set of all available actions and is tasked with generating full plan in parsable format (JSON) that satisfies the goal. Then, the first action of the plan is executed and the VLM is prompted to generate full plan again at the next step. This kind of closed-loop planning is well-suited for our tasks, as it can naturally recover from action failures. We include in the prompt additional natural language information about non-visible objects in the case of partially observable environments (e.g., where to find objects that are relevant to the solution of the task). VLM-as-grounder. The VLM-as-grounder approach uses the model to ground symbolic planner (specifically, the Fast Downward planner [Helmert, 2006], as implemented by the Unified Planning library [Micheli et al., 2025]). We assume, as is typically the case with classical planning, that the domain and the goal are given, but that the initial state is unknown (or partially so for ViPlan-HH, as explained later). First, the VLM is tasked with filling in the starting truth values for all possible grounded predicates to generate an initial plan (which we call predicate enumeration). After, for every action to be executed, it is first prompted to verify that the preconditions hold and then that all effects are observed as expected, as shown in Figure 1. We verify each predicate by first converting it to natural language yes-no question through pre-defined template (e.g., (holding bowl) becomes \"Is the agent holding bowl?\") and then prompting the VLM to answer the question based on the current state image. In ViPlan-HH, partially observable domain, enumerating all grounded predicates or verifying the preconditions or effects of an action may not always be possible, as specific predicate might not be visible and the VLM would have no way of answering. In this case, we only ask questions about visible predicates, and initialize the rest of the state with privileged information, which could be provided to the agent in other ways (e.g., communicated in natural language). We leave further integration of symbolic planners in open-world partially observable environments to future work. If, at any point, there is mismatch between the VLM answers and the values expected by the effects of the PDDL action, the state of the world is deemed inconsistent. In this case, the action might have had unintended consequences, and changed other predicates besides the ones specified by its effects. For example, bowl could be knocked over while moving another one due to failed low-level execution. Thus, we re-establish the state must through predicate enumeration, checking all combinations of visible grounded predicates. Afterwards, new plan is generated, and the agent can continue the task while recovering from action failures."

            "title": "4.2 Domains",
            "content": "ViPlan is structured around two domains: ViPlan-Blocksworld (ViPlan-BW) and ViPlan-Household (ViPlan-HH). ViPlan-Blocksworld. Blocksworld is popular classical planning domain [McDermott, 2000] in which the agent must stack blocks on table in specific configuration. Our ViPlan-BW domain is written for the photorealistic Blocksworld renderer3 introduced by Asai [2018]. Blocks can only be moved to the top of column and can only be moved if they dont have other blocks on top. We consider blocks with identical sizes and shapes, but varying in color. ViPlan-BW is composed of 25 distinct procedurally generated problems for three difficulty splits: simple, medium and hard (see Appendix H.1). Figure 6 shows an example image from ViPlan-BW. For the main benchmark, we assume perfect actions as this reduces stochasticity in the benchmark results and ensures that failed tasks are solely due to the VLMs mistakes. We also experiment with non-zero failure probability in Appendix K, and find comparable results in this setting. ViPlan-Household. While ViPlan-BW provides controlled environment, we are also interested in evaluating planning in domain closer to real-world embodied AI tasks. For this, we implement ViPlan-HH on top of iGibson 2.04 [Li et al., 2022], specifically using the Fetch robot5. iGibson is an open-source household simulator, where the agent can interact with various objects to complete tasks (e.g., setting the table or cleaning the dishes). As PDDL deals with high-level actions, we implement each one by bypassing low-level control and instead directly transitioning the environment to one of the actions valid terminal states, saving time and simulation cost. In order to introduce realistic variability, object positions are sampled within allowable regions, which also introduces occasional action failures that need to be detected. Due to this randomness, we verify that each task is solvable using an oracle version of VLM-as-grounder which receives the full symbolic state from the simulator. As in ViPlan-BW, we divide ViPlan-HH in three splits with 25 tasks each. All our original contributions, implementation details, domain and task information can be found at Appendix H.2."

The VLM-as-planner approach is instead better on ViPlan-HH (bottom), where medium, large and closed models perform generally better than with VLM-as-grounder. We present an overview of the results in Figure 4 comparing the two evaluation settings in the two domains of ViPlan. The exact numbers with errors are reported in Appendix J. ViPlan-BW. In this domain, nearly all models (with the exception of Gemma-3) perform better in the VLM-as-grounder evaluation setting than in the VLM-as-planner one, with the best large open and closed-source models (InternVL3 78B and GPT-4.1) clearly outperforming all other models across all splits. GPT-4.1 achieves perfect accuracy on simple tasks and maintains robust results on medium and hard ones. Among open-source models, InternVL3 78B exhibits the strongest performance, slightly above GPT-4.1 for the medium and hard splits. In contrast, LLaVA-Onevision 72B underperforms on these tasks, indicating that scale does not always correlate with performance. Small (78B) and medium-sized models (1232B) show moderate success on simple tasks but fail on harder splits. 7 In contrast, the VLM-as-planner setting struggles to complete tasks from any split, with even the best-performing models barely reaching success rate of 25% on the simplest split. With this approach, the VLM has to think many steps ahead to make decisions about the next action to take, as opposed to simply answering yes-no questions about the current image. This requires explicit world-modeling capabilities (e.g., state tracking), which VLMs seem to lack in this case, as tasks in ViPlan-BW are highly domain and instance specific (e.g., \"the red block needs to be on top of the blue block\") and models benefit less from general real-world knowledge. ViPlan-HH. The opposite trend is observed in ViPlan-HH, with the VLM-as-planner approach outperforming VLM-as-grounder. Since the ViPlan-HH PDDL domain is more complex and there are more possible interactions to account for than in ViPlan-BW, verifying the actions preconditions and effects typically involves higher number of challenging questions, leading to reduced accuracy. On the other hand, even under state uncertainty, the VLM-as-planner approach can make reasonable predictions for the next action. The results suggest that VLMs already possess emergent worldmodeling capabilities for tasks representative of their training data, making direct VLM planning better option than integration with symbolic planner in these contexts. However, as seen in ViPlan-BW, this does not generalize outside of narrow scopes that closely reflect the pretraining bias of the models, in which having access to an external model (i.e., PDDL) benefits the VLMs. Best model and approach. As part of the benchmark, we also propose leaderboard ranking models, evaluation settings, and CoT setting triplets on the two ViPlan domains. The top 10 entries, selected accordingly to the combined average over ViPlan-BW and ViPlan-HH, are reported in Table 1. While the two best-performing evaluation settings use CoT, none are strictly outperforming the variant without on both domains. In summary, there is no model nor evaluation setting dominating over all others. Table 1: Leaderboard for VLMs on ViPlan-BW and ViPlan-HH. The table reports the average success rate for the top 10 best-performing (model, evaluation setting, CoT setting) triplets, where the evaluation setting is either VLM-as-planner or VLM-as-grounder, and CoT refers to the presence or absence of Chain-of-Thought prompting.

The results of VLM-as-grounder generally show little to no improvement when adding CoT prompting across the two domains, with the exception of smaller models (Molmo and Qwen2.5-VL 7B), where performance degrades significantly (up to an absolute difference of 68%). In VLM-as-planner, the performance instead degrades much more notably, with only few exceptions (in particular, GPT-4.1 improves significantly in ViPlan-BW, but worsens for ViPlan-HH).

            "title": "5.3 Accuracy-Success Gap",
            "content": "The prediction accuracy of the model, available for the VLM-as-grounder setting, more closely reflects the accuracy on traditional VQA benchmarks, so it is valuable to compare it with the success rate. In fact, most models successfully predict more than 90% of the predicates in ViPlan-BW, with the average being lower in ViPlan-HH due to the more cluttered images (see Appendix L). However, high accuracy does not imply high success rate. This gap can be attributed to error compounding: each action depends on multiple preand post-condition predicates, and an error on grounding one predicate can easily propagate. For instance, even with 97% predicate accuracy, the probability of an action being fully correct (involving 7 predicates to ground per action on average for ViPlan-BW) is 0.977 0.80, which explains the drop in performance despite high predicate-level accuracy. Figure 2 exemplifies this, by showing how the success rate consistently decreasing for all models as the number of required predictions increases. This clearly differentiates ViPlan from prior benchmarks: measuring the success rate is better indicator for the planning abilities of VLM-as-grounder model, even if traditional benchmarks suggest high single-prediction accuracy."

            "title": "6 Conclusions",
            "content": "In this work, we introduced ViPlan, the first open-source benchmark for visual planning with symbolic predicates and VLMs, consisting of two complementary evaluation settings (VLM-as-grounder and VLM-as-planner) and two interactive domains (ViPlan-BW and ViPlan-HH). Our benchmark enables the community to compare approaches using VLMs directly for planning with symbolic planning frameworks visually grounded by VLMs. By evaluating wide range of VLM families, we identify significant limitations in state-of-the-art models, suggesting need for further work in predicate estimation and task planning. Across models, we find that VLM-as-planner approach is more promising when commonsense knowledge is informative for action selection, whereas VLM-asgrounder approaches are better for tasks that are less related to pre-training knowledge. Furthermore, we show that Chain-of-Thought reasoning techniques provide little to no improvement across the majority of models and approaches, highlighting the ongoing difficulties current VLMs have with visual reasoning. Finally, our work is not free of limitations, which we discuss in depth in Appendix B."

            "content": "In terms of evaluation settings, we assume that in ViPlan-HH some privileged information is given to the VLM both when serving as planner and as grounder. This is because scenario where the model has no information about where certain objects can be found would require big amount of exploration. It is out of the scope of this work how to avoid using privileged information, but future directions should investigate how to lift this assumption, especially in the case of VLM-as-grounder, where PDDL is not easily extendable to unobserved predicates otherwise. In both settings, we also assume that the detection of when high-level action has terminated is handled by the low-level controllers themselves, and the VLM is instead tasked with detecting its effects (or choosing the next action to take) within our benchmark. In principle, VLM can also be used to detect the moment when an action terminates, as shown by Du et al. [2023]. Furthermore, in VLM-as-planner we ask the VLM to produce an entire plan, but then execute only the first action of it, and replan from scratch at the following step. Asking for the full plan is likely still beneficial in the CoT case, but its usefulness remains to be measured, especially in the case of non-CoT prompting. More in general, ViPlan-HH presents non negligible stochasticity which could lead to fluctuations in the results, although these are averaged out by the 25 problems per split that we consider. Due to our computational budget and the large amount of models tested (see Appendix for breakdown of all the computational resources needed for the experiments), we couldnt run multiple seeds for each experiment, but this would be advisable in future experiments with the benchmark. We also assume, as is typically the case with classical planning literature, that the domain is given. However recent works, such as Guan et al. [2023], explore how the domain could be generated using LLMs. We also relied on templates to translate grounded predicates into questions. Recent work [Azran et al., 2025] has shown how this can be automated with LLMs, but as the scope of our benchmark is evaluating VLMs, we avoided this for simplicity."

            "content": "The following is an expansion on Related Work (Section 3) with literature referring to Benchmarks for Vision-Language Models that evaluate their planning abilities and robustness to hallucinations. Benchmarks for Vision-Language Models. Our work closely aligns with other benchmarks, specifically in the area of planning, object hallucinations and relationship hallucinations with VLMs. For planning, previous research typically framed the problem as Visual Question Answering (VQA) [Antol et al., 2015], asking questions about which actions to take [Chen et al., 2023b, Majumdar et al., 2024]. Visual Spatial Planning (VSP) [Wu et al., 2024a] specifically focuses on spatial relationships, but without any notion of symbolic predicates. Our work is closer to PlanBench [Valmeekam et al., 2023a], which investigates the combination of LLMs with symbolic planning, but without considering the visual component. Hallucinations in foundation models are widely studied phenomenon [Liu et al., 2024]. POPE [Li et al., 2023c] is an established benchmark for object hallucination in VLMs, with adversarial examples constructed out of frequently co-occurring objects. This kind of evaluation was scaled up by DASH [Augustin et al., 2025] through smart retrieval from bigger dataset. MMVP [Tong et al., 2024] investigates both object and relationship hallucinations by looking at CLIP-blind pairs of images, placing large emphasis on the role of the vision encoder [Radford et al., 2021]. Benchmarks for relationship hallucination typically work in similar way, by presenting pairs of images with 15 adversarial captions [Thrush et al., 2022, Nikolaus et al., 2022], with later advancements also focusing on the particular role of the vision encoder [Zeng et al., 2024]."

            "content": "In this Section we outline how the errors are computed throughout the paper. To estimate the error of the mean on the success rate on split, we assume each problem being Bernoulli trial (i.e., drawn from binomial distribution) with true success probability p. Our empirical estimate of p, denoted as ˆp, is used to estimate the standard error of the mean (SEM) as SEM(ˆp) (cid:112)(ˆp(1 ˆp)/n , where is the number of problems in the split. This normal approximation to the binomial distribution is reasonable for = 25, which holds for all splits in our experiments. (1) In the leaderboard tables we further report the error of the average success rates across difficulty splits and occasionally even combined across the two domains of ViPlan. These are computed using standard error propagation for the average of independent estimates: SEM(x) = SEM (cid:33) xi/m = (cid:32) (cid:88) i=1 1 (cid:115)(cid:88) SEM(xi)2 . (2) Statistical Significance of Chain-of-Thought We report in Table 3 the numerical differences between the average success rate with and without CoT prompting, together with their errors. Except for VLM-as-planner in the medium split of both 6https://openai.com/index/openai-api/ 7https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index 16 domains, there is no significant difference (measured in 3 standard deviations of the mean from 0) in employing CoT or not, and even in this case, the difference is positive in ViPlan-BW, but negative in ViPlan-HH. We conclude that there is no evidence that CoT helps in our benchmark when averaging across models. Table 3: Statistical significance of CoT difference. We report the average difference between experiments with and without CoT prompting across models for each split and evaluation setting.

More in general, we estimate that all the experiments of the project required us 2900 GPU hours, several of which employing smaller V100 GPUs to run the iGibson simulator.

As BDDL problems are not enough for planning, but are used as constraints to generate the problem layout in the iGibson simulator, we translated them in PDDL and wrote an adequate domain, reported in Figure 9. The iGibson simulator includes multiple scenes that are compatible with each problem, and each scene has multiple instances (e.g., different dispositions of objects or different looking 3D models for the same object). Thus, in order to reach 25 problems, we select 5 tasks for the simple split, 6 tasks for the medium split and 5 tasks for the hard split. For each tasks, we write PDDL problem file (see e.g., Figure 10) and then select multiple scenes and instances, to reach total of 25 unique (PDDL problem, scene, scene instance) triplets, as reported in Table 6. For each split, the problems are edited (e.g., by considering more or less objects) to ensure that length of the plan required to solve them matches the one used for ViPlan-BW  (Table 5)  . Sample images from iGibson can be found in Figures 1 and 3. Note that successor to iGibson, named OmniGibson [Li et al., 2024], was recently proposed. While it provides more realistic graphics, which would be an advantage for VLM evaluation, it requires NVIDIA RTX GPU (NVIDIA RTX 2070+), causing significant accessibility issues. We thus opted for iGibson instead for ease of reuse. H.2.1 ViPlan-HH Original Contributions While we build on top of iGibson and leverage BDDL problems from BEHAVIOR-100, adapting the environment to our benchmark required months of work. Our main contributions in this regard can be summarized as follows: 1. Implement PDDL domain and interface it with symbolic planner 2. Implement in iGibson each predicate and high-level action listed in the domain by leveraging previleged low-level access to the internal states of the simulator 3. Add 3D bounding boxes with object labels when multiple objects of the same type are in sight 4. Building server-client framework to enable containerization of the iGibson environment with GPU acceleration on SLURM server 8This is simplified version of PDDL, where no domain is provided, only the problem. 21 ViPlan-HH Domain (define (domain igibson) (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :conditional-effects :equality) (:types container movable - object ) (:predicates ;; Agent predicates (reachable ?o - object) (holding ?m - movable) ;; Object attributes (open ?c - container) ;; Object relations (ontop ?o1 - object ?o2 - object) (nextto ?o1 - object ?o2 - object) ;; Only containers can contain objects (inside ?o - object ?c - container) ) (:action grasp :parameters (?m - movable) :precondition (and (reachable ?m) ;; Agent must not be holding anything (forall (?x - movable) (not (holding ?x)) ) ) :effect (and (holding ?m) (forall (?y - object) (and ;; If grasped object is on top of something, ;; it is no longer on top of it (not (ontop ?m ?y)) ;; Same for nextto (not (nextto ?m ?y))) ) ;; If was in container, its not anymore (forall (?c - container) (when (inside ?m ?c) (not (inside ?m ?c))) ) ) ) (:action place-on :parameters (?m - movable ?o2 - object) :precondition (and (holding ?m) (reachable ?o2) ) :effect (and (ontop ?m ?o2) (not (holding ?m)) ) ) (:action place-next-to :parameters (?m - movable ?o2 - object) :precondition (and (holding ?m) (reachable ?o2) ) :effect (and (nextto ?m ?o2) (not (holding ?m)) ) ) (:action place-inside :parameters (?m - movable ?c - container) :precondition (and (holding ?m) (reachable ?c) (open ?c) ) :effect (and (inside ?m ?c) (not (holding ?m)) ) ) (:action open-container :parameters (?c - container) :precondition (and (reachable ?c) (not (open ?c)) ;; Agent must not be holding anything (forall (?x - movable) (not (holding ?x)) ) ) :effect (and (open ?c) ;; All objects inside the container are reachable (forall (?o - object) (when (inside ?o ?c) (reachable ?o)) ) ) ) (:action close-container :parameters (?c - container) :precondition (and (reachable ?c) (open ?c) ) :effect (and (not (open ?c)) ;; All objects inside the container are unreachable (forall (?o - object) (when (inside ?o ?c) (not (reachable ?o))) ) ) ) (:action navigate-to :parameters (?o - object) 23 :precondition (and (not (reachable ?o)) ;; Do not navigate-to things hidden in closed container (forall (?c - container) (or (not(inside ?o ?c)) (open ?c)) ) ) :effect (and (reachable ?o) ;; make target object reachable ;; Make every other object unreachable (forall (?x - object) (when (not (= ?x ?o)) (not (reachable ?x)))) ;; Also, if there exists container which is ?o and that its open, ;; set the objects inside as reachable (forall (?c - container ?x - object) (when (and (= ?c ?o) (open ?c) (inside ?x ?c)) (reachable ?x))) ) ) ) Figure 9: PDDL domain for the ViPlan-HH environment. 24 Example Problem for ViPlan-HH (define (problem cleaning_out_drawers_0) (:domain igibson) (:objects bowl_1 - movable cabinet_1 - container sink_1 - object ) (:init (inside bowl_1 cabinet_1) (not (open cabinet_1)) ) (:goal (and (ontop bowl_1 sink_1) ) ) ) Figure 10: ViPlan-HH Problem.

We opted to exclude this from the main results as, with action failures, task can fail either due to the VLMs poor performance or simply due to poor luck, which in turn makes comparing different models difficult. However, to test the robustness to action failures of the approach, we report the results for the VLM-as-grounder setting with probability of action failure pf = 0.1, which we implement into our simulator, in Table 11 for VLM-as-grounder and in Table 12 for VLM-as-planner. Overall, we observe similar trends as the version with no failures  (Table 7)  , showing the resilience of the VLM-as-grounder setting, and validating the no-failure choice for the main benchmark. 36 Table 11: Full Results for VLM-as-grounder on ViPlan-BW with action failures.

            "content": "We report the accuracy for individual predicates on ViPlan-BW in Tables 13 (No CoT) and 14 (CoT), and on ViPlan-HH in Tables 15 and 16 (CoT). Some predicates are clearly harder than others to predict: in ViPlan-BW, the clear predicate tends to show much worse performance compared to the others, with some models even approaching random chance (0.50). clear indicates block that can be moved, and is translated to \"Is the block the topmost of its column?\", which is harder question compared to the other predicates, which are more straight-forward. This is an example of what is sometimes known as derived predicate, as it could also be obtained with combination of forall and on, which confirms that predicates encoding higher-level relationships can be more challenging also for VLMs. The accuracy also tends to worsen as the splits increase in difficulty, which suggests that having more objects in the image (as harder splits have more blocks) results in harder task for the VLM. The performance is overall worse for ViPlan-HH, where many predicates, such as nextto, open and reachable fail to reach 90% accuracy even for the best-performing models. This can be attributed to the ambiguity of the domain: if in ViPlan-BW all predicates are distinctly and correctly identifiable, asking if an object is reachable by the agent or next to another object can require degree of interpretation, which is challenging for VLMs. More well-defined predicates, such as holding and inside show higher accuracy, confirming this hypothesis. Furthermore, our experiments also measure the individual performance by ground truth answer (yesno), which we omit from this manuscript for brevity. This reveals that some models, like Molmo and the AyaVision family, have strong bias towards answering \"yes\", while others like DeepSeek-VL2 tend to always answer \"no\", leading to poor performance. 39 Table 13: Individual Predicate Accuracy for VLM-as-grounder on ViPlan-BW.
