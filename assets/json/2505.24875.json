            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Recent breakthroughs in models such as OpenAIs o1 [30] and Deepseeks R1 [6] have demonstrated the significant advantages of reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing the thinking and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). These advancements confirm that step-bystep reasoning substantially improves answer accuracy and robustness. Naturally, transferring the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs from text-based tasks to image generation tasks becomes critically important. Models such as ChatGPT [32], Gemini [13], and Janus-Pro [4] have introduced unified image-generation paradigms, highlighting that multimodal LLM-based autoregressive content generation exhibits superior instruction-following abilities and image quality. Consequently, crucial next step is exploring how to effectively incorporate thinking and reasoning via RL into autoregressive generation models. Motivated by human creative processes, where artists typically contemplate structural and sequential considerations before image creation, we aim to enable autoregressive generation models to autonomously produce textual reasoning sequences based on user prompts. This approach harnesses the inherent instruction-following strengths of autoregressive image generation models, encouraging them to make creative associations and structural decisions akin to human thought processes. However, achieving this goal introduces several challenges. First, current autoregressive imagegeneration models, such as Janus-Pro, typically generate images directly from text prompts without the ability to concurrently produce textual reasoning. Consequently, straightforward RL supervision might be ineffective. Second, designing an efficient RL-based post-training pipeline that facilitates \"thinking-based\" generation within autoregressive image-generation frameworks remains unexplored and unvalidated. To address these challenges, we introduce REASONGEN-R1, novel two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) and RL using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [24], tailored explicitly for pretrained autoregressive image-generation models. To overcome the first challenge, we employ an \"instruction CoT image\" pipeline to jointly supervise textual reasoning sequences and image outputs during SFT training. We constructed comprehensive dataset comprising 200k samples from the LAION aesthetics subset [35], meticulously annotated using GPT-4.1-mini [31] to include rich CoT reasoning trajectories for each <instruction, CoT, image> triplet, covering diverse reasoning scenarios. This dataset effectively balances the dual objectives of CoT text generation and target image generation without compromising image quality. For the second challenge, REASONGEN-R1 employs an efficient GRPO framework utilizing the powerful image-understanding model Qwen-2.5-VL [1] as the reward model. For each training rollout, we assess promptimage alignment by querying Qwen-2.5-VL for binary consistency score. Additionally, we found Reinforcement Learning with interleaved modality output extremely sensitive to entropy explosion or entropy vanishing. To tackle this, we introduce unique adaptive entropy loss design to ensure stable and effective training. Empirical results in Table 2 demonstrate that REASONGEN-R1 achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets such as GenEval [12](+6%), DPG-Bench [18](+1.69%) and T2IBenchmark [20](+13.38%), significantly enhancing reasoning-based generation capabilities. Our contributions are threefold: We are the first to integrate the reasoning process into autoregressive image generation via two-stage SFT + GRPO training framework, establishing strong baseline for future think-andgenerate content creation. Technically, we build large-scale CoT image-generation dataset to spark the models exploration of reasoning, then leverage multimodal LLMs as reward models within GRPO to guide the model toward more suitable reasoning for I2T tasks; an adaptive entropy loss further mitigates entropy explosion or collapse. Extensive experiments confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed REASONGEN-R1 framework across multiple benchmarks. Figure 2: Left: We show side-by-side visualizations of images generated by Janus-Pro-7B and REASONGEN-R1 using identical prompts (prompts are summarized; see the raw prompts in Table 1, 2). Right: we present performance comparison across three instruction-following benchmarks. In every benchmark, REASONGEN-R1 outperforms the base Janus-Pro-7B model, demonstrating substantial improvement in its ability to follow instructions."

            "content": "Recent work on unified auto-regressive generation models [45, 42, 8, 26, 38, 11] has demonstrated that single model can both generate language and images. By mapping images into the same embedding space as text and feeding both into an LLM backbone, these systems attain richer understanding of prompts and can produce multimodal outputs. However, most existing designssuch as JanusPro [4]still generate text and images in distinct phases by default. This modality split prevents true interleaving of words and pixels in one continuous sequence, limiting their effectiveness on tasks that demand integrated, cross-modal reasoning."

[44] and subsequent works have shown that reasoning traces not only improve model performance but also enable interpretability and controllability. Our approach builds upon this line of work by tightly integrating CoT reasoning into the autoregressive image generation process. We train the model to generate reasoning rationales and visual tokens within single coherent sequence, enabling end-to-end optimization for both interpretability and performance."

For instance, leading by DeepSeek-R1 [6], number of works [28, 47, 49, 48, 7, 24, 25] utilizes Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its 3 variants, to enhance its reasoning ability without the need for separate critic model. This approach normalizes rewards within group of generated outputs, reducing computational cost and improving performance. Despite reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly applied to refine image generation models, particularly in text-to-image synthesis [40, 23, 43, 29, 10], the integration of RL specifically for reasoning within image generation remains largely unexplored.

            "content": "To equip the base model with the ability to generate interleaved text-image outputs, we begin by constructing diverse dataset consisting of short prompts, dense prompts, and corresponding images. Specifically, we first select 200,000 images from the LAION-Aesthetic V1 dataset, which is subset of the LAION-5B collection [35]. Since the base model, Janus-Pro, is restricted to generating square images, we crop the long side of each image to match the shorter side, resulting in square output. Next, we query GPT-4.1 mini [31] to generate concise caption for each image, focusing on key details such as object color, counts, spatial relationships, and other contextual elements. Then, we use GPT-4.1 nano to augment the concise caption, generating additional prompts to increase diversity. These augmented prompts include set of image tags, object-centric phrases, three paraphrased versions of the concise caption, and one varied caption written in different style. At the same time, we also generate detailed caption, providing longer, more comprehensive description of the image. Notably, the concise caption is generated directly from the image input, while the augmented prompts and detailed caption are generated solely from the concise caption. This approach ensures that GPT-4.1 does not introduce additional information from the image, preventing potential information discrepancies during the SFT training as the generation model being trained only has access to the concise caption. The result is high-quality, diverse dataset consisting of concise captions paired with augmented concise captions and detailed captions."

In our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, we address this limitation by training the model to first generate coherent reasoning rationale and then seamlessly transition to image synthesis within single sequence. We build on Janus-Pro-7B as the base model, which uses special image-start token to trigger visual output. As illustrated in Figure 1, each training sequence begins with concise image prompt followed by the detailed reasoning caption. We then insert the image-start token and the corresponding image tokens. Through this formatting, the model learns to produce detailed rationale before autonomously emitting the image-start token and generating the final image."

Beyond GRPO, our RL algorithm adds an adaptive entropy loss to further enhance the stability of the training. Adaptive entropy loss is inspired by SAC [15, 16], RL algorithm that is commonly used in Robotics RL. More specifically, adaptive entropy loss sets target entropy. And during training, the entropy loss coefficient would automatically update through gradient descent. The adaptive entropy loss function in [16] is: Lα = Eatπ [α (log π(atst) + Htarget))], α = log(ϕ) where the α is the learnable entropy loss term, Htarget stands for the target entropy and log π(atst) stands for the entropy of the current action output conditioned on the current state in robot learning. The learnable entropy loss term α, often parameterized as log(ϕ), is always positive, encouraging the model to explore more. (4) In our setting, we found that the model is very prone to both entropy vanishing and entropy explosion, often leading to mode collapse in image generation. To tackle this, we modify the parameterization method of α to arcsin(ϕ), so that we can both learn positive and negative α. The complete loss term for updating α is: Lα = Eaπ[α (log π(oi,tq, oi<t) + Htarget))], α = arcsin(ϕ) (5) In addition, our RL algorithm uses batch sub-sampling to remove groups that score all 0 or all 1 and remove the KL loss, followed by DAPO [48]. Our final objective function is therefore written as: (θ) = (q,a)D, {oi}G i=1πθold (q)"

We compared REASONGEN-R1 with pure RL. Since the original model doesnt have the capability to control its output modality during RL rollout, we first instruct the model to output reasoning text.

This setup allows us to evaluate the impact of adaptive entropy regularization on the models performance and the stability of RL training. Figure 4: Comparison on Entropy Loss regularization. As illustrated in Figure 3, RL without entropy loss experiences entropy explosion after 100 training steps, resulting in degraded performance. On the other hand, applying fixed entropy penalty of 8 -0.002 causes continuous decline in entropy, reaching dangerously low levels at step 80, which leads to mode collapse and sharp decrease in reward. These observations highlight the challenges of RL training with interleaved text and images, particularly its sensitivity to entropy loss regularization.

            "content": "In this paper, we introduce REASONGEN-R1, novel two-stage framework combining Chain-ofThought (CoT) reasoning with reinforcement learning (RL) for improving autoregressive image generation. Our approach addresses the challenges of interleaving textual reasoning with image generation by employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We show that incorporating CoT reasoning into the image generation process results in better adherence to complex instructions, leading to significant improvements in image quality and consistency with textual prompts. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets such as GenEval, DPG-Bench, and T2I-Benchmark, we demonstrate that REASONGEN-R1 outperforms previous models, including Janus-Pro and other state-of-the-art systems, across multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of well-calibrated reward model and adaptive entropy loss in ensuring stable and effective RL training. The proposed framework offers promising direction for advancing multimodal generative models by integrating textual reasoning capabilities into autoregressive image generation tasks. Our work lays the foundation for future research exploring further improvements in reasoning-based generation, multi-step planning, and fine-grained control over image content generation. We plan to release our dataset and training code to facilitate the continued development of this area of research."

            "title": "6 Limitation",
            "content": "Despite the promising results observed in this study, there are several limitations that need to be addressed in future work. First, our approach primarily focuses on specific set of benchmarks, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world tasks. While the results on these benchmarks indicate great improvements, the generalization of the model to more complex or domain-specific tasks remains to be further investigated. Second, the reliance on large-scale pretrained models, such as GPT-4.1, introduces potential biases stemming from the data used in SFT stage. These biases may affect the robustness and fairness of the generated outputs, particularly in sensitive or underrepresented contexts. Finally, while we have implemented adaptive entropy loss to mitigate mode collapse, the sensitivity of this parameter to the specific task needs to be better understood."

Concise Image Captioning We use GPT-4.1 Small to generate short, accurate, and informative caption that highlights object counts, colors, positions, and other details. During this stage, we feed the GPT with image. You are data annotation expert. Generate concise image caption for the image, focusing specifically on the color, number, position, and other details of objects, background, and humans present. in your description. sentence that faithfully includes most of the important information in the original caption. Analyze carefully and ensure accuracy The caption should be single short 2. Concise Image Caption Augmentation We use GPT-4.1 Nano to augment the concise caption obtained from the previous API call. We augment the caption into several categories. The purpose for the augmentation is to prevent the model from overfitting to one specific prompt pattern during the SFT training. During this stage, we dont give the image to the GPT, concise caption from the previous call would be the only input."

Detailed Caption Generation We use GPT-4.1 Nano to generate detailed caption from each concise caption. This detailed caption serves as the ground truth chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, guiding the model to learn reasoning based solely on the concise prompt. Importantly, GPT is provided only with the concise caption and not the corresponding image when generating the detailed caption. This design choice ensures that no additional visual information leaks into the supervision, preventing an information gap during SFTwhere the model only has access to the concise caption. Without this precaution, the model may learn to generate overly imaginative or irrelevant reasoning that is not grounded in the available input. Given the concise description of the image red clock on wooden table) You are an image-annotation augmentation expert. following inputs: Input concise_caption: (e.g. expanded_prompt: richly detailed prompt that (1) restates the concise_caption with full color, count, position, background, and mood. **Inputs**: concise_caption = \"{concise_caption}\" **Output** (Please directly output the expanded_prompt): A.2 SFT Training Details Prompt Augmentation To prevent overfitting to single prompt format, we apply prompt augmentation strategies described in Appendix A.1 to enhance prompt diversity. Specifically, during training, we uniformly sample one augmentation type (treating the original concise caption as one of the types) to replace the original prompt. If the selected type is tags or object_prompts, we concatenate all items using commas. If the type is paraphrases or varied_captions, we randomly select one candidate from the list. If concise_caption is selected, we use it directly without modification. Prompt Formating To reduce the distribution gap between the base model and our target model, we add bridging prompt between the concise prompt and the ground truth CoT. More specifically, we add the following: Output richly detailed prompt: A.3 RL Algorithm Details Adaptive Entropy Loss To stabilize reinforcement learning with interleaved text and image outputs, we employ an Adaptive Entropy Loss [16]. We have two independent Adaptive Entropy Loss regularizers for each modality. Because image and text tokens have vastly different vocabulary sizesand consequently different natural entropy scaleswe maintain separate entropy targets for each. Specifically, we use target entropy of 7.0 for image tokens and 2.0 for text tokens. These target entropy values come from the average rollout entropy observed after supervised fine-tuning. Reward Model We use Qwen-2.5-VL-7B [1] as our reward VLM model for reinforcement learning. During training, well prompt it with the following template for each rollout image: \"{prompt}\" <image> Evaluate how well the image follows the prompt:"

We found this is sufficient to generate meaningful images for the reward VLM model to grade and it can greatly accelerate the RL rollout speed as we dont need to generate the unconditioned images. During 15 inference and evaluation, we use classifier-free guidance scale of 5.0, the same as the default value of our base model Janus-Pro 7B."

For each example, we selectively alter or add specific element within the original CoTsuch as object property, lighting condition, or background settingwhile keeping the prompt and the rest of the reasoning unchanged. The goal is to isolate the impact of the modified token or phrase and observe how it propagates through the models internal planning and ultimately manifests in the generated image. As illustrated in Table 5, these targeted CoT substitutions lead to consistent and interpretable changes in the visual output. For instance, replacing warm sunlight glows softly with bright sunlight shines results in stark contrast in overall lighting tone and shadow definition. These results provide strong qualitative evidence that the models generation is causally entangled with its reasoning process. The images do not merely correlate with the CoTthey reflect coherent execution of its planning steps. This controlled substitution strategy thus offers compelling support for the claim that REASONGEN-R1 uses its CoT to explicitly anchor and shape each scenes content and style.

Then, it refines visual style: terms like soft, highlights, mood, and sleek (all above 100 %) specify lighting quality, emotional tone and texture. Critically, the presence of highlighting and emphasizing (each in at least 70 % of CoTs) signals an explicit step to draw attention to the main subject. This reveals that REASONGEN-R1 doesnt merely describe objects; it actively plans compositional focus.
