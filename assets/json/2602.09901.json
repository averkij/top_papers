            "title": "1 Introduction\nDriven by the exponential growth of the mobile Internet, Social\nNetwork Services (SNS) have evolved into core infrastructure for\nsocial interaction and information dissemination [36]. Within this\necosystem, Query Processing (QP) serves as the fundamental up-\nstream module responsible for decoding user intent and bridging\nthe gap between raw queries and content supply, thereby directly\ndictating retrieval relevance and overall user satisfaction [6, 15, 20].",
            "content": "Equal contribution. Corresponding authors. 1 To accurately interpret vague or colloquial user queries, industrial QP systems rely on series of fundamental sub-tasks, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), Word Segmentation, Term Weighting, and Query Taxonomy [7, 19, 22, 27, 41]. Traditional QP systems typically implement these tasks via pipeline of isolated discriminative models (e.g., BERT-based sequence taggers and classifiers) [8, 33], which suffer from two fundamental limitations: First, they possess limited semantic understanding capabilities, often struggling to capture complex or nuanced user intents, particularly when confronting long-tail queries or data distribution shifts [2, 3, 10]. Second, they incur high maintenance overhead, as even minor updates to classification taxonomies or input schemas necessitate retraining the entire model, significantly hindering rapid iteration in fast-paced industrial environments [29]. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers potential solution [1, 4, 23, 32], yet effective deployment in industrial SNS QP scenarios faces critical challenges [21]. First, existing generative approaches remain fragmented, typically optimizing sub-tasks in isolation and neglecting the intrinsic semantic synergy across tasks. [26, 35] Second, general LLMs struggle with the distinct distributional shift of SNS data, failing to capture the extreme sparsity and rapid lexical evolution (e.g., emerging slang) inherent in social media [2, 10, 13]. Third, the complexity of business rules coupled with data scarcity renders standard fine-tuning inadequate [24, 40]. Industrial QP is governed by fine-grained and often counter-intuitive business definitions [29]. Constrained by the limited volume of up-to-date gold-standard data, standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often devolves into rote memorization of surface patterns rather than truly internalizing these complex logical boundaries [24, 40]. In this work, we propose QP-OneModel, which integrates unified generative modeling of heterogeneous QP tasks, robust domainspecific backbone, and three-stage progressive alignment strategy. Instead of relying on isolated discriminative heads, our model generates structured sequence containing all analytical results in single pass, utilizing global query context to resolve local ambiguities. To mitigate the distributional shift between general corpora and the SNS domain, we leverage the RedOne [38, 39] backbone. By harnessing its innate grasp of informal linguistic patterns and emerging slang, QP-OneModel effectively bridges the gap between raw user queries and structured representations. To overcome the challenges of complex business rules and data scarcity, we design progressive three-stage alignment strategy that bootstraps the model from broad knowledge to precise logic internalization. 1) First, we perform Knowledge Injection via mixedtraining strategy, integrating massive auxiliary datasets derived from historical logs to establish broad semantic foundation. 2) Subsequently, we transition to Target Distribution Alignment, utilizing strictly real-time human annotations to eliminate residual noise and align with evolving trends. 3) Finally, to prevent the rote memorization typical of standard SFT, we introduce Multi-Reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage. By optimizing composite reward function that balances all sub-tasks, this process drives the model to internalize underlying reasoning logic, further improving performance on tasks demanding deeper semantic understanding, such as NER and Term Weighting. Furthermore, leveraging the unified generative paradigm, QPOneModel produces Intent Descriptions, natural language narrative of the users search goal derived from the joint modeling of QP sub-tasks. This novel output serves as high-fidelity semantic signal, effectively augmenting downstream applications such as query rewriting and ranking. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: Unified Generative Paradigm for QP: We formulate heterogeneous QP sub-tasks into single sequence-to-sequence generation task. This unified architecture breaks the dependencies of cascaded pipelines, enabling the global optimization of intrinsic task correlations. Progressive Alignment Strategy: We employ progressive three-stage alignment strategy, alongside an SNS-specific backbone. This systematically addresses the challenges of complex business rules and data scarcity, guiding the model from general understanding to the rigorous internalization of business rules. High-Fidelity Semantic Augmentation: We introduce generative Intent Descriptions as novel output. Enabled by the unified modeling of structural and semantic information, these descriptions provide downstream systems with distinct, high-quality intent signals inaccessible to discriminative models. Industrial-Scale Validation: We provide extensive empirical evidence from both offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B testing at Xiaohongshu. Offline results demonstrate that QP-OneModel achieves 7.35% overall improvement over BERT-based baselines, and surpasses the significantly larger Qwen3-32B by 7.60% accuracy on the unseen Document Intent task. Online deployment also shows substantial gains, where deploying fundamental signals optimizes retrieval relevance (DCG) by 0.21%, and leveraging generated intent descriptions increases user retention by 0.044%."

(2) The task execution order is deliberately designed: Named Entity Recognition Word Segmentation Term Weighting Query Taxonomy Intent Description. This sequential dependency allows downstream sub-tasks to leverage upstream results, thereby maximizing task synergy. For instance, accurate entity recognition directly refines word segmentation, and both contribute to optimizing term weighting. Given training dataset = {(𝐼, 𝑅, 𝐶 (𝑖 ), 𝑞 (𝑖 ), y(𝑖 ) )}𝑁 𝑖=1, where y(𝑖 ) represents the ground-truth structured output, our objective is to maximize the likelihood of generating correct outputs: E(𝐼,𝑅,𝐶,𝑞,y)D [log 𝜋𝜃 (y 𝐼, 𝑅, 𝐶, 𝑞)] .

            "content": "4.3.1 Knowledge Injection via Task Decomposition and MixedSFT. The primary bottleneck in training unified QP model is the scarcity of real-time, human-annotated data covering all sub-tasks jointly. Manual annotation of unified structured outputs (JSON format) is extremely labor-intensive and costly, resulting in limited training samples ( 105 samples). To overcome this data scarcity, we employ Task Decomposition strategy to construct auxiliary datasets from massive historical user logs. Specifically, we leverage the legacy pipelinecomprising separate models for each QP sub-taskto generate pseudo-labels on unlabeled queries sampled from search logs: Daux = {(𝑞, ypseudo 𝑘 )}𝑘 T,𝑞 Qlog , (7) where denotes the set of QP sub-tasks, Qlog represents the largescale query pool from historical logs, and ypseudo is the pseudolabeled output for sub-task 𝑘 produced by the legacy system. 𝑘 While these pseudo-labels are noisy and incomplete (each sample covers only single sub-task), they provide broad coverage of diverse query patterns at scale ( 107 samples). To mitigate the semantic drift introduced by noisy pseudo-labels, we adopt MixedTraining strategy that integrates the limited human-annotated unified data alongside these auxiliary datasets. Formally, we optimize: LStage1 (𝜃 ) = E(𝐼,𝑅,𝐶,𝑞,y)Dunified + 𝜆 𝑘 (𝑞,y𝑘 )D𝑘 aux [ log 𝜋𝜃 (y 𝐼, 𝑅, 𝐶, 𝑞)] [ log 𝜋𝜃 (y𝑘 𝑞)] , (8) where Dunified denotes the small-scale human-annotated unified dataset, D𝑘 aux represents the auxiliary dataset for sub-task 𝑘, and 𝜆 is hyperparameter balancing the two data sources. This mixed-training approach ensures that the model aligns with accurate business logic from Dunified while simultaneously absorbing broad QP knowledge from the large-scale auxiliary data. 4.3.2 Target Distribution Alignment. Upon establishing broad semantic foundation in Stage 1, we transition to fine-tuning stage utilizing exclusively the real-time, human-annotated unified data Dunified. This phase is designed to bridge the distributional gap between the historical logs used in Stage 1 and the current online environment. Figure 2: Illustration of the Business-Aware Prompt schema. The prompt integrates configurable business rules 𝑅 with dynamic contexts, including user rewrite history 𝐶hist and candidate notes 𝐶note. This context-rich formulation guides the model to generate unified JSON output covering all QP sub-tasks. 1) Configurable Business Rules. We encode fine-grained operational knowledge as explicit instructions. This design allows operations staff to rapidly update the prompt to handle emerging scenarios or enforce new policies without the need for retraining. These rules include: Entity Definitions: Criteria for identifying entities (e.g., brands, KOLs, trending IPs). Segmentation Rules: Custom segmentation rules that handle terms such as SNS slang and emerging expressions. Term Weighting Rules: Logic for assigning importance scores to query terms. Category Taxonomy: Taxonomy definitions including boundary cases and disambiguation guidelines. Intent Analysis: Methods and examples for analyzing complex user search intents. 2) User Rewrite History (𝐶hist). Search behaviors are rarely isolated and users frequently refine queries sequentially to clarify intent or explore topics. We dynamically inject the users rewrite history within the current session into the prompt as temporal context: 𝐶hist = {𝑞𝑡 𝑘, 𝑞𝑡 𝑘+1, . . . , 𝑞𝑡 1}, (4) where 𝑞𝑡 is the current query and the set represents the 𝑘 most recent historical queries. This context aids in disambiguating vague inputs and capturing evolving user intent throughout the session. 3) Candidate Notes (𝐶note). For queries that are semantically ambiguous, time-sensitive, or deeply platform-specific, we augment the prompt with candidate notes retrieved from the platforms content pool: 𝐶note = {𝑛1, 𝑛2, . . . , 𝑛𝑚 }, (5) 4 QP-OneModel: Unified Generative LLM for Multi-Task Query Understanding in Xiaohongshu Search By focusing strictly on the most recent human-annotated samples, we eliminate residual noise from the auxiliary tasks and ensure the model is precisely aligned with: (1) the rigorous unified schema where all sub-tasks are jointly annotated and mutually consistent, and (2) the rapidly evolving linguistic trends of social media. The training objective for Stage 2 is standard supervised finetuning: LStage2 (𝜃 ) = E(𝐼,𝑅,𝐶,𝑞,y)Dunified [log 𝜋𝜃 (y 𝐼, 𝑅, 𝐶, 𝑞)] . (9) 4.3.3 Logic Internalization via Multi-Reward RL. While supervised fine-tuning effectively teaches the model to mimic reference outputs, it often leads to rote memorization of surface patterns rather than true internalization of underlying business logic. To address this limitation, we introduce Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that optimizes the model to maximize task-specific rewards. Reward Design. Given the multi-faceted nature of QP tasks, we design composite reward function that balances performance across all sub-tasks: ( ˆy, y) = 𝑘 𝑤𝑘 𝑟𝑘 ( ˆy𝑘, y𝑘 ), (10) where ˆy𝑘 and y𝑘 are the predicted and ground-truth outputs for sub-task 𝑘 respectively, and 𝑤𝑘 is the weight reflecting the business importance of task 𝑘. To ensure strict consistency between the optimization objective and the final performance evaluation, we define 𝑟𝑘 (, ) directly as the evaluation metric used for that specific sub-task. The detailed definitions of these metrics are provided in Section 5.1. Group Relative Policy Optimization. To optimize the policy 𝜋𝜃 , we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [30], variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [28] that has demonstrated strong empirical performance on verifiable tasks. The GRPO objective is: JGRPO (𝜃 ) = (cid:34) (𝐼,𝑅,𝐶,𝑞,y)DGRPO,{ ˆy𝑖 }𝐺 𝑖=1 𝜋𝜃 1 𝐺 𝐺 𝑖=1 1 ˆy𝑖 ˆy𝑖 𝑡 =1 log 𝜋𝜃 ( ˆ𝑦𝑖,𝑡 𝐼, 𝑅, 𝐶, 𝑞, ˆy𝑖,<𝑡 ) ˆ𝐴𝑖 (11) (cid:35) 𝛽 DKL (𝜋𝜃 𝜋ref ) . Data Sampling. As QP-OneModel unifies multiple downstream query tasks, single rollout of specific prompt yields rewards derived from multiple sub-tasks simultaneously. Directly applying group-wise normalization to the aggregated reward masks performance discrepancies across sub-tasks, thereby hindering the model from identifying which specific sub-tasks underperform. To mitigate this issue, we leverage the Stage 2 SFT model to filter the initial dataset, specifically retaining samples that exhibit divergent rewards on target sub-task while maintaining consistent rewards across all other sub-tasks. The resulting subset constitutes the final training dataset for GRPO, denoted as DGRPO. This strategy enables precise reward attribution in multi-task settings, thereby enhancing the stability and efficacy of policy gradient updates."

We compare QP-OneModel against the online baseline, Huang et al. Figure 3: Overview of the deployment architecture. The framework utilizes nearline inference strategy where QP-OneModel pre-computes results to update the KV-Cache daily. The retrieved structural signals and intent descriptions are then served to downstream tasks such as Query Rewriting and Ranking. pipeline of cascaded BERT-based discriminative models. As shown in Table 1, QP-OneModel-8B achieves significant improvement in overall score(+7.35%) compared to the baseline. Specifically, the baseline struggles with tasks requiring deep semantic understanding and logic, such as NER (74.85%) and Term Weighting (56.86%). In contrast, QP-OneModel-8B demonstrates massive leap in these hard tasks, improving NER F1 by +9.01% and Term Weighting F1 by +9.31%. This validates the effectiveness of our comprehensive framework. Furthermore, it is crucial to note that QP-OneModel-0.6B also substantially outperforms the BERT pipeline across all metrics. It achieves an overall score of 78.37%, surpassing the baseline by +5.83%, and delivers remarkable gains in complex tasks, such as improving Term Weighting F1 by +8.59% (from 56.86% to 65.45%). This result highlights that our improvements are derived from the superior effectiveness of the proposed methodology rather than merely scaling up model parameters. 5.2.2 Synergy of Unified Modeling (RQ2). fundamental hypothesis underpinning our methodology is that unifying heterogeneous QP tasks into single generative paradigm fosters semantic synergy and facilitates positive knowledge transfer through shared latent representations. To empirically verify this, we conduct controlled experiment focusing on our Stage 1 phase. We compare the unified model against Task-Isolated baseline. In this controlled setting, we strictly align all experimental configurations (backbone, loss function, hyperparameters, etc.) with our Stage 1, varying only the data organization. Specifically, we partition the unified multi-task dataset into discrete task-specific subsets, which are then employed to train separate expert models for each QP task independently. Consequently, whereas QP-OneModel operates as single unified instance, the reported baseline metrics represent an aggregation of the best results achieved by each specialized model on its respective task. As presented in Table 2, the Unified model exhibits superior overall score (79.36% vs. 78.11%) by significantly outperforming the combined baseline on highly synergistic tasks that exhibit strong 6 mutual dependencies: NER, Word Segmentation, and Term Weighting. This validates the semantic synergy inherent in our sequential generation design. By modeling the joint probability of all tasks, the unified approach transforms the output of upstream tasks into explicit context for downstream tasks, thereby achieving better performance and efficiency than suite of isolated models. 5.2.3 Ablation Study (RQ3). To understand the source of improvements, we investigate the impact of the backbone model and our training strategies. Impact of Domain-Specific Backbone. To investigate the impact of backbone initialization, we conducted comparative analysis within the Stage 1 training phase by switching between the general-purpose Qwen3 backbone [37] and RedOne2.0 [38], domainadapted backbone for SNS. As shown in Table 3, the RedOne-based model demonstrates consistent advantage across all metrics, particularly in Word Segmentation (+0.25%) and Taxonomy (+0.69%). These gains indicate that domain-adaptive pre-training on massivescale SNS data effectively injects domain linguistic patterns, thereby providing significantly better initialization for SNS QP tasks compared to generic foundation model. Contribution of Progressive Alignment Stages. Table 4 validates our three-stage alignment strategy. Stage 2 (Target Alignment) yields consistent improvements over Stage 1 in overall score and specific sub-tasks. For the 8B model, overall score reaches 79.44%, with Taxonomy rising from 79.59% to 79.70%. similar trend is observed in the 0.6B model, where overall score moves from 77.95% to 78.27%, with NER improving from 80.88% to 81.91%. We suppose that fine-tuning on high-quality real-time unified data helps the model better align with the online data distribution and output schema. Stage 3 (RL) yields noticeable performance improvements, particularly on tasks that require robust semantic understanding. For the 8B model, we observe gains in Term QP-OneModel: Unified Generative LLM for Multi-Task Query Understanding in Xiaohongshu Search Table 1: Overall performance comparison on the offline Golden Test Set.

These results suggest that exploration with verifiable rewards enables models to learn nuanced rules that remain elusive under SFT. 5.2.4 Generalization on Emerging Tasks (RQ4). To assess the models capacity for transferring learned knowledge to novel problems, we evaluate its generalization capability on two emerging QP tasks that were not part of the original multi-task training curriculum. This serves as rigorous benchmark for the models \"meta-understanding\" of user search intent. Both evaluations are conducted in few-shot setting. The new tasks are defined as: Document Intent Recognition (Task 1): This task classifies queries based on whether the user intends to find document-style content (e.g., articles, long-form guides). 7 As Xiaohongshu diversifies its content ecosystem, accurately identifying this intent is crucial for guiding retrieval and ranking strategies, such as allocating specific quotas or applying ranking boosts for document-centric results. Authority Intent Recognition (Task 2): This task determines if query seeks authoritative or official information (e.g., from official brand websites, scientific sources). This signal is vital for downstream AI search applications, guiding decisions like triggering external API calls to highauthority search engines or prioritizing the indexing of content from trusted domains. Few-Shot In-Context Learning (ICL) Generalization. We first evaluate the models ability to generalize without any gradient updates, relying solely on in-context learning from few demonstration examples provided in the prompt. We benchmark against general LLMs (Qwen series) [25, 37] and the domain-specific RedOne family [38, 39]. As shown in Table 5, QP-OneModel-8B demonstrates remarkable ICL capabilities. For Document Intent, it achieves an accuracy of 82.40%, significantly surpassing not only its domain-adapted counterpart, RedOne-8B (75.80%), but also the much larger Qwen3-32B model (74.80%). For Authority Intent, our model attains competitive accuracy of 71.56%, performing on par with the 32B model and outperforming other models in its size class. These results strongly suggest that the multi-task, multi-stage alignment strategy has endowed QP-OneModel with robust, abstract understanding of query semantics, enabling it to effectively solve unseen tasks through prompting alone. Few-Shot Fine-Tuning Performance. Next, we assess the models adaptability by fine-tuning them on small set of task-specific data using LoRA [14]. QP-OneModel continues to exhibit superior performance. For Document Intent, QP-OneModel-8B achieves Macro F1 of 78.60, outperforming the RedOne-8B baseline. For Authority Intent, QP-OneModel-8B achieves the highest overall score (77.34%) and Macro F1 (72.76%) among all evaluated models. These suggest that the comprehensive training on core QP tasks, such as Term Weighting and NER, enables effective generalization to new domains upon fine-tuning."

Experiment 1: Fundamental Signal Evaluation. The goal of this experiment is to assess the accuracy of the core query processing signals. In the treatment group, we replaced the signals (including NER, taxonomy, and term weights) generated by the previous BERT-based model with those produced by QP-OneModel. Experiment 2: Downstream Application (Query Rewriting). This experiment evaluates the effectiveness of the \"Intent Descriptions\" generated by QP-OneModel in downstream tasks. We utilized Query Rewriting as the testbed, which leverages the original query and global statistical signals to generate rewrites that better satisfy the user intent. Control Group: Uses the current production baseline, LLM-based query rewriter. Treatment Group: Augments the baseline model with Intent Descriptions. These descriptions serve as Chainof-Thought (CoT) supervision during training and RAG inputs during inference. 5.3.2 Evaluation Metrics. We adopted the following metrics to measure performance. Note that for our platform, small absolute changes in these metrics can indicate statistical significance. DCG 0/1: relevance metric where professional annotators label top-8 results as relevant or irrelevant. This metric tracks the cumulative penalty of irrelevant results; lower value indicates higher ranking precision. An absolute decrease of 0.15 is considered statistically significant. Zero/Few-Result Rate: The percentage of queries returning extremely few results (typically 1-2 items). Note Effective CTR (NECTR): Measures clicks leading to meaningful engagement (e.g., long dwell time, likes). An absolute increase of 0.1% is considered statistically significant. SAU-Retention: The next-day retention rate of Search Active Users, serving as core indicator of user satisfaction. 5.3.3 Experimental Results. The online A/B test results are presented below. All reported changes represent absolute deltas. 8 Table 6: Online A/B testing results. Top: Evaluation of fundamental structural signals (NER, Term Weighting, etc.). Bottom: Verification of the Intent Descriptions effectiveness, showing that augmenting downstream Query Rewriting task with this novel generative output improves user retention."

In Experiment 1, replacing the baseline signals with QP-OneModel resulted in improved relevance. The DCG 0/1 metric decreased by 0.21%, which exceeds the significance threshold of 0.15%. We attribute this to the synergy between our unified paradigm, which mitigates error propagation, and the RL-driven alignment that enforces complex business logic. Additionally, the 0.4631% drop in Zero/Few-Result Rate validates our domain-specific backbone. We believe that by mastering informal slang during knowledge injection, the model bridges semantic gaps in long-tail queries where baselines failed. Downstream Application Performance. In Experiment 2, incorporating Intent Descriptions into the rewriting task improved user engagement metrics. The Note Effective CTR (NECTR) increased by +0.17%, which is statistically significant compared to the 0.1% threshold. Furthermore, the core SAU-Retention metric increased by +0.044%.

For the query \"1c1\", which consists solely of an alphanumeric code, discriminative baselines often struggle to extract meaningful features. In contrast, QP-OneModel successfully identifies the unmentioned parent brand (Estée Lauder) and infers the users implicit goal of shade comparison. This highlights the models ability to leverage internal knowledge to bridge the semantic gap in cryptic inputs. Resolving Polysemy and Enhancing Granularity. The model also effectively handles ambiguity and intent deepening. For \"163 Guards Tank Regiment\", it captures the multi-faceted nature of the query by identifying both the explicit military fact and the latent gaming context (simulation games). Furthermore, for \"retrox\", the model expands the product entity into actionable attributes such as wind resistance and price, providing downstream rankers with rich semantic signals."
