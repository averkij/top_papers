            "title": "1.1 Motivation and Challenges",
            "content": "LiDAR-based perception forms the foundation of modern autonomous systems, from self-driving vehicles to industrial robots. At its core, point cloud registration, enables these systems to build spatial understanding through applications in motion estimation Wu et al. (2022); Xue et al. (2025), mapping Ye et al. (2019); Qin et al. (2020); Shan et al. (2020); Hu et al. (2024a), localization ?Hu et al. (2024b), calibration Jiao et al. (2021b); Wu et al. (2019, 2021), and scene reconstruction Huang et al. (2021). Despite its fundamental importance, LiDAR registration remains inherently vulnerable to failure in geometrically degenerate environments such as corridors, tunnels, and open fields, where repetitive patterns or sparse features predominate. These challenging scenarios inherently lack sufficient geometric constraints along specific motion directions, resulting in rank-deficient or near-singular information matrices Nashed et al. (2021) that render the optimization problem ill-conditioned. This numerical ill-conditioning makes the solution highly sensitive to sensor noise and initial estimates, which manifests as amplified error propagation and unstable solutions, ultimately leading to catastrophic failures in autonomous navigation. Consequently, even minor perturbations in sensor measurements or initial estimates can Prepared using sagej.cls [Version: 2017/01/17 v1.20] induce catastrophic divergence in the solution, precipitating complete navigation failure. The ability to understand and resolve such ill-conditioning is thus not merely technical optimization but prerequisite for deploying reliable autonomous systems for real-world applications. Current approaches Tuna et al. (2023, 2025); Zhang et al. (2016) typically adopt detect-then-mitigate paradigm, yet they fail to address the fundamental questions: when, why, and how does registration become ill-conditioned? This failure stems from three interconnected challenges: When to detect: Existing detection methods Hinduja et al. (2024b); Tuna et al. (2023); Zhang and Singh (2014) analyze the the (2019); Hu et al. 1Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China 2Department of Mechanical Engineering at National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan 3School of Intelligent Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China 4University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies and the University of Toronto Robotics Institute, Toronto, Canada Corresponding author: Jin Wu, Full Professor, School of Intelligent Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China Email: wujin@ustb.edu.cn 2 The International Journal of Robotics Research 00(0) Hessian spectral in optimization, where inherent scale disparity and coupling effects between translation and rotation mask critical ill-conditioning patterns. This coupling causes rotational degeneracy to be masked by translational eigenvalues, leading to missed detections or over-detections in precisely those scenarios where robots are most vulnerable. Why it fails: Even when ill-conditioning is detected, current methods Hu et al. (2024b); Hinduja et al. (2019) cannot explain which physical motions are degenerate and characterize to what extent they are degenerate. The mathematical abstractions (eigenvectors) remain ambiguous from the physical reality of robot motion, leaving practitioners without actionable insights for navigation decisions or system design improvements. How to mitigate: Existing mitigation strategies, whether regularization Golub et al. (1999); Tuna et al. (2025), truncation Hansen (1990), or remapping Zhang and Singh (2014); Zhang et al. (2016), apply blanket corrections that fundamentally alter the optimization problem. They either inject artificial constraints where none exist or discard valid information, inadvertently corrupting well-constrained directions while attempting to stabilize ill-conditioned ones. These fundamental limitations motivate us to rethink illconditioned registration from first principles. Rather than treating it as an inevitable failure mode requiring external sensors or ad-hoc workarounds, we ask: can we develop self-contained numerical framework that fundamentally understands and resolves ill-conditioning? Specifically, we seek an approach that: (i) reliably detects ill-conditioning by properly accounting for the inherent structure of the registration problem; (ii) provides quantitative, physically interpretable diagnosis of specific degenerate motions; and (iii) stabilizes the optimization without corrupting wellconstrained directions. Our goal is real-time solution that maintains mathematical integrity, ultimately enabling robust autonomous operation where current methods fail."

            "content": "This paper introduces comprehensive framework to address ill-conditioned LiDAR registration problems. Our first contribution (Section 4) is scale-robust and coupling-aware formulation for ill-conditioning detection that addresses fundamental limitations of traditional eigenvaluebased frameworks. Due to inherent scale disparities between translation and rotation (Section 3.3) and environmental variations, we analyze eigen-spectral properties by separating translation and rotation subspaces (Section 4.2). This scaleconsistent approach avoids both overand under-detection without frequent parameter tuning (Section 4.3), unlike full Hessian analysis Hinduja et al. (2019); Zhang and Singh (2014); Zhang et al. (2016). Crucially, our novel approach employs the Schur complement to properly account for coupling effects between translation and rotation components (Section 4.4), enabling analysis within clean subspaces that exposes hidden degeneracies masked by conventional methods Tuna et al. (2023). While detecting ill-conditioning in translation or rotation subspaces is necessary, such detection remains insufficient Prepared using sagej.cls for guiding practical applications without mapping to specific physical motion directions Hu et al. (2024b); Zhang et al. (2016). This challenge stems from inherent ambiguities in Eigen Decomposition (EVD) or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), eigenvectors are typically arranged by ascending/descending eigenvalues without physical meaning. Additionally, when eigenvalue clustering occurs (near multiplicity), the eigen direction within degenerate subspaces become poorly constrained that lack consistent physical correspondence during iterations. To tackle this issue, our second contribution (Section 5) is physically interpretable directional ill-conditioning analysis with quantitative characterization. We demonstrate how to: (i) identify specific ill-conditioned directions within subspaces via inner product analysis (Section 5.1), (ii) solve for the linear coefficients that combine ill-conditioned directions and physical motion axes (Section 5.2), and (iii) construct stable orthogonal bases aligned with parameter space using GramSchmidt orthogonalization to ensure interpretability despite eigenvector ambiguities (Section 5.3). Our third contribution (Section 6) is targeted illconditioning mitigation solver that transforms the original illconditioned problem into an equivalent but well-conditioned optimization while preserving all constraint information. Unlike Tikhonov regularization Golub et al. (1999); Tuna et al. (2025) or truncated SVD Hansen (1990) that indiscriminately modify the problem by either adding artificial constraints or discarding valid information, our approach maintains the integrity of the original problem (Section 6.3). Leveraging the aligned orthogonal bases and clean subspaces, we design preconditioner that performs cluster-wise eigenvalue clamping, applying uniform spectral modification within each degenerate subspace to avoid numerical artifacts (Section 6.2). This enables targeted stabilization via preconditioned conjugate gradient (Section 6.1) with single interpretable parameter controlling the condition number bound. Our fourth contribution (Section 7.5) demonstrates the scalability and efficiency of our framework in real-world robotics applications. Our detection module can be seamlessly integrated with existing mitigation methods, significantly enhancing performance in degenerate registration scenarios (Section 7.5.2). Furthermore, benefiting from the convergence properties and the implementation of our methods, we achieve 5-100 times speedup compared to state-of-the-art approaches in long-duration experiments (Section 7.3.2)."

Alternative approaches utilize various quantitative metrics of covariance matrices, including determinants, traces, and Doptimality Carrillo et al. (2015); Liu et al. (2021); Jiao et al. (2021a); Khattak et al. (2020); Zhao et al. (2024b). Despite their theoretical foundation, these uncertainty-based metrics exhibit even greater sensitivity to environmental variations than minimum eigenvalue approaches, exacerbating the parameter tuning challenge. To address parameter sensitivity, Nashed et al. (2021) proposed using condition numbers of the full Hessian matrix, yielding more consistent detection metrics. Nevertheless, this method struggles with the inherent scale disparity between rotation and translation parameters, since rotational eigenvalues typically exceed translational ones by orders of magnitude, making rotational degeneracies particularly elusive to detect. Several variants attempt to resolve the scale disparity through subspace decomposition. Methods proposed in Rong and Michael (2016); Hinduja et al. (2019); Tagliabue et al. (2021); Ebadi et al. (2023) compute relative condition numbers for translation and rotation components separately using diagonal Hessian blocks. While this provides more reliable detection without frequent retuning, it overlooks the coupling effects between translation and rotation. Similar limitations affect the diagonal block analysis in Tuna et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2024a), leading to both false positives and false negatives in degeneracy detection. fundamental limitation shared by these spectral methods is their inability to provide quantitative characterization of degeneracy patterns. Current approaches Hu et al. (2024b) incorrectly assume direct correspondence between motion parameter space (e.g., X/Y/Z axes) and eigenspace, neglecting the difference in their basis vectors. This misconception leads to imprecise characterizations such as X-axis degeneracy and subsequently compromises mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the inherent ambiguity of eigenvectors from EVD/SVD causes eigenvalues to lose their parameter space correspondence when sorted, particularly problematic in scenarios with combined ill-conditioning across multiple motion directions."

This coupling, also scaling with point distances, causes error propagation between parameter sets and complicates the optimization landscape. To analyze the mathematical properties of ill-conditioning, we examine the Hessian matrix through SVD, revealing the underlying geometric structure of the parameter space. The SVD of the Hessian is given by: = ΣV . (9) where λmin is the smallest eigenvalue of H. Similarly, for the original system: where and are orthogonal matrices containing the left and right singular vectors, and Σ is diagonal matrix of singular values σi.

(18a) (18b) (18c) (18d) The correction terms MR and Mt quantify the bidirectional influence between rotation and translation, potentially revealing ill-conditioning that remains hidden in isolated analysis when strong coupling exists. The condition numbers of these Schur complements, reveal the effective curvature and true sensitivity after optimally accommodating the complementary motion components (Theorem 1). In the Jacobian space, this is equivalent to orthogonally removing components explicable by the complementary subspace (Proposition 1), while maintaining strict invariance to uniform scaling of the eliminated block (Proposition 2). Consequently, our decoupled methods can provide insights that conventional analysis would miss."

Unless otherwise specified, we assume Htt 0 and HRR 0, so that SR and St are well-defined (Generalizations using the Moore-Penrose inverse). Theorem 1. Elimination-Curvature Equivalence. For the Hessian H, the Schur complements SR and St satisfy: (i) The reduced quadratic after eliminating δt has Hessian SR: Q(ϕ) = 1 2 ϕSRϕ R ϕ + const (ii) Under perturbation gR in the reduced gradient: ϕ2 ϕ2 κ(SR) gR2 gR2 Analogous results hold for St when eliminating ϕ. Prepared using sagej.cls (22) (23) 7 Proof : See Section A.1. This theorem demonstrates that rotation and translation sensitivities are governed by SR and St, with their condition numbers κ(SR) and κ(St) bounding the relative error is, SR is precisely the Hessian of amplification. That the rotation subproblem after optimally accommodating translation; hence spectral analysis on the rotation subproblem is equivalent (the sensitivity of ϕ) to analyzing the full problem with δt eliminated. This property enables Schur complements to expose hidden degeneracy by optimally accounting for inter-block coupling degeneracy that remain invisible when analyzing diagonal blocks in isolation. Proposition 1. Projection Representation. Consider the Jacobian matrix = [JR Jt] Rm6, where JR Rm3 and Jt Rm3 represent the rotational and translational components, respectively. Let Pt denote the orthogonal projection operator onto range(Jt) with Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, given by Pt JtJ + . (24) Then, the rotational stiffness matrix SR can be expressed as SR = (Im Pt)JR, (25) where Im Rmm is the identity matrix, and (Im Pt) projects onto the orthogonal complement of range(Jt). For the weighted case with positive definite information matrix 0, the corresponding -orthogonal projector is given by (W ) , and the weighted rotational stiffness matrix becomes Jt)+J Jt(J SR = (Im (W ) )JR, (26) where the projections are performed with respect to the - inner product u, vW = uW v. Proof : See Section A.2. This projection removes components of range(JR) that can be explained by Jt, retaining only the rotation information that cannot be compensated by translation. Consequently, the eigenvalues of SR in the projected subspace accurately reflect the rotational information of the corresponding subproblem. Proposition 2. Scaleand Orthogonal-Basis Invariance. The Schur complements exhibit scale and orthogonal-basis invariance: (i) (Scale invariance) For any > 0, if δt = δt so that Htt (cid:55) s2Htt and HRt (cid:55) sHRt, then = SR. (ii) (Orthogonal-basis invariance) If the retained block undergoes an orthogonal change of basis JR (cid:55) JRQ with SO(3), then SR (cid:55) QSRQ, preserving the spectrum and thus κ(SR). Analogous results hold for St and κ(St). Proof : See Section A.3. This property demonstrates that Schur complements naturally eliminate sensitivity to unit or scale changes in the eliminated parameters, directly addressing the scale disparity between rotation (radians) and translation (meters). If the translation unit is rescaled as with > 0, the Hessian 8 The International Journal of Robotics Research 00(0) blocks transform proportionally as Htt s2 and HRt s. These factors cancel in MR, hence SR is invariant to this scaling. More general (non-orthogonal) re-parameterizations do not necessarily preserve the condition number. Theorem 2. Spectral Bounds for Schur Conditioning. Let MR and Mt denote the coupling matrices, MR 0 and Mt 0, the spectral properties satisfy: (i) Loewner ordering: SR HRR and St Htt, (ii) Eigenvalue bounds: For {1, 2, 3}, λi(HRR) λmax(MR) λi(SR) λi(HRR).

While our Schur complement in approach successfully eliminate the coupling effect subspaces, the eigenvectors obtained from these decoupled matrices require further interpretation to guide practical regularization strategies. Let ER = {vR,1, vR,2, vR,3} and Et = {vt,1, vt,2, vt,3} represent the eigenvector sets from our Schur complement analysis, sorted by ascending eigenvalues. In practical robotics scenarios, these eigenvectors exhibit three forms of ambiguity that complicate physical interpretation: (iii) Condition number bounds: Under the assumption λmin(HRR) > λmax(MR), κ(SR) λmax(HRR) λmin(HRR) λmax(MR) (29) (iv) Near-cancellation: Let S2 attain the minimum Rayleigh quotient of SR. Then MRv = v HRRv λmin(SR) λmin(HRR) λmin(SR). (30) (31) Hence, if λmin(SR) λmin(HRR), the coupling term nearly cancels the rotational curvature along v: MRv HRRv 1 1 λmin(SR) HRRv λmin(SR) λmin(HRR) . (32) (33) Analogous results hold for St, κ(St) and λi(St). Proof : See Section A.4. Remark 1. From (i) and (ii), SR and St are not guaranteed to be better-conditioned than their diagonal block HRR and Htt. As the Loewner ordering ? implies that: λmin(SR) λmin(HRR), λmax(SR) λmax(HRR). Consequently, κ(SR) may be smaller than κ(HRR) when coupling is weak, or substantially larger when coupling is strong. So the Schur complements can reveal hidden degeneracy induced by coupling: even when the diagonal block appears well-conditioned, subtracting the coupling MR may reduce the smallest eigenvalue, inflating κ(SR). Remark 2. (iii) provides finite upper bound for the SPD regime; As λmax(MR) λmin(HRR), we have κ(SR) , revealing degeneracy masked by diagonal-block analysis. Remark 3. (iv) shows that the real observability information can be masked by the cross terms (MR and Mt). This constitutes the degeneration mechanism being covered on HRR, observable only in SR. Finally, it gives quantitative form of the masking mechanism. Prepared using sagej.cls Sign ambiguity: The arbitrary sign of eigenvectors (v or v) creates inconsistent physical interpretations. For instance, robots rotational uncertainty around the vertical axis could be represented by either = [0, 0, 1] or = [0, 0, 1], though they represent the same physical constraint. Ordering ambiguity: In corridor-like environments, where motion and roll are similarly constrained, corresponding eigenvalues become nearly identical or the spectral gap is small, making their natural ordering unstable across iterations or frames. Basis ambiguity: In planar scenarios, where the robot may be constrained to move in the horizontal plane, multiple linearly independent vectors within this plane could equally represent the degenerate subspace, leading to arbitrary basis choices by the eigen decomposition. In this section, we present principled alignment framework comprising three steps (Figure 4 and Algorithm 2): inner-product matching (Section 5.1), maximum component analysis (Section 5.2), and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (Section 5.3) to address these ambiguities."

This strategy is applied independently to rotational and translational eigenvalues with their respective parameters λR,max, λt,max, and κtg. This cluster-wise constant clamping formulation ensures that despite potential arbitrary rotations of eigenvectors within degenerate subspaces, the overall spectral modification remains consistent and basis-invariant. The clamping operates uniformly on all eigenvalues within each cluster, avoiding numerical artifacts that could arise from arbitrary eigenvector orientations (Section 5.3). The elegance of this approach lies in its selective intervention: well-conditioned eigenvalues remain unmodified, preserving their natural convergence behavior, while illconditioned eigenvalues are clamped to ensure bounded condition number. Through this targeted preconditioning, the condition number of the system is maintained within welldefined range regardless of degeneracy severity, thereby mitigating noise amplification in weakly-constrained directions and accelerating convergence. Crucially, the preconditioner modifies only the iterative geometry and convergence rate without altering the minimum of the original problem. Unlike global TReg, which overdamps well-conditioned directions, or TSVD, which discards weak information entirely, our eigenvalue clamping strategy performs minimal necessary spectral shaping exclusively within degenerate subspaces.

SuperLoc exhibits substantial translation and rotation errors, indicating registration failure. Although XICP achieves the smallest translation error, its large rotation error and high Chamfer distance confirm misalignment. In contrast, our method achieves optimal performance across rotation error, Chamfer distance, ICP residual, and fitness metrics, requiring only the second-fewest iterations for successful convergence. Furthermore, our algorithm demonstrates 2 10 times efficient compared to baseline methods. These results validate that degeneracy detection coupled with targeted mitigation strategies effectively influences convergence and accuracy throughout the iterative process. Regarding degeneracy detection, ME-based methods focus exclusively on absolute information while neglecting translation-rotation scale disparity, leading to over-detection in translational part. FCN-based approaches overlook coupling effects, resulting in simultaneous over-detection in both translation and rotation. More critically, the degeneracy mitigation strategy directly influences optimization trajectories during iterations. SR handle degeneracy too conservatively, TSVD discards information from multiple dimensions entirely, and TReg processes all dimensions uniformly, inadvertently introducing noise into well-conditioned dimensions. Our method uniquely achieves correct convergence.

This analysis validates the practical importance of efficient degeneracy handling in resource-constrained scenarios. Componentwise timing analysis in Table 7 reveals the computational costs across four key modules: degeneracy detection, mitigation, correspondence establishment, and Hessian matrix construction. Across multiple datasets, degeneracy detection and mitigation consume minimal computational resources while ensuring convergence. Correspondence establishment dominates processing time, followed by Hessian construction. Since correspondence quality directly depends on initial pose accuracy, these results underscore the critical role of reliable degeneracy handling in overall computational efficiency. Frame-level analysis in Table 8 compares ICP iteration counts and registration times for degenerate versus nondegenerate frames across different methods. Non-degenerate frames naturally require fewer iterations and less processing time due to the absence of degeneracy issues. For degenerate frames, DCReg consistently achieves the lowest computational cost and competitive iteration counts.

Figure 12 demonstrates the dimensional detection capabilities on the parking lot dataset, revealing fundamental differences in detection strategies. The FCN consistently three translational dimensions (v0-v2) as identifies all degenerate throughout the process, while ME focuses primarily on the two smallest eigenvalue dimensions (v0, v1). In contrast, DCReg simultaneously detects both translational and rotational degeneracy while correctly identifying the largest translational eigenvalue direction as non-degenerate. This behavior stems from the scale disparity problem inherent in ME and FCN approaches: translational eigenvalues consistently maintain lower magnitudes than rotational counterparts, resulting in persistently large eigenvalue ratios. Consequently, ME exhibit insufficient detection by overlooking larger eigenvalue directions, while FCN demonstrate over-detection by treating all translational dimensions as universally degenerate. Our subspace decoupling strategy effectively addresses this fundamental limitation, achieving more balanced degeneracy detection across dimensional spaces. Figure 13 presents the condition number evolution during iterative optimization, revealing critical insights into how coupling effects between translational and rotational components impact degeneracy detection reliability. For the translational subspace, the Schur condition numbers closely align with their diagonal counterparts throughout the optimization process. This consistency can be attributed to our pose parameterization scheme (R3 SO(3)), where translation parameters maintain relative independence from rotational components in the Hessian structure. In contrast, the rotational subspace exhibits significant disparities between Schur and diagonal condition numbers, with values that can be either substantially higher or lower than diagonal estimates. This phenomenon provides empirical validation of Theorem 2, demonstrating that coupling effects fundamentally alter the conditioning characteristics of rotational components. Particularly noteworthy are regions and B, which correspond to the planar degeneracy scenario illustrated in Figure 16. Under identical degeneracy thresholds, the Schur condition number successfully identifies the ill-conditioning, whereas the diagonal condition number incorrectly classifies the configuration as well-constrained. This discrepancy demonstrates that coupling effects can mask degeneracies when using diagonal analysis, while our Schur complement approach reliably exposes these hidden singularities. Statistical analysis across multiple datasets in Figure 14 quantifies the detection characteristics of three methods. FCN exhibits systematic over-detection, ME demonstrates insufficient detection, while DCReg achieves balanced detection rates that better reflect actual degeneracy conditions.

This performance advantage likely stems from the spectral analysis characteristics in corridor scenarios, where eigenvector ordering ambiguity (Figure 17) causes eigenvalues of degenerate rotational dimensions to approximate those of multiple translational dimensions. Under such conditions, directly discarding degenerate dimensional information may paradoxically yield better rank approximation effects. Conversely, TReg requires frequent parameter adjustments based on eigenvalue magnitudes to achieve optimal performance, which proves impractical in real-world applications. The complete DCReg algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in both trajectory and mapping accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to baseline methods. These results underscore that precise degeneracy detection combined with targeted mitigation substantially enhances overall registration accuracy in degenerate scenarios.

First, during periods of severe degeneracy, the original problem exhibits dramatic condition number spikes, indicating numerical instability that directly correlates with the observed ATE degradation in Region A.

This parameter design offers significant advantages over alternative approaches. Unlike ME methods that require environment-specific parameter tuning, or FCN approaches that necessitate frequent adjustments due to scale discrepancies between translational and rotational eigenvalues, our subspace-based detection threshold possesses clear physical interpretation. The threshold is determined solely by eigenvalue ratios across different dimensions, eliminating the need for case-by-case parameter optimization. The targeted PCG module involves three parameters: the target subspace condition number κ, PCG iteration tolerance, and maximum iteration count. The latter two parameters demonstrate remarkable stability across applications. Setting the tolerance to 1 106 consistently achieves convergence within 10 iterations, rendering these parameters practically invariant across different scenarios. Figure 19 presents comprehensive analysis of target condition number κtg variations on the parkinglot dataset, examining trajectory accuracy, mapping precision, and average PCG iteration counts. When κ ranges from 1 to 10, both ATE and mapping accuracy remain remarkably stable while average PCG iterations increase gradually. This behavior validates our theoretical analysis in Section 6.3, confirming that smaller condition numbers accelerate convergence and that subspace condition number control effectively influences overall optimization performance. Theoretical analysis in Section 6.3 establishes that the optimal target condition number should satisfy 1 < κ < 10. Values exceeding this range can induce information loss in mildly degenerate scenarios. This prediction is also empirically confirmed in Figure 19, where configurations with κ {20, 50, 100} exhibit significant degradation in both trajectory and mapping accuracy, validating our theoretical framework. Based on these findings, we recommend setting the κtg equal to the threshold κth in practical implementations, ensuring consistency between detection and mitigation strategies while maintaining optimal performance across diverse scenarios."

The targeted-PCG solver provides directional condition number enhancement for Figure 18. Trajectory error and ATE comparison over time between DCReg and DCReg-SR on the parkinglot dataset. DCReg-SR exhibits significantly increased errors (Resion and B) during trajectory segments where XY and Yaw degenerate simultaneously, demonstrating the advantages of our targeted PCG method over SR. numerical stability and convergence characteristics. This observation underscores the practical value of our approach in realistic scenarios where environmental geometry introduces conditioning challenges without complete information loss. The convergence basin of point cloud registration algorithms imposes critical constraint on degeneracy mitigation effectiveness. When initial pose estimates fall outside this basin, optimization becomes trapped in local minima, rendering degeneracy analysis ineffective regardless of the mitigation strategy employed. Conversely, given reasonable initial poses within the convergence domain, degeneracy mitigation can strategically adjust pose estimation during optimization iterations, guiding the solution toward correct global optima and thereby enhancing both robustness and efficiency of registration algorithms. This analysis reveals that reliable degenerate registration depends on the interplay between three factors: environmental Prepared using sagej.cls identified degenerate directions, improving convergence and optimization stability. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis for both modules, representing the rigorous treatment of their kind for degenerate registration problems. Extensive validation across simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates four key advantages: (1) significant improvements in trajectory and mapping accuracy during long-duration slam tasks, (2) enhanced convergence reliability with 5 100 speedup in average registration performance, (3) quantitative characterization of degeneracy sources across diverse scenarios, and (4) seamless integration capability with existing degeneracy mitigation methods while achieving accuracy improvements. Our efficient open-source C++ implementation facilitates broader adoption. Beyond core contributions, DCReg provides fundamental analytical framework revealing that pose estimation depends entirely on correspondence pairs that evolve with initial poses during iteration. Consequently, degeneracy stems not only from repetitive geometric features (e.g., tunnels) but also from sparse environments and poor initial poses causing insufficient constraints. This insight opens numerous research opportunities for advancing LiDAR-based safe and reliable perception systems. Future work includes extending degeneracy analysis and mitigation to long-duration localization scenarios and investigating applications in multimodal sensor fusion and dynamic environment handling. The theoretical framework established here provides foundation for addressing ill-conditioned estimation problems across diverse robotic perception tasks."

Setting δtQ = 0: HtRϕ + Httδt + gt = 0 (52) Solving for optimal δt given ϕ: δt(ϕ) = 1 tt (HtRϕ + gt) (53) Step 2: Reduced objective. Substituting δt(ϕ) into Q: Qred(ϕ) = Q(cid:0)ϕ, δt(ϕ)(cid:1) = 1 2 ϕHRRϕ + ϕHRtδt(ϕ) 2 δt(ϕ)Httδt(ϕ) + + 1 ϕ + t δt(ϕ).

(cid:1) (cid:125) (55) This establishes part (i). Step 3: Sensitivity analysis. The reduced normal equation is: SRϕ = gR Under perturbation gR (cid:55) gR + gR: SR(ϕ + ϕ) = (gR + gR) Therefore SRϕ = gR, yielding: gR2 S1 min(SR) gR2. ϕ2 = = λ1 2 gR2 (56) (57) (58) Similarly, Combining: ϕ2 = S1 gR2 gR2 SR2 = gR2 λmax(SR) . 23 Since Pt is an orthogonal projector (satisfying = Pt and = Pt), the operator (Im Pt) is the orthogonal projector onto range(Jt) = null(J ). This projection removes components of range(JR) that can be explained by Jt, retaining only the rotational information that cannot be compensated by translation. Weighted Case. Let Rmm be positive definite information matrix (W 0). Define the whitened Jacobians as: 1/2J Rm6, JR 1/2JR Rm3, Jt 1/2Jt Rm3. The weighted Hessian matrix becomes: = = J . (66) (67) (68) (69) Following the same decomposition, the weighted Schur complement is: SR = JR Jt (cid:0)J Jt (cid:1)+ JR.

Consider the Jacobian decomposition = [JR Jt] Rm6, where JR Rm3 and Jt Rm3 represent the rotational and translational components, respectively. The associated Hessian matrix admits the block structure: = = (cid:20)J JR JR Jt Jt (cid:21) = (cid:20)HRR HRt HtR Htt (cid:21) , (60) where HRR = tR = HRt = JR R33, Htt = Jt R33. Jt R33, and The orthogonal projector onto range(Jt) using the MoorePenrose pseudoinverse is: (W ) Jt (cid:0)J Jt (cid:1)+ .
