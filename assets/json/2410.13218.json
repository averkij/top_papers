            "content": "Mental health conditions have reached alarming levels globally, with one in eight people affected, according to the World Health Organization (2023)2. There is severe shortage of mental health professionals. In the U.S., more than 160 million people live in areas with insufficient mental health *Equal contributions. 1The data and code are released at https://github.com/ mianzhang/CBT-Bench. providers, with rural regions being especially underserved3. This critical gap underscores the need for AI-driven tools to support professionals and expand access to care. Existing research has explored mental health condition classifications (Gao et al., 2018; Senn et al., 2022), empathetic conversations (Sharma et al., 2021, 2023a; Adikari et al., 2022), and chatbots designed for simple discourse structures (Hsu et al., 2023). However, work on professional assistance in real therapy settings remain limited. Some studies have addressed specific tasks in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (Beck, 2020), such as cognitive distortion classification (Chen et al., 2023b). However, there are many other critical stages in CBT that could potentially be enhanced through automation. In this work, we aim to thoroughly investigate the proficiency and potential of LLMs in supporting various facets and stages of professional mental health care. To this end, we propose CBT-BENCH, systematic benchmark for evaluating CBT efficacy. CBT-BENCH is structured in three levels, from CBT knowledge recitation to the therapeutic responses generation in CBT sessions, providing hierarchical assessment of CBT capabilities. To ensure the professionalism and high quality of our benchmark, we collaborate with domain experts (clinical psychologists, professors, and social workers) throughout the construction of CBT-BENCH. In level I, we aim to assess basic CBT knowledge acquisition. We propose CBT-QA, new dataset of 220 multiple-choice questions. The QA pairs are collected from CBT exam questions for Master of Social Work (MSW) students as well as compositions from CBT experts, covering wide range of CBT knowledge, including basic concepts, practical knowledge, and case studies. In level II, we aim to assess cognitive model 2https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-mental-health3https://bhw.hrsa.gov/data-research/review-healthday/2023 workforce-research 1 understanding. Modeling how the cognitive components of the patients, such as the beliefs and thoughts, are connected, is at the core of CBT (Beck, 2020; Kuyken et al., 2011). In this work, we propose CBT-CD, new dataset of cognitive distortion classification with 146 high-quality examples. We also propose two new tasks to assess the understanding of patients beliefs: primary core belief classification and fine-grained core belief classification. For primary core belief classification, we construct CBT-PC, new dataset of 184 examples with three primary core belief categories. For fine-grained core belief classification, we propose CBT-FC, new dataset of 112 examples with nineteen fine-grained core belief categories. Building AI models for such tasks to assist the cognitive modeling process has the great potential to enhance therapists accuracy and productivity. In level III, we aim to evaluate therapeutic response generation, the ultimate CBT efficacy whether the model can effectively respond to patient speech during CBT sessions like the therapists. Due to the privacy constraints associated with real CBT session data, accessing extensive datasets is challenging. In collaboration with professors specialized in CBT education, we propose CBT-DP, using Deliberate Practice as outlined in (Boswell and Constantino, 2022) for our assessment. This methodology is traditionally employed in assessing CBT proficiency among graduate students. It encompasses collection of exercises to respond to typical patient speeches across ten key aspects of CBT sessions, categorized into three levels of difficulty, totaling 156 distinct exercises. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of critical and challenging scenarios likely to occur in real sessions. Generating high-quality responses to patient speeches in CBT-DP can serve as an effective proxy for real CBT session efficacy. We experiment with six popular LLMs for level and level II in CBT-BENCH and find that 1) the models of large sizes are better at answering CBT knowledge questions; 2) simply making the models larger could not enhance their understanding ability of the cognitive model; 3) current LLMs struggle with detecting fine-grained cognitive disorders or core beliefs. deeper analysis of the model performance for each class points out the main reasons of wrong prediction and directions to improve the corresponding ability of the models. For the level III task, we find that LLMs generally follow rigid logical reasoning process but lack crucial skill in psychotherapythinking and guiding from the patients perspective to respect their autonomy and build rapport. These findings highlight significant limitations in applying LLMs to real-world psychotherapy practice and provide valuable insights for future research and development toward more accessible and efficient mental health care."

            "content": "Our work is the first to systematically evaluate LLMs ability to assist professional human therapists in the specialized field of CBT. The works directly related to our research include injecting domain knowledge of mental health into the models (Yang et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024), cognitive disorder detection (Shreevastava and Foltz, 2021a; Wang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023c), negative thoughts recognition and reframing (Sharma et al., 2023b; Maddela et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2024), and patient simulation (Chen et al., 2023a) or therapist simulation (Liu et al., 2023) in therapeutic conversation. Wang et al. (2024) proved that with clear modeling of the cognitive model of patients, LLMs could act more like real patients. Also, we believe that enhancing the understanding of the cognitive models of patients could be beneficial to interpretable medical decisions (Yang et al., 2023), which is crucial step towards reliable and safe automated mental healthcare (Ji et al., 2023; Grabb et al., 2024). In the proposed therapeutic response generation task, we leverage the feedback from professional therapists to assess the potential of LLMs responding like therapist in real therapy sessions, while Louie et al. (2024) explored how to make LLMs roleplay patients with the feedback from professional therapists."

            "content": "To evaluate the basic CBT knowledge acquired by LLMs, we propose new dataset, CBT-QA, encompassing 220 multiple-choice questions. We first worked with two social work professors and collected 92 multiple-choice questions from the exams they issued for graduate CBT courses. Each question has 2-5 answer choices. Then, we hired four CBT experts to compose new QA pairs, using the QA pairs from the exam source as guidance, and each expert was tasked with composing 50. To ensure high quality, we required the experts to cross-verify the QA pairs and excluded those deemed of low quality. We ended up with 178 highquality QA pairs, which, when combined with the 92 ones sourced from exams, resulted in our CBTQA dataset of 270 QA pairs. We randomly selected 50 ones for use such as in-context learning examples. The remaining 220 pairs were designated as the final test set. To get better understanding of the fine-grained knowledge types involved in CBT-QA, we employed another two CBT experts to categorize the test set into four categories. Table 1 shows example QA pairs from the four categories and corresponding distributions in the test set. See Appendix for more examples. To assess human performance, we employed another two CBT experts to solve the test set and ended up with an average accuracy of 90.7% with an agreement rate over 80%."

            "title": "3.2 Level II: Cognitive Model Understanding",
            "content": "In the exam setting of CBT-QA, most questions assess the models ability to recite knowledge, as 4www.upwork.com LLMs may have seen this information during pretrainingespecially when it comes to basic CBT knowledge and concepts that are prevalent online. However, knowledge recitation alone is insufficient to support the effective use of LLMs in assisting real practice. To address this, we propose the Level II task set: cognitive model understanding. In CBT, therapists develop cognitive model to represent patients unhealthy cognitive processes that contribute to their mental health issues (Beck, 2020). cognitive model typically includes beliefs, thoughts, emotions, and other relevant elements. The associations among these components provide clear representation of the patients maladaptive cognitive process (See Appendix for an example cognitive model). Constructing patients cognitive model is crucial step in CBT (Beck, 2020; Beck and Haigh, 2014; Wang et al., 2024), as therapists must first summarize these maladaptive structures before working to correct them. We believe that the process of cognitive model construction can be effectively enhanced with the assistance of LLMs, which could help in automatically identifying key componentssuch as beliefs and thought patternsand their associations. Existing work mostly focuses on cognitive distortion classification (Sharma et al., 2023c; Shreevastava and Foltz, 2021b; Chen et al., 2023b) classifying the maladaptive thinking patterns in patients speech, which can be viewed as one component of cognitive modeling. However, existing datasets are typically limited by poor quality (Shreevastava and Foltz, 2021b; Chen et al., 2023b) or simplicity of the input speech. In our Level II tasks, we first propose new dataset, CBTCD, for cognitive distortion classification with en3 Datasets Inputs CBT-CD CBT-PC Situation: Our wedding was put off because his parents asked him to build house for them 2 months before our wedding! They had perfectly good house at the time they just wanted their dream house.

His parents do not want us to get married. He may not want to marry me either. He loves his parents more than me. will always be second in his life. His parents had no need for house, and know this for sure. am aware of every aspect of this situation. Situation: had an amazing childhood. When was twelve in 2004, my father had to go to Iraq. My mother thought it would be best if she moved my brother and back to the U.S., where we would have family support. was very depressed because my dad was my hero and blamed my mom for everything that went wrong. felt like no one understood me... When my dad came back, he wanted divorce from my mother. Thoughts: Everything was great until my mom messed everything up. Because of her, my brother and had to leave our dad. We ended up living somewhere where no one liked me. Its her fault that never felt like fit in. Even when my dad came back, he didnt want us either - he wanted divorce. guess no one will ever want me in their life. Ill probably be alone forever.

We use the label set in (Shreevastava and Foltz, 2021b) of ten distortion types. We then propose two new tasks centered on core beliefs. Core beliefs are at the center of patients cognitive modeldeeply ingrained perceptions about oneself, others, and the world (Beck, 2020). Eliciting core beliefs is one of the most challenging stages of cognitive modeling, while the essential focus in later sessions is to correct such unhealthy, biased core beliefs. According to (Beck, 2020), there are three primary core beliefs: helpless, unlovable, and worthless. Each of these categories encompasses more specific, fine-grained core beliefs. For example, am incompetent and am loser fall under helpless. In total, these fine-grained core beliefs are classified into 19 categories. In our Level II tasks, we propose new datasets CBT-PC for primary core belief classification, and CBT-FC for fine-grained core belief classification. Check Appendix for detailed label definitions and distribution for all three datasets. We use the patient speech in the TherapistQA dataset (Shreevastava and Foltz, 2021b), sourced from mental health-related posts in online forums, as our data source to construct CBT-CD, CBT-PC, and CBT-FC. Our annotation process is as follows: (1) From each original post, we instruct the expert annotators to extract segment that describes situation along with the associated thoughts. Annotators may also create plausible imagined situations and thoughts to supplement the original segments if they are insufficiently detailed. (2) For cognitive distortions, we instruct the experts to annotate up to three key ones. For primary core beliefs and fine-grained core beliefs, we instruct the experts to annotate up to three primary beliefs. Under each identified primary core belief, we annotate up to three fine-grained beliefs. We employed total of six CBT experts from UpWork to conduct the annotation. Check Appendix for our annotation interface. We conducted another round of cross-verification to filter out the low-quality ones. We end up with 146 examples for CBT-CD, 184 examples for CBT-PC, and 112 examples for CBT-FC. We also have another 20 examples for each task serving as other potential uses. Table 2 and 3 presents some statistics and examples of the three datasets. We employ two new experts to perform another round of annotation for each dataset to establish human expert performance references. We ended up with weighted F-1 score of 49.1%, 77.7%, and 54.6% for CBTCD, CBT-PC, and CBT-FC, respectively. Despite implementing cross-verification step to filter out low-quality data, the results suggest that these tasks inherently involve degree of subjectivity."

The patient speech in each exercise starts with an emotion label indicating the patients emotional status. CBT competence as whole, beyond the specific tasks in levels and II. In real practice, we must proceed with caution, using such applications to assist therapists rather than interacting directly with patients without supervision. Nonetheless, first and foremost, it is crucial to understand the LLMs capability in providing effective responses. Collecting sufficient amount of real CBT session data is difficult due to privacy constraints. Taking the suggestions from professors specialized in CBT education (our co-authors), we propose using Deliberate Practice (Boswell and Constantino, 2022) as our level III task, CBT-DP. This methodology is traditionally used to assess graduate students proficiency in CBT. Unlike simulated scenarios such as role-playing, deliberate practice involves structured set of exercises focusing on responding to typical patient dialogue in CBT sessions. These exercises are divided into ten categories, such as Working With Cognitions and Responding to Client Resistance, addressing key aspects and challenges of conducting CBT. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of critical and difficult situations likely to arise in real therapy. Generating high-quality responses to patient speech in CBT-DP can serve as an effective proxy for evaluating real-world CBT session efficacy. Each category of CBT-DP contains approximately 15 exercises across three difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. We use the 156 exercises outlined in (Boswell and Constantino, 2022) as CBT-DP, where the authors provide one reference response for each exercise. Table 4 shows some example exercises with reference responses. Check Appendix for all categories and statistics of all exercises. For model evaluations, we frame CBT-DP as generation task. The patients speech in each exercise serves as the input, and the model is expected to generate an appropriate response. We work with our co-authors (professors in social work) to propose set of evaluation criteria, four fine-grained criteria for each category (Appendix A). As suggested by our co-authors, while Boswell and Constantino (2022) provide set of reference responses, these should not be treated as the sole gold standard. Consequently, matchingbased automatic evaluation metrics may not provide an accurate measure for this task. Therefore, we employ experts to conduct pairwise comparisons between the model generation and reference response under each criterion."

            "content": "Table 5 shows the performance of the LLMs. We report accuracy for CBT-QA and weighted precision, recall, and F1 score for the other three datasets. Here are the findings: Large LLMs are better at answering CBT knowledge questions. Large models could achieve higher accuracies on CBT-QA than small models. This could be attributed to larger models storing more knowledge. However, Gemma-2-9B has similar model size as Llama-3.1-8B and Mistralv0.3-7B and it surpasses these two by significant margin, even comparable to Llama3.1-70B. This may be caused by the distribution difference of the data used for training. Simply making the models larger could not enhance their understanding ability of the cognitive model. Mistral-v0.3-7B and Llama-3.1-7B these two small models get the best F1 scores on CBT-CD and CBT-PC, outperforming models of large sizes. This gives us insight that when increasing the model size to pursue better general capabilities like reasoning, the expertise of mental health care should also receive attention. Current LLMs struggle with detecting finegrained cognitive disorders or core beliefs. CBTCD and CBT-FC are very challenging for current LLMs. The models generally perform poorly on these two datasets which are very difficult even for professional therapists. Enhancing these abilities of LLMs could make the therapy process more efficient and accurate, and our datasets serve as valuable resources to propel potential advances. To delve further, we examine the accuracies for questions of different knowledge types in CBT-QA and detailed F1 scores on labels in CBT-CD, CBTPC, and CBT-FC. The results for two fine-grained classification tasks, CBT-CD and CBT-FC, are shown in Figure 17. We could see that for CBTQA, questions of basic CBT knowledge and concepts and others are easier to answer than questions of case studies and practical CBT knowledge. This could be the reason that questions of case studies and practical CBT knowledge require more understanding of how to use the corresponding knowledge, not just reciting them. For CBT-CD, the models all struggle to identify mental filter, manification, and overgeneralization disorders. And large models are not consistently outperforming small 7The results for CBT-QA and CBT-PC are shown in Appendix for space limit. models. For all-or-nothing thinking disorder, two small models have the best F1 scores. And for emotional reasoning disorder, GPT-4o and Llama3.170B have the best performance while Llama3.1405B even falls behind Llama3.1-7B. For CBT-PC, small models are better for helpless core belief, and large models take the lead for worthless. For unlovable belief, their performance is not much different. For CBT-FC, models are struggling with detecting am needy core belief. We go through the prediction of Llama-3.1-405B on the two fine-grained classification datasets and present some typical ones in Appendix G. The main reasons for wrong prediction include: 1) the model is not sensitive to the indicators of cognitive disorders or core beliefs, such as \"People do think Im...\" of overgeneralization disorder or \"There is nothing enjoyable in my life\" of dont deserve to live core belief; 2) The model focuses on several disorders or beliefs while neglecting the others; and 3) The model makes decision without sufficient supporting conditions. For example, determining the personalization disorder can be divided into one attributing the negative behavior to some person and this person should be himself; one of the cases in CBT-FC only meets the first but is judged as personalization by the model."

Labeling is done for each criterion defined, as well as an overall preference. We map the results to scale from -2 to 2, where +2 indicates strong preference for model-generated response. The full annotation consists of 468 pairwise comparisons across all models, with each instance requiring approximately 3 minutes for the expert to finish. Given the experts rate of $60 per hour, the annotation process takes around 24 hours to complete, resulting in significant cost. We first have our expert co-author annotate sample and write explanations of scoring. Then, we hired another expert to finish the annotation of all data following the guidance of our co-author (Appendix for our annotation interface)."

            "title": "5.3 Overall Result and Analysis",
            "content": "Here we first report the overall pairwise comparison results between each LLM vs. reference on 10 exercise categories in Table 6. Notably, the average results show that all three LLMs still lag behind humans by significant margin, with Llama-3.1-405B achieving the best result while GPT-4o is the worst. Moreover, Llama-3.1-8B and GPT-4o never surpass human-written references in every single class of exercise, while Llama-3.1-405B shows some superior results in half of the exercise categories. Further insights reveal that Llama-3.1-405B is better because it keeps engaging the client and ask7 Statement [Frustrated] know said would go to the event and start conversation with new people, but only managed to say hello to one person. Llama-3.1-405B It sounds like youre feeling disappointed with yourself for not meeting your own expectations. Can we take closer look at what held you back from starting more conversations? Was it anxiety, fear of rejection, or something else? Lets break it down and identify some smaller, achievable steps for next time. Human Reference It seems like you might be bit disappointed by this, but see this as significant progress. It was big accomplishment to show up to the event in the first place and then say hello to someone you dont know. Lets talk about what that was like. Table 7: Beginner exercise example: comparison between Llama-3.1-405B and human reference responses. The former is more structured, while the latter provides more emotional support. ing pertinent questions to guide them, but GPT-4o tends to correct the clients statement and keeps using professional CBT terminology to challenge the client. And Llama-3.1-8B lies in the middle. Although this might be improved by adding additional limits in the prompt, we believe the current prompt starting with \"you are professional therapist using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in session with client.\" should already inform the model about its role. The complete prompt can be found in Table 22. We also draw the win-tie-loss figure in Appendix F. Next, we discuss the overall score categorized by difficulty level in Figure 2. Surprisingly, we find that the models generally perform better when the difficulty level increases. Using Llama-3.1405B as an example, we observe that the models responses tend to be structured and rigid, often following pattern such as repeating the clients statement, questioning reasons, and proposing possibilities. In contrast, human reference responses are more effective in affirming the patients feelings and thoughts, and providing guidance from the patients perspective with high degree of empathy and flexibility, thereby establishing trust and rapport. At the beginner level, tasks tend to be logically simpler and more empathy-focused; consequently, model-generated answers are rated lower, as shown in Table 7. Figure 2: The overall pairwise comparison of different models vs. reference across difficulty level. In addition, Table 8 shows the models scores across 4 different criteria (C1-4) for exercises 2 8 #Exe. Metric Model Results Llama-3.1-405B Llama-3.1-8B GPT-4o 2 C2 C3 C4 0.34 0.06 -0. 0.56 -0.25 0.13 -0.13 0.13 0. -0.25 -0.63 0.81 Table 8: Results breakdown of 4 criteria on questions from exercise 2, reported with the average score. (full results for all exercises in Appendix E). Apart from the overall rating, these criteria give finegrained insights into the models performance. We saw mixed results from the evaluation of exercise 2 (Establishing Goals). For example, in the comparison in appendix Table 24, criteria 1 is Suggest CBT-consistent goals and tasks that align with an individualized CBT case formulation and criteria 4 is Emphasize concrete, actionable, and measurable goals. The human reference is much better in Criteria 1 and slightly worse in Criteria 4. Indeed, the model provides concrete and actionable suggestions (aligns with criteria 4) while the reference focuses on CBT case formulation (aligns with criteria 1). However, for exercise 10 (Responding to Client Resistance), all criteria witness negative results on all models (see Appendix E), consistent with the overall rating. The reason can be summarized as the models tend to dismiss the clients experience and challenge their resistance rather than being responsive to patient needs as human therapists. We show two such examples in appendix Table 25 and 26, clearly showing that the model tends to challenge the client while humans always respect clients autonomy."

            "content": "In this paper, we propose new benchmark, CBTBENCH, to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of assisting CBT with LLMs. CBT-BENCH contains three levels of tasks ranging from basic CBT knowledge acquisition to therapeutic response generation, totaling five new datasets constructed by domain experts. We experiment with representative LLMs and the results show that models achieve comparable or even better cognitive understanding ability, especially in QA tasks, but still lag behind humans in most generation tasks. We hope our new benchmark provides meaningful testbed for future research in this area."

            "title": "7 Limitations",
            "content": "In this work, we propose set of novel tasks aimed at addressing key stages of CBT where LLMs could potentially assist professionals. We collaborated closely with domain experts to select tasks that are both important and challenging, and that are well-suited for AI enhancement. However, annotating datasets in highly specialized fields like mental health is very costly, which has limited the size of our datasets and constrained our ability to scale to additional tasks. There may be other stages in CBT that could also benefit from AI assistance, which we leave for future research. Additionally, for the level III task, we used deliberate practice as an effective proxy to evaluate performance, given the difficulty of acquiring real CBT session data due to privacy concerns. Bridging this gap by approximating real CBT sessions, while respecting ethical and privacy constraints, remains an important direction for future work."

For all the data annotation and evaluation, we work with our co-authors (clinical psychologists, professors, and social workers) and hire experts from UpWork8. Experts are defined as those with graduate degree in clinical psychology, social work, or other related majors and have received at least 5 hours of CBT training. We hired total of 8 US-based experts, each at an hourly rate of $60. For some experts, we agreed on fixed payment based on an estimated completion time, calculated using the same hourly rate. Informed Consent. All experts hired were 18 or older and provided informed consent (Check Appendix for the consent forms). We did not assess any clinical outcomes. All data collected from the experts were de-identified and consented to be released for research purposes. 8www.upwork.com System and Data Usages. In this work, our primary goal is to systematically evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in assisting Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in order to provide insights for the future development of AIbased tools to support psychotherapy professionals. All data and systems developed in this work are intended exclusively for academic research purposes. They should not be used as real applications. We recognize the importance of human expertise and judgment in therapeutic settings and affirm that AI should be used to augment, not substitute, the essential role of trained professionals. Future developments of AI-based systems should not be used directly to interact with real patients without the supervision of professionals. We strongly advocate for rigorous ethical oversight in the deployment of AI-based systems in sensitive areas like mental health. Furthermore, all data used in this study were either publicly available or collected with full transparency and consent, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of individuals involved. All data collected from the experts were de-identified and consented to be released for research purposes."

People do think Im loser or that Im ugly. at least wear makeup so they cant see how ugly am, and if avoid people altogether, then they wont know how much of loser am or how boring am. dont like who am, and whatever people think of me is probably way worse than think it is. overgeneralization; emotional reasoning; mind reading Table 15: Examples from CBT-CD (Cognitive Distortion Classification). 18 Figure 3: An example cognitive model from (Beck, 2020)."

We have deep conversations about various topics, share laughs, and seem to have strong connection. However, every few months, he suddenly becomes distant. The usual daily communication slows down, his tone becomes cold, and theres noticeable disconnect. After giving it some space and bringing it up gently, he admits to withdrawing and usually provides reason for his behavior, such as feeling disrespected or abandoned. We address the issues, talk about feelings and needs, and find better ways to communicate. He has therapist, and encourage him to work on these issues, but the cycle repeats. Thoughts: am not enough for him. Why do always get hurt like this. always get stuck in these endless cycles, and am unlovable. Situation: would move out, but dont have the money for that nor do have the job. Whenever get job, take too many sick days out because of the bruises and scarring on my face are hard to hide.

It doesnt feel faithful. But dont know if even have the right to feel the way do about it after all, thats pretty much how our relationship started. Am even allowed to be upset? Im the one that changed, so it feels like its my fault. shouldnt be blaming him. He tried to get me involved, but when said wasnt into it, he didnt push, he just continued on doing what made him happy.

Llama-3.1-8B Human Reference Lets break that down. It sounds like youre feeling frustrated with your partner. Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing you distress in your relationship? What are some specific issues or behaviors that youd like to work on or change? Id like to hear more details about that. If relationship issues are most concerning to you, we can focus our work on that area. In our individual work together, well need to focus on things that you can change. Part of our session today can be brainstorming what some of those things might be.

Arent catastrophes reserved for wars and natural disasters? So, no, dont think catastrophize. Please dont ask again. understand your frustration, and its valid to feel that way when we challenge your thoughts. However, catastrophizing isnt limited to wars and natural disasters; its thought pattern where we exaggerate the consequences of situation, making it seem more severe or overwhelming than it actually is. Can we explore what makes you uncomfortable about this concept, and how it relates to your current concerns? It seems like my words upset you, and totally get it. Here am using CBT term that assumed would be relevant you, when in fact its not. really should not have made that assumption, and Ill do better to check in.

[Defeated] You know, Ive felt lot better these past few weeks, and honestly wonder if its because stopped doing those exercises you gave me. mean, maybe writing down my thoughts and trying to relax is making me worse . . . maybe this is just who am, and this is the best that can feel, and just need to learn to live with that. It sounds like youre feeling quite discouraged right now. Its great that youve been feeling better, but its also important to consider if avoiding the exercises might have short-term relief but long-term consequences. Sometimes, initial resistance to new techniques is part of the process. Could we explore if there might be aspects of the exercises that could be adapted to better fit your needs? CBT works best with some trial and error, and finding what genuinely helps you long-term is our goal. can hear in your voice how painful it is to feel like this might be the best you can ever feel. And, it sounds like one of the major reasons youre feeling this way is that the exercises Ive given you may be making things worse instead of better. So, want to say that different strategies work for different people, and there are all kinds of strategies that we can try to help you get to where you would like to be. Can we discuss what that might look for you?

Score - - -1 -1 0 -1 Score - - 0 -1 -1 -1 26 Win-tie-loss Analysis In this section, we additionally provide the win-tie-loss results by difficulty level in Figure 5. For win-tieloss calculation, we consider results with positive scores such as scores 1 and 2 as win, negative scores such as -1, and -2 as loss, and score 0 as tie. It is clear that the model responses seldom win but usually tie with the reference, and the reference wins more often. This confirms that although the models can already provide useful CBT assistance compared with human experts, but still lag and need further improvements.

            "content": "28 Case Situation: My anxiety used to be worse couple of years ago, but now Im just paranoid. Im always thinking that people think Im loser, and wont leave the house without makeup, because am horrified about what other people think about me. Thoughts: Because my anxiety felt worse before, this must be normal level of anxiety and paranoia, so my conclusions make more sense. People do think Im loser or that Im ugly. at least wear makeup so they cant see how ugly am, and if avoid people altogether, then they wont know how much of loser am or how boring am. dont like who am, and whatever people think of me is probably way worse than think it is. Situation: Its all my fault most likely all do is constantly worry about everything. Thoughts: should be able to control others around me, and when cant, cope with it by worrying. If someone is making decisions disagree with, should worry. There is something wrong with me that cant control others. am doing everything wrong. Situation: have been recently dealing with weird behavior...I have also been getting angry over small issues that should have little effect on me. But lately, its been having huge effects on me...It may sound like Im brat... Thoughts: am confused about what is happening...I need an explanation for these changes to my mood...I feel out of control...I cannot control my behavior...my behavior and feelings are fused together...what Im feeling is wrong... Unrecognized Disorder Overgeneralization Should statements Mental filter Reason The model focuses on the clients fear of judgment and anxiety in social situations rather than recognizing the generalized, negative self-beliefs indicated by \"People do think Im loser or that Im ugly\". The model fail to focus on the clients statement \"I should be able to control others around me\", which is clear indicator of \"Should statements\" disorder. The client is experiencing the complexity of emotional distress, which may cause the feature of \"Mental filter\" being overlooked. Case Wrongly Recognized Disorder Reason Situation: have been with my girlfriend for 5 years and we have history of strong sexual intimacy connection. This has been getting worse over time. Thoughts: It is my girlfriends sex drive that is the problem. Personalization This client attributes the issue solely to his girlfriend rather than examining internal or relational factors. The models misidentification as personalization (taking excessive personal responsibility) could stem from misinterpreting the clients statements. Situation: am struggling at the moment and yet am aware that should be feeling good. Thoughts: What am feeling and going through is unacceptable and wrong. There is right and wrong way to go through this and am doing it the wrong way. All-or-nothing thinking The core issue lies more in selfjudgment and difficulty accepting emotional experiences, not binary thinking. The misidentification by the model could occur because both patterns involve rigid judgments. Situation: am finding younger girls sexually arousing. Thoughts: am worried about whether or not this will go away later in life, this is horrible, and even feel guilty constantly, cannot help it. magnification This patient is merely expressing reasonable concerns based on their current situation; it is rational and not an unjustified exaggeration. The misidentification by the model may caused by solely concentrating on the clients negative statements. Table 27: Error Cases of Cognitive Disorder Classification. (Llama-3.1-405B) 29 Case Situation: She is everything ever wanted in woman and am so happy to have her in my life. Unfortunately, am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. Thoughts: If Im not her first, she wont love me forever. She will leave me because Im not special to her. She is everything to me. If she leaves me, will be nothing. wont ever be able to find someone as amazing as she is. think shes lying to me about her virginity, which just means she is probably lying about her feelings for me, too, and its only matter of time before she realizes it and leaves me. Situation: met this guy month ago, and we hung out and kissed, but in front of his sister, he told me was too young for him and he only wanted to be friends. Now he supposedly has girl that he spends all his time with after work and he doesnt text me anymore. Thoughts: dont deserve love. There is something wrong with me. His new girl has something that dont; thats why he is spending time with her and not me. will be alone forever. will always be rejected by everyone care about. Nobody likes me. Situation: have recently recovered from cancer, gained weight, and lack confidence in myself. feel alone in my life. still work but that is all there is. My wife and get along but there is no emotional closeness between us. have no close friends. Thoughts: am loser. am failure. Something is wrong with me. My wife deserves better than me. My wife doesnt love me anymore because have gained weight. There is nothing enjoyable in my life, ever. There is absolutely nothing to look forward to. Me and my wife NEVER connect. am all alone. Nobody loves me. This will never get any better. There is nothing can do about it. The world is against me and its out of my hands. am waste of space. Maybe cancer should have killed me. Unrecognized Core Belief am needy Reason The model may have concentrated on the clients suspicions about the partners virginity and honesty, viewing the issue as insecurity or control, rather than emotional dependency. am needy The model may have interpreted the clients thoughts as purely low self-esteem or fear of rejection, rather than recognizing the underlying emotional need for constant validation. dont deserve to live The model might have missed the suicidal thoughts indicated by the statements like \"There is nothing enjoyable in my life\" and \"Maybe cancer should have killed me\". Case Wrongly Recognized Core Belief Reason Situation: For the past 3 months Ive been feeling really down, having mood swings, irritability have no reason to be and feel like Im going crazy and that cant talk to anybody about this because Im being overly dramatic. Thoughts: Something is wrong with me. am losing my mind. Nobody understands me. Everyone would reject me if they knew. Situation: When go to the store, believe that hear people talking about me in their heads, as though can hear their thoughts. Thoughts: am capable of hearing other peoples thoughts. People are talking to me in their heads. am telepathic. am certain of these things. Because hear voices, they must be coming from other people. am helpless am out of control Situation: have problem of automatically looking at things like shiny objects or body parts. dont have any bad intentions but people misunderstand me. Thoughts: This is something to be ashamed of. always do it. Something is wrong with me. cant stop looking at these things. People will reject me because of this habit. This habit is out of my control. am immoral The clients thought, Nobody understands me, suggests need for connection and validation, which the model might have missed by emphasizing helplessness. The clients thoughts reflect conviction (e.g., am telepathic) rather than fear, indicating belief in special abilities rather than being out of control. The model may not be very clear about the difference between the two. The client explicitly states they have no bad intentions, indicating the issue is about loss of control, not morality. The model may have neglected this information. Table 28: Error Cases of Fine-grained Core Belief Classification. (Llama-3.1-405B)"
