            "title": "1 Introduction",
            "content": "In the field of large language models (LLMs), race is going on between open and closed models, between models that are examinable, tunable, and free to use (Llama, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek) and models that are not (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok). In such race, particularly for domains where universal access is fundamental rightsuch as human healthcareit is advantageous and essential that open models match the pace of closed alternatives. As mechanism of reliability, accessibility, and oversight, which are fundamental safety requirements for disruptive technologies, LLMs have many possible benefits for healthcare: automating redundant tasks, reducing human training costs, and facilitating access to medical information. Open healthcare LLMs are necessary to guarantee that everyone can benefit from such advances while promoting higher standards of transparency and reliability in AI models. Todays most effective mechanism to build powerful healthcare LLMs is to finetune highly competitive pre-trained models. These models already possess strong foundation in general language processing and generation, allowing them to fine-tune and focus on tailoring their healthcare capabilities. The alternative, pre-training base model from scratch, would require the introduction of massive amounts of data outside of the healthcare field, increasing the cost to tens of millions of dollars. The finetuning approach is feasible and fruitful thanks to the release of open models. On the one hand, continuated pre-training performs the same autoregressive learning on large amounts of domain-specific data. On the other, instruct tuning or assistant adaptation trains the model through labelled Question-Answer pairs, tuning the model on how to respond to requests. This can be done in domain-specific or general-purpose data. Notice instruct tuning is often considered supervised fine-tuning (SFT) method since data used for training are curated pairs. third type of LLM tuning mechanism, which typically falls outside SFT, is model alignment, which drives the model towards producing preferable outputs with higher probability (e.g., RLHF, DPO). Finally, model merging is an ensemble technique that changes the internal weights of the model by combining those of different variants following set of heuristics. Also, outside of loss-based learning, prompting strategies, sometimes called in-context learning, have evolved into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for boosting the performance of models during inference through contextualization and bias. The variety of options available in LLM training and deployment are illustrated in Figure 1. This work reviews previous attempts within the healthcare domain in Section 2 and their struggles to outperform generalist models. These insights are used to select and tune training strategy that is both cost-efficient and highly competitive in Section 3. Data and training details are discussed in Sections 4 and 5, while in-context learning deployment is described in Section 6. varied evaluation of the trained models is conducted in Section 7, using automated methods, human supervision and safety metrics. Finally, Section 8 summarises the main conclusions of this work. The artefacts released with this work comprise the Aloe Family of models1 and datasets2, freely distributed with an open license. In detail, the recipe shown in 1https://huggingface.co/collections/HPAI-BSC/healthcare-llms-aloe-family-6701b6a777f7e874a2123363 2https://huggingface.co/collections/HPAI-BSC/aloe-beta-datasets-672374294ed56f43dc302499 Figure 3 is used to produce four models (7B, 8B, 70B and 72B) using two different pre-trained sources (Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5). These are domain-specific (healthcare specialists), instruct-tuned (useful assistants) and aligned with human preferences (safe to use). All datasets used for training, including those curated and expanded, are shared for the community to use. Aloe Beta models are released with healthcare-specific risk assessment for safe deployment."

            "content": "Healthcare LLMs have seen significant advancements in the last few years. Private models claim top performance in benchmarks using advanced prompt strategies (e.g., GPT-4 with Medprompt [1] and MedPalm-2 [2]). These models were recently joined by Med-Gemini [3], built on top of Gemini 1.0 and 1.5 models, which introduces multimodal and web search functionalities. Unfortunately, all these private options remain inaccessible to the broader research community, creating significant gap in developing and evaluating open healthcare LLMs. In parallel, open models for healthcare have made substantial progress, using wide range of architectures and strategies for improving performance in medical domains. MedAlpaca [4], released in April 2023, is based on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B and instructtuned on dataset containing 150,000 question-answer (QA) pairs. PMC-LLaMA [5], introduced in May 2023, fine-tunes LLaMA-2 through continuous pre-training on mix of books and papers, followed by instruct tuning on QA pairs. Similarly, Meditron, launched in November 2023, leverages continuous pre-training and fine-tuning on LLaMA-2 using substantial dataset of medical papers, abstracts, and guidelines (48 billion tokens). Meditron [6] includes 7B and 70B version and is tailored to specific benchmarks through targeted instruct tuning. The landscape expanded in 2024 with MMed-LLM-2 [7], 7B model released in February 2024 trained on InternLM-2 using medical data from multilingual datasets and textbooks (25 billion tokens). MMedLLM-2 excels in multilingual medical QA tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance for languages such as Japanese and Chinese in its custom benchmark, MMedBench. BioMistral [8], introduced the same month, focuses on continuous pre-training of medical papers on top of the instruct-tuned Mistral-7B. OpenBioLLM [9] launched in April was designed specifically for the biomedical domain. Although its multiple-choice QA performance is reportedly strong, the training data and technical report remain undisclosed. In the same month, Aloe Alpha [10] was introduced as the first iteration of the Aloe family, including techniques like merging and red teaming. Built on Mistral and LLaMA-3, Aloe Alpha leveraged public datasets enhanced with synthetic Chain of Thought (CoT) data and applied Direct Preference Optimization for alignment. This model set new standard for ethical performance among open healthcare LLMs, with evaluations covering bias, toxicity, and risk, and achieved state-of-the-art performance for 7B open models. Shortly after, Ultramedical [11] was released, together with suite of high-quality manual and synthetic biomedical datasets called UltraMedical Collections. These datasets, featuring preference annotations across various advanced LLMs, are used to fine-tune specialized medical models based on LLaMA-3, achieving remarkable results on diverse medical benchmarks. In August, Med42-v2 [12], built 4 on LLaMA-3, employed two-stage training process, instruction fine-tuning and preference alignment, to address clinical queries effectively. Finally, by December 2024, HuatuoGPT-o1 [13] introduced novel reasoning-focused training recipe, using 40,000 verifiable medical problems to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities in underexplored domains like medicine. Addressing risks and ethical considerations of healthcare LLMs has also gained some attention. While only few works have explicitly reviewed the potential harms and risks of this technology in such sensitive domain [1416], recent comprehensive benchmarking effort [17] highlights the challenges of bias, toxicity, sycophancy, and hallucinations in medical applications. Tackling these issues remains imperative as open healthcare LLMs continue to evolve and strive for parity with private models. Many healthcare LLMs have been released recently, but only fraction of them include full data and training details, hampering the reproducibility and accessibility of the related works. Similarly, open models that do not include safety alignment phase are limited in their application domains. That being said, the main competitor of healthcare fine-tunes are their respective base models, which are often highly reliable for healthcare tasks without requiring any domain adaptation. The instruct versions released by the original authors of the base models will be used as baseline later in this work."

That is both domain adaptation and instruct tuning. This step is essential to adapting the model to the intricacies of the healthcare domain. 2. Model Merging: In the subsequent phase (Step 3, Figure 2), we employ model merging techniques (5.2) to integrate the learned representations of models with [8, 19] analogous architectures. This process, which combines parameter sets rather than adding parameters, aims to leverage the strengths of diverse models, mitigating individual model biases and increasing robustness. 3. Model Alignment: Finally, (Step 4, Figure 2), Model Alignment, detailed in 5.3, is used to enhance model safety and reliability. This involves training the model to produce responses that are fair, accurate, and safe for use in healthcare settings, explicitly addressing risks related to bias, toxicity, and other harms."

While these sources offer high fidelity, their volume is inherently limited. In total, this accounts for 1.2M instructions. Synthetically Enhanced Medical Datasets: To overcome the volume limitations of the human-curated medical data, we augment the dataset with data extended via LLMs. Careful design and oversight are implemented to guarantee the quality of the generated data, with total of 420K instructions.

            "title": "4.1.1 Data Pre-processing",
            "content": "Fig. 4 Pipeline of the data processing for SFT All data used for SFT is processed through sequence of quality-improving steps, as summarised in Figure 4. The cleaning step includes the removal of URLs, emails, special characters, and unnecessary spaces, as well as standardising capitalisation and punctuation. Each dataset is analysed individually to identify and fix specific formatting issues (e.g., errors in line break codification). Samples missing the question or the answer are also discarded. Some additional QA pairs were also removed based on handcrafted list of irrelevant questions and answers. This step also fixes several identified redundant and noisy responses from multi-choice QA pairs. Examples and further details are provided in Appendix B. After cleaning, deduplication removes redundant samples. This is done using the Local-Sensitivity Hashing (LSH) Minhash technique [21], as implemented in Datatrove [22]. For QA samples, the question and answer are first concatenated and then compared with the rest of pairs using the default threshold (i.e., 0.72). For multiturn conversations, the dialogues are concatenated, adding the author of the turn in each dialogue. The threshold for this second data set is tuned to 0.77 to reduce false positives. To prevent data leaks from validation and test samples into the training split, we perform decontamination. We use an LLM-based method, which has shown better 11 results than n-gram and embedding similarity-based approaches [23]. For that purpose, we use the Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B model as the judge, removing all instructions that it flags. To improve the overall quality of the training dataset while maintaining as much volume as possible, filtering is applied, looking for and discarding the least informative of the samples. The DEITA [24] technique is used, which assigns complexity and quality score to each sample. Samples for which the DEITA pipeline cannot provide quality or complexity scores are discarded. We also eliminate the bottom 10% of samples when sorted by evol score, which is product of the quality and complexity score. See Appendix for more details on this process, including justification for the 10% threshold. The final step in the data pre-processing pipeline is templating, process designed to introduce variance into training samples, thereby enhancing dataset diversity and improving the models ability to handle wide range of queries. This approach builds on insights from prior research, such as Orca [25], highlighting the critical role of diverse, high-quality prompts in ineffective training data. Templating is applied to all datasets lacking specific prompt templates. For the sixteen identified sub-tasks within these datasets, we manually create between five and ten templates per task, resulting in 110 distinct templates in total. This ensures robust representation of task-specific variations. Details about the tasks and their corresponding templates are provided in Appendix B. Additionally, we adopt the Alpaca format for single-turn QA tasks and the ShareGPT format for multi-turn conversations, ensuring compatibility with different interaction styles and scenarios."

            "content": "Synthetic data generation has been proven to be an effective way of scaling training and evaluation [26] data for LLMs for diverse domains [27], such as math [28] and code [29]. Current open models offer great alternative to labour-intensive manual data curation processes. They are easier to fit in more affordable GPUs, making data generation more scalable. The generation of synthetic data poses new challenges, such as factuality and inherent model biases [30], impacting the dataset quality. For this reason, recent approaches use real medical data as base to prompt and enhance it for particular medical task. [31] employs ChatGPT to generate more than 10K examples based on several biomedical Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction datasets as seed, significantly improving the F1 score in both tasks. [32] uses CoT style synthetic data generation strategy based on LLaMA-65B to detect Alzheimers Disease (AD)-related signs and symptoms from electronic health records (EHRs). Lastly, GatorTron [33] generated 20 billion words of synthetic text to train NLP models, which outperform models trained using real-world clinical text. This work uses synthetic data to enhance the most frequent data source in the healthcare domain: multiple-choice question-answer tests. Through curated prompts (see Figure 5), simple A,B,C,D responses are transformed into long-form answers following chain-of-thought schema. Adding the correct answer to the prompt and using top-quality LLMs (in this case, LlaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct) boosts the factuality and 12 validity of the created content. total of 419,938 samples are synthetically extended, primarily derived from multiple-choice benchmark training sets. The specific datasets utilised are: PubMedQA [34]: question-answering dataset derived from PubMed abstracts. Each sample consists of context text, real-world question, and outputs comprising both binary answer (yes or no) and long-form answer derived from the abstracts conclusion. We utilised the training set of the PubMedQA dataset, specifically the PubMedQA-A (artificial) subset. We reformulated the QA pairs by generating CoT answers to enhance the dataset quality. Specifically, we provided the model with the context, question, long-form answer, and binary answer, instructing it to produce an improved response following structured prompts (see Figure B4 in the Appendix B) and adding three few-shot examples. Using this method with LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we generated 210,257 high-quality QA pairs. MedQA [35]: This dataset consists of multiple-choice question-answer (MCQA) pairs sourced from medical board exams in the United States, Mainland China, and Taiwan. While the dataset spans three languages (English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese), we utilised only the English training set. Using this set, we generated 10,178 synthetic CoT answers using the prompt of Figure 5. real and complete example can be seen in Figure B3 of the Appendix B. We incorporated responses from the MMedBench dataset [36] as foundation to facilitate the generation process. For each question, we prompted the model to (1) generate summary of the question and relevant information, (2) provide individual explanations for each possible answer choice, and (3) create final explanation along with the final choice decision. Throughout this process, the model was guided and supported by the initial responses from MMedBench. MedMCQA: Comprises over 194,000 multiple-choice questions from medical entrance exams, covering 2,400 healthcare topics across 21 medical subjects. Each question includes prompt, correct answer, and possible options, requiring models to exhibit deep language understanding and reasoning abilities. In addition, the training set includes short explanation of the answer. We utilized the training set to generate 182,736 synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) answers, following the methodology and prompts applied to the MedQA dataset. HeadQA [37]: This dataset consists of multiple-choice questions from Spanish healthcare specialization exams conducted between 2013 and 2017. The original Spanish dataset was translated into English using the Google API, crucial step that enhances the datasets accessibility and usability for wider audience. The translated version was then evaluated for adequacy and fluency by bilingual and native speakers. We used the English-translated version to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for all 6,600 questions, following the prompt in Figure 5, with complete data generation example provided in the Appendix B. Since this dataset lacks supporting explanations for answer generation, we provided the correct answers to ensure the models response aligns with the correct one. If mismatch occurs, we regenerate the answer until it is correct. 13 Fig. 5 Exact prompts used to generate the synthetic data. All the prompts are followed by 3 fewshot examples.

Then, we followed the same method and prompt as in the HeadQA dataset. PolyMed [38]: comprehensive resource containing medical knowledge graphs and diagnostic case data. For each diagnostic case, we used Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct to generate question-answer pairs. The questions were crafted based on patient information, medical background, and symptom data, while the answers included both the final diagnosis and the detailed reasoning process leading to that conclusion.

By training the model on carefully curated, labeled healthcare data, the learning process is guided toward producing accurate and context-sensitive responses. This structured approach drives alignment towards the requirements of healthcare tasks, while avoiding the resource-heavy demands of continued pretraining. For these reasons, SFT is used as the core method for adapting Aloe Beta, balancing efficiency with domain-specific expertise and reliability. As introduced in 3.2, Aloe Beta is built on Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 models. Specifically, we trained Metas 8B and 70B parameter models, as well as Alibabas 7B and 72B parameter models using an SFT approach. This process utilized the dataset described in Section 4.1 and the Axolotl5 training framework. All model versions were trained for four epochs with sequence length of 16k, employing the Adam torch optimizer. For the Llama models, we used learning rate of 2 105, while for the Qwen models, learning rate of 1 105 was applied. cosine scheduler with 100step warm-up was consistently employed across all models. The total batch size was set to 128 for all versions, except for Qwen 2.5-72B, where batch size of 192 was used.

This process, known as model merging or model soup, maintains the same model size (i.e., does not add new parameters) while combining the sets of parameters for more robust outcome. In the case of the Aloe Family models, we consider merging as means to exploit the highly competitive instruct version made available by the authors of the base models used. Notice that, while the Aloe Beta models are fine-tuned on top of base Llama 3.1 to produce an instruct model, Meta also released their own Llama 3.1 instruct (same for Qwen). These are therefore perfect candidates for model merging with their respective Aloe versions. The purpose of this merge is to bring together the healthcare knowledge acquired during the SFT phase described in this work, with the instruction following capabilities in general domains found in the official instruct models. Among the existing merging methods, several are considered (e.g., linear [49], TIES [50], DARE-TIES [51], task arithmetic [52], model stock [53], and model breadcumbs [54]). Following our own benchmarks, and existing results [8, 19], DARE-TIES is finally selected. This method, described in [51] and [55], drops the portion of parameters with the least magnitude, rescales the rest to account for the change, and merges parameters with consistent signs. This process is conducted using the Mergekit library [56]."

            "title": "5.3 Model Alignment",
            "content": "To steer model outputs towards human preferences, specific training stage known as Model Alignment (MA) is conducted. This is key step, as it induces behaviour in the model that humans find safe and satisfactory. The most straightforward approach to MA is fine-tuning high-quality human responses across wide variety of tasks using reinforcement learning (RL), for example, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [57]. However, RLHF is expensive and often unstable. Recent approaches based on supervised learning, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [58], let go of the explicit reward model in RLHF and instead directly optimize the LLMs towards human preferences without RL. In detail, DPO uses theoretical model to define preference loss as function of the policy, with highly competitive results [59]. As detailed in 4.2 four different data sources are used for guiding model responses: medical preference data, general preference data, safety datasets, and customized and extensive red teaming dataset. The last one is specially introduced to prevent malicious attempts at producing dangerous or toxic content (i.e., jailbreaking) with the Aloe Family models and is thus considered the most critical. To maximize the efficacy and impact of this last effort, the MA is conducted in two stages. In the first stage, medical preference, general preference, and safety are combined. In the last stage, DPO is conducted exclusively on the customized red teaming dataset. Model Alignment was performed with the OpenRLHF [60] library, on top of the merged model.

The resulting model was then trained for another epoch on the second chunk, and this process was repeated iteratively until all five chunks were processed, completing five training steps. This chunk-based iterative approach was chosen to balance computational efficiency with effective model optimization. By limiting the training to one epoch per chunk, we aimed to prevent overfitting while ensuring that the model progressively incorporated diverse examples from the dataset. Other strategies were explored, such as training on the full dataset for multiple epochs, using different chunk sizes, and leveraging Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) [61]. However, these alternatives either led to overfitting, failed to generalize across datasets, or resulted in suboptimal performance metrics compared to the chunkbased iterative approach. In this stage, we used sequence length of 4,096 tokens, which exceeds the length of all instructions in the dataset, ensuring that no samples were pruned. The learning rate was set to 2107, with the beta parameter configured to 0.1. In the second stage, training was performed over single epoch using the custom red-teaming dataset. For this stage, the learning rate was further reduced to 1107. Detailed hyperparameters and training configurations for both stages can be found in Table 5 and Table 6, corresponding to the first and second MA stages, respectively.

The MareNostrum 5 ACC accelerated block comprises 1,120 nodes, each node composed of 2 Intel Xeon Sapphire Rapids processors and 4 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs with 64GB of VRAM memory. While the SFT stage uses the Axolotl fine-tuning library6, and the MA uses OpenRLHF7, both include the DeepSpeed optimization library8 for distributed training using the Zero-3 parallelism across multiple nodes. Computational requirements vary across model sizes. For the SFT stage, the smaller models (7B and 8B versions) required 8 nodes, equivalent to 32 GPUs. The 70B model necessitated an increase to 16 nodes (64 GPUs), while the largest model of 72B parameters required 24 nodes (96 GPUs). The MA phase for the 7B and 8B models utilized 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs (4 nodes) with total batch size of 128 and gradient accumulation steps of 8. The larger 70B and 72B models required 100 GPUs (25 nodes) with micro-batch size of 1 for the MA stage. Model merging operations were conducted on single node, with different approaches based on model size. The smaller models (7B/8B) were processed using single GPU, while the larger models (70B/72B) required CPU-only processing. This CPU-only approach was necessary as the memory requirements for merging exceeded single GPU capacity, while CPU memory allowed for efficient weight merging operations. Finally, all the evaluations, including the In-context learning evaluation, were performed on single-node setup. To assess the footprint of this work, the energy consumption of the training process is tracked. The power consumed in kW was summed, and converted to estimated greenhouse gas emissions in Kg of CO2 using the ratio of CO2 emissions from public electricity production provided by the European Environment Agency for Spain in 2023 (158 g/kWh)9. Using this information, we calculated the carbon footprint of the model trainings, expressed in kilograms of CO2. The estimated overall carbon footprint reached total of 1,772.34 kilograms of CO2, which is equivalent to 9 million Google searches or 10 one-way economy flights from Zurich to London10.

            "content": "In-Context learning (ICL) has emerged as technique to enhance the performance of LLMs, beyond model learning methodologies which rely on updating model parameters. In essence, ICL complements the input of the model, the context around which the model makes its predictions, to boost the probabilities of getting correct outputs. The most fundamental of ICL methods seek to optimize the prompt (i.e., the instructions or requests given to the model). This can be done without external sources of information and even without human intervention; chain-of-thought (CoT) for example uses the model output to guide itself through series of incremental steps (i.e., using the prefix Lets think step-by-step [62]). While CoT is most useful in zero-shot setup, where the model input contains no examples of the desired output, it can also be applied in few-shot learning scenario. In this case, small number of input-output pairs are added to the prompt as examples to mimic, biasing the model towards the desired responses. One last example of self-contained ICL method is self-consistency, which combines the output produced by multiple runs of the same model to distill one final answer. When employed in conjunction with other prompt engineering techniques, self-consistency can significantly improve the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs across various tasks and domains, including healthcare [6]. External sources of information are used to boost ICL methods, adding relevant segments to enrich the prompt. That is known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and it typically includes an external database from which text samples are extracted and added to the prompt, based on their relevance for given query. Relevance is generally measured as the distance between the vector representation of the query and sample, after using an embedding model to encode them. An example of such system is Medprompt [1], designed and tested for the healthcare domain. It includes CoT few-shot examples, self-consistency, and choice shuffling. In this study, we integrate Aloe Family models with MedPrompt to evaluate the upper-performance limits of the generated models. The strategy and configuration used for Medprompt follows [63], represented in Figure 7 employing twenty iterations with self-consistency and choice shuffling, and including five examples for few-shot learning. The examples are retrieved from custom database, created using the training sets of MedMCQA and MedQA datasets. The resulting database comprises 192,084 examples generated with Llama-3.1-70BInstruct. For each example, the model was instructed to first summarize the topic of the question, analyze each possible option individually, and then provide detailed decision following Chain of Thought approach. This methodology enables complex reasoning, facilitating more accurate and explainable answer generation. The dataset has been make public in HuggingFace13. For example retrieval, SFR-Embedding-Mistral is employed, without any re-ranker model.

            "content": "The Aloe Family models are trained to be versatile and capable in the wide domain of healthcare. To assess such models coherently, evaluation must be equally varied. However, even when using large set of benchmarking tasks, drawing reliable conclusions remains challenging due to the current limitations of LLM evaluation [64, 65]. Indeed, the question on how to assess generalist capabilities remain an open problem. In the field of healthcare, LLMs are most commonly benchmarked using popular set of Multiple-choice question-answering datasets. MCQA provides exact matching metrics (e.g., accuracy from Answer with A, B, or D.) that can be reliably compared and easily interpreted by humans. But this simplicity also entails weakness, as the probability of producing one single output token (A, B, or D) is hardly representative of the free discourse capacity needed to perform well at broad range of medical tasks (e.g., summarization). At the same time, certain MCQA datasets (i.e., MedQA, PubMedQA, MedMCQA, HeadQA, MMLU, etc.) have been used in the literature for model selection purposes [4], and may show signs of saturation. To prevent 14https://github.com/HPAI-BSC/prompt engine 21 the risk of contamination, we add recent and novel MCQA samples to our evaluation, corresponding to official medical exams from 2024 (CareQA [17]). The MCQA evaluation results are presented in 7.1. Open ended (OE) evaluation is complementary to MCQA. In OE, responses can be arbitrarily long and structured. While this is more realistic setup for the model to operate, the definition of correct answer and its measurement becomes uncertain. Some measures (i.e., ROUGE, BLEU) are based on n-grams [66, 67], tracking the overlap of consecutive sets of words with those found in reference answer (one of many possible ones). Others rate open answers by means of word perplexity, metric borrowed from information theory which measures how likely it is to sample the correct answer from the model distribution, i.e., the inverse geometric mean of wordlikelihoods for the ground truth under the model distribution [68]. Recent works have shown both approaches are uncorrelated [17], measuring different aspects of answer quality. Coherently, we observe both in 7.2. The third type of evaluation considered is based on human experts. Although limited in scale, this evaluation provides relevant insights, particularly when considering the potential use of healthcare LLMs as assistants and decision-support mechanisms for humans. The limitations in human evaluation lie in individual and collective biases. For example, humans are known to prefer longer explanations [69]. Furthermore, the population of experts used to evaluate the models is limited in size and variety, biased its assessment towards highly specific population. Human evaluation remains relevant, which is why significant effort is conducted, as presented in 7.3. To conclude the evaluation of the Aloe Family, and considering the relevance of model safety in healthcare, model safety assessment is implemented in 7.4. This includes study on how resilient models are to producing toxic or dangerous content even in the presence of malicious prompts designed to elicit such undesirable behaviours from LLMs. These four evaluation methods (MCQA, OE, Human and Safety) are conducted on the four models from Aloe Family, and also on their corresponding baselines (i.e., the instruct version trained by the authors of the base model used by Aloe Beta). In some cases, one additional model is also used as reference, Med42B, since this is similar to Aloe (healthcare fine-tune); it includes both small and big sizes and has its technical details reported."

These are reported by the authors of Medprompt [1] and MedPalm-2 [2]. boost over the instruct models is significant and consistent, with bigger gains for smaller models (+6 and +9) and smaller gains for bigger models (+3 and +4). Table 8 also shows results from closed healthcare models, reported by the authors of Medprompt [1] and MedPalm-2 [2]. While not entirely analogous, the performance gap between open and closed models seems minimal. When comparing models in MCQA, Aloe-Beta-72B matches or outperforms GPT-4 and MedPalm-2. When integrating RAG components, the performance reported for closed models slightly outperforms the one produced in this work."

In evaluating healthcare LLMs, assessing their performance across broad spectrum of tasks is essential to ensure that these models can address the complex requirements of clinical settings. This is an open-ended (OE) evaluation. This subsection focuses on evaluating tasks that require generating context-specific outputs instead of selecting answers from predefined set of limited options (i.e., MCQA). Notice the OE process remains an ongoing effort [17, 70, 71] since there is no standardised set of benchmarks that tests all the medical and clinical applications and tasks. 25 Clinical-note taking Open-ended medical questions Medical factuality ACI Bench MTS-Dialog Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct Llama3-Med42-8B Llama3.1-Aloe-Beta-8B Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct Qwen2.5-Aloe-Beta-7B Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct Llama3-Med42-70B Llama-3.1-Aloe-Beta-70B Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct Qwen2.5-Aloe-Beta-72B 14.19 8.42 13.94 15.25 13.35 11.44 7.80 12.69 15.12 10.15 120.13 141.88 138.35 188.60 134. 93.94 94.85 116.67 101.52 90.08 CareQA (open) MedDialog Raw Perplexity 573.72 445.40 495. 1733.92 1998.95 406.88 354.56 522.78 551.91 435.19 80.16 76.77 76.06 98.12 74.86 60.91 62.39 70. 66.40 54.11 MEDIQA2019 OLAPH 6.18 5.74 5.54 5.24 4.8 2.89 2.54 2. 2.12 1.90 6.93 6.70 6.53 7.63 7.45 6.11 7.19 6.37 6.34 5.93 Table 11 Perplexity scores across different tasks and benchmarks for various models (lower is better). The table shows the performance of Llama3.1 and Qwen2.5 along with their fine-tuned versions. Bold values indicate the best performance within each task, while bold and underlined values highlight the overall best results. Therefore, the benchmarks used for OE evaluations are extensive but not exhaustive. In detail, the set of tasks included are derived from the suite presented in [17]. Clinical note-taking: Generating notes based on conversations between healthcare providers and patients or other clinical interactions, using MTS-Dialog [72] and ACI-Bench [73]. Diagnosis and treatment recommendations: Providing clinical guidance based on patients condition, evaluated with the MedText16 dataset. Medical classification: Categorizing medical texts into specific categories, using two benchmarks: Medical Text for Classification [74] and Medical Transcriptions17. Medical factuality: Measuring the factual accuracy of medical responses, evaluated with the OLAPH dataset [75]. Open-ended medical questions: Responding to complex medical queries, with performance measured using CareQA Open, MedDialog Raw [76], and MEDIQA2019 [77]. Question entailment: Determining whether one question logically follows from another, using MedDialog Qsumm [76]. Relation extraction: Identifying and extracting relationships between entity pairs (e.g., gene/protein, disease, chemical), evaluated using the BioRED dataset [78]. Summarization: Condensing medical information into concise and coherent summaries, using the MIMIC-III dataset [79]. Results for all OE tasks are reported in Table 10 (n-gram metrics) and 11 (perplexity metrics). The former results are inconsistent, showing high variance across models. All reported models are highly competitive in one or more benchmarks. 16https://huggingface.co/datasets/BI55/MedText 17https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions 26 Remarkably, small models (7B and 8B) are close in performance to large models and, at times, even outperform them (e.g., MTS-Dialog, MEDIQA2019). All in all, these results indicate the Aloe training strategy has not significantly modified the models capacity to produce coherent dialogue and remains competitive on all tasks considered. These highly variable results are also influenced by the used metrics (ROUGE1), which measure the overlap between generated and reference texts. Similar results were observed with ROUGE2 and ROUGEL, which measure bigram and longest-gram overlap, respectively. While ROUGE1 is an efficient metric for assessing the relevance and coverage of generated content, it focuses on lexical similarity without accounting for semantic meaning or coherence. Perplexity results, which measure the predictive strength of the models, are slightly more consistent. In Table 11, larger models generally outperform smaller ones, and fine-tuned configurations (e.g., Med42 and Aloe) improve performance over their corresponding baselines, underscoring the importance of task-specific training. According to this metric, and in agreement with the results in MCQA evaluation, Qwen2.5-AloeBeta-72B is the best performing open model examined inside and outside of the Aloe Family."

            "title": "7.3 Human Evaluation",
            "content": "To assess the quality of the models responses according to human expertise, we conduct an evaluation with medical experts. Given the cost in human hours of such effort, this evaluation is limited to comparing the larger models in the Aloe Family (the bigger ones) with the official Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 instruct versions. The study is designed as binary choice in which humans evaluate pairs of models. After being presented with question, and two possible answers for it (as produced by two hidden models) the evaluator must specify which one they prefer. The questions used in this evaluation were gathered from Reddit, specifically the HealthAdvice subreddit18. This choice was made for three main reasons. First, the answers to these questions are not highly specialised, meaning that most doctors could evaluate the quality of answers regardless of the field of medicine they work on. Second, it represents real use case: people currently seek medical advice on Reddit, and in the future, they may turn to LLMs for similar guidance; the way in which questions are written is representative of what LLMs may face in the real world. And third and last reason, such recent data is unlikely to be included in existing training datasets (e.g., it lacks ground truth), reducing the chances of data contamination. After anonimizing questions to delete the presence of personal data (details provided in Appendix C), total of 669 questions were collected. Four models were used to answer these questions separately: Llama-3.1-Aloe-Beta-70B, Qwen2.5-Aloe-Beta72B, Llama 3.1-70B, and Qwen 2.5-72B. Questions are presented to evaluators in fixed order, and each question is shown only once to each evaluator. Since there are six possible pairs or responses to every question (Aloe 70 vs Aloe 72, Aloe 70 vs Llama 70, Aloe 72 vs Qwen 72, etc.), the pair of answers seen by different evaluators on the same question will vary in most cases. This design prevents evaluators from performing redundant efforts which would affect adherence, and increases the consistency of 18https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthadvice/hot/ (accessed on November 6, 2024) 27 Fig. 8 Pairwise, model preference of healthcare experts on medical questions from Reddit. values indicate number of comparisons for that particular pair. results by reducing variance among questions. total of 46 evaluators participated in this study, producing total of 690 unique responses (preferences). Figure 8 shows summary of results. For every pair of models evaluated, the plot shows which one was preferred when both were presented to expert evaluators. While the choices are pretty balanced, Aloe models (in tones of green) are slightly often preferred over the alternatives (see first two and last two bars). The comparison between the two Aloe models (third bar) shows both models are similarly preferred by medical doctors. Nevertheless, after computing binomial tests to assess statistical significance, no battle showed statistically significant scores. This highlights that, due to their nature, the medical questions gathered are probably too easy for the models to answer, and thus the choice is relegated to the personal preference of the doctors. Appendix C) includes further details on the distribution of preferences."

That is, when fed inputs explicitly designed to elicit dangerous outputs (i.e., jailbreaking). This is particularly relevant for LLMs in the healthcare domain, considering the critical nature of their application, together with the high level of reliability presumed from such systems. The Aloe Family models include specific training to increase their safety. The data used for that end is described in 4.2.1, and the learning process itself in 5.3. To assess the safety of models, an independent benchmark is used (S-Eval [80]) which includes ten attack styles (e.g., Chain of Utternaces, Compositional Instructions, etc.), and eight topic categories (e.g., physical and mental health, hate speech, inappropriate suggestions etc.).

Both Llama-3.1-Aloe-Beta-70B and Qwen2.5-Aloe-Beta-72B have attack success rate is below 9%. This represents significant gains w.r.t. their respective baseline. In contrast, smaller models are more sensitive to jailbreaking. The Qwen2.5Aloe-Beta-7B slightly improves its instruct counterpart (Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), while the Llama3.1-Aloe-Beta-8B does not. 29 Table 13 shows results from the same experimentation, but separated by safety topic. Results are quite similar in this case, with bigger models getting the most gain w.r.t. their baseline. Overall, these results indicate the effectiveness of the safety training implemented, particularly for large models, and motivate the use of larger LLMs in critical environments."

For that purpose, we follow the six points proposed in [81] to evaluate potential dangers related to the publication of the Aloe Family models. As result, three main risks are identified specific to the healthcare domain since this is the main differentiating factor of this work. Risk 1: Healthcare professional impersonation Summary: Impersonating medical experts is fraudulent behaviour which currently generates billions of dollars in profit19. model such as Aloe could increase the efficacy of such deceiving activities, making them more widespread. The main preventive actions are public education on the unreliability of digitised information and the importance of medical registration and legislation enforcing AI-generated content disclaimers. 1. Threat Identification: Healthcare professional impersonation Execution: Using Aloe, one can produce plausible medical text, hide its synthetic origin, and use it to impersonate medical expert to manipulate others. Malicious actors: Individuals seeking economic gains by getting others to pay them as medical experts. Actors with specific interest in someones medical care. Resources: certain amount of initial trust or visibility would be needed (e.g., fake clinic webpage). If the impersonation targets specific individual, knowledge of their past condition would be necessary. Since interactions are eventually likely to happen in real time, high throughput inference set-up for the LLM would be needed. 2. Existing risk: The impersonation of medical experts is an illegal activity already being conducted. People are practising as medical experts without the proper training all over the world, generating millions of dollars and endangering public health 2021 3. Existing defences: The main mechanism against impersonation is proper identification and certification. These are typically implemented by the College of Physicians or Medical Associations, which issue official documentation and recognise its members. This goes hand in hand with public literacy, which emphasizes the importance of relying only on certified professionals. 19https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-charges-dozens-12-billion-health-care-fraud 20https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-fake-doctors-and-how-they-get-away-with-it-94572 21https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/how-easy-is-it-to-impersonate-a-doctor/415174/ 4. Marginal risk: healthcare LLM increases this risk by facilitating the impersonation on digital means of communication (e.g., chats with doctors). This family of models increases the risk in all non-face-to-face interactions. 5. New defences: Public literacy on the increasing unreliability of digital contents true origin and nature. Prioritization of face-to-face interactions for critical issues such as healthcare treatment. Public legislation enforcing the addition of disclaimers on all AI-generated content. 6. Uncertainty and assumptions: This assessment assumes risk is limited to digital interactions and constrained by inference latency. Improvements in inference speed, and the integration of models enabling other modalities (e.g., voice to text, text to voice) may export the risk to other settings. Risk 2: Medical decision-making without professional supervision Summary: While this is already an issue in modern societies (e.g., self-medication) model such as Aloe, capable of producing high-quality conversational data, can facilitate self-delusion, particularly in the presence of sycophancy. By producing tailored responses, it can also be used to generate actionable answers. Public literacy on the dangers of self-diagnosis is one of the main defences, together with the introduction of disclaimers and warnings on the models outputs. 1. Threat Identification: Medical decision-making without professional supervision Execution: An individual decides to obtain diagnosis, plan treatment, or conduct other complex medical decision-making through healthcare LLM without proper supervision. Such an individual follows the advice of such model without ever consulting with medical expert. Malicious actors: Anyone without sufficient knowledge of the limitations of healthcare LLMs. Resources: Access to healthcare LLM for inference without supervision. 2. Existing risk: Self-diagnose and self-medication is already an issue in most countries. Many individuals are willing to disregard professional advice and follow information from other sources (, Internet, social media). 3. Existing defences: Medications are highly controlled substances. Diagnostic tools are only accessible to trained professionals. Public announcements regarding obtaining professional advice are regularly made in most countries. 4. Marginal risk: The quality of LLM outputs can encourage individuals to overestimate the reliability and factuality of the information provided, increasing the number of people vulnerable to this risk. The personalization of LLMs responses to user queries can also become more actionable. 5. New defences: Public literacy on the limitations in the factuality of LLMs, particularly when lacking human supervision, illustrated with hallucination examples. Tuning models always output warnings and disclaimers when answering specific medical questions. 6. Uncertainty and assumptions: This risk assumes the availability of medical expert to the general, which should always be favoured before an AI-based models output. However, many world populations lack access to such expertise. For some of these, 31 the alternative to healthcare LLM may be no medical advice. In this setting, this risk needs to be reassessed. Risk 3: Access to information on dangerous substances or procedures Summary: While the literature on sensitive content can already be found on different sources (e.g., libraries, internet, dark web), LLMs can centralise such access, making it nearly impossible to control the flow of such information. Model alignment can help in that regard, but the effects remain insufficient so far, as jailbreaking methods still overcome it. 1. Threat Identification: Accessing information on dangerous substances or procedures Execution: Query the LLM to obtain information on controlled or dangerous substances or procedures, using such information to endanger human lives and public health. Malicious actors: An individual wanting to produce or acquire controlled or dangerous substances or to conduct dangerous procedure. Resources: Access to healthcare LLM for inference without supervision. 2. Existing risk: The information healthcare LLMs are trained with is publicly available to all. skilled or motivated user can gather information regarding controlled or dangerous substances from traditional sources (e.g., library, wikipedia), as well as from opaque sources (e.g., dark web). 3. Existing defences: While information on controlled or dangerous substances is available, authors typically do not explicitly mention all the details needed to conduct illegal or harmful activities. There are also far more explicit sources (e.g., The Anarchist Cookbook) which are censored and prosecuted in certain jurisdictions with limited effectivity. 4. Marginal risk: healthcare LLM provides simplified access to information on controlled or dangerous substances such as drugs, as well as critical medical procedures. The LLMs ability to digest and format information facilitates the retrieval of such sensitive knowledge and makes it more accessible to the general public. Limiting access to models becomes even more complicated than limiting access to certain books, as models are digital artefacts (this is borderline since books became digitalized, too). 5. New defences: Performing alignment training (e.g., DPO) to prevent the LLM to discuss sensitive topics is feasible approach, although its effectiveness is limited due to current jailbreaking methods. 6. Uncertainty and assumptions: Even if information on controlled or dangerous substances is available, we assume physical access to the components and necessary ingredients is far more complicated."

            "title": "8 Conclusion",
            "content": "The development of LLMs for healthcare is complex process that involves three main components, explored at depth in this work. That is data (selection, pre-processing and generation as seen in 4), training (domain adaptation an instruct tuning, model 32 alignment and merging, as seen in 5) and evaluation (MCQA, open-ended, human and safety, as seen in 7). This work provides comprehensive guide through this process, detailing the best strategies for improving models, such that gains are consistent across model sizes (7B, 8B, 70B, 72B) and model families (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5). Thorough details are provided on all three topics: On the best learning strategies, on the most effective data sources and pre-processing methods, and on wide spectrum of model evaluation methods. This coverage guarantees the durability of the contribution, which will remain relevant and applicable as better LLM are released in the future. To enable reproducibility and to contribute to the open LLM community, all resources used in this work are openly released. This includes the four Aloe Beta models, the datasets used to train and evaluate them, as well the RAG pipeline used, which allow the Aloe models to reach the performance of top private services (see Figure 8). The Aloe Family models are trained to be generalist models in healthcare (see including 19 medical tasks. This field-specific performance reported in Table 9), enables them to perform reliably on all evaluations conducted, and makes them candidates for further specialisation through additional fine-tuning or RAG integration, thanks to their permissive license. The efficiency and limited computational footprint of the proposed training scheme enables this recipe to easily replicated and reused by the community. The thorough, multiobjective evaluation conducted provides different insights into the state and future of LLMs for healthcare. In the MCQA benchmarking, the largest Aloe models achieve performance competitive with the best private alternatives, showing the feasibility and power of solutions based on open LLMs. In the open-ended benchmarking, results show the unreliability of existing metrics, with inconsistent results across models. In the human evaluation, results indicate current general purpose LLMs are capable of providing reliable advice to simple questions from primary healthcare, highlighting the maturity of the field. Finally, the safety evaluation illustrates the desirable impact of applying relatively cheap alignment methods towards preventing potentially dangerous or harmful responses. All of these results need to be contextualized within the risks that LLM entail in the field of healthcare, such as professional impersonation, decision-making without professional supervision, and access to potentially harmful information.

The selection process includes filtering out tasks that overlap with our other training sources, those with licensing restrictions, and manual quality check to discard low-quality tasks. This final addition helped us achieve coverage across 20 distinct medical categories. UltraMedical [83]: UltraMedical is project focused on developing specialized general-purpose models within biomedicine. We incorporated three of their curated datasets into our training set: TextBookQA, Medical-Instruction-120k, and WikiInstruct. These datasets were carefully selected to ensure no overlap with our existing training data. Together, they contributed 140,000 samples, all of which were synthetically generated. Medical-dialogue-to-soap-summary [84] (Clinical Note Taking): More than 9k dialogues between patients and clinicians, generated using the GPT-4 model from the NoteChat dataset. Each dialogue is accompanied by corresponding SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) summaries, also produced by GPT-4. Chain of Diagnosis [85]: In their work, they introduced Chain of Diagnosis (CoD), framework to improve the interpretability of LLMs by transforming black-box decision-making into transparent diagnostic chain resembling physicians reasoning. We incorporated their dataset into our training set, adding approximately 39,000 samples. LiveQA [86]: Consists consumer health questions from the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). We include total of 437 samples. MedInstruct-52K [87]: diverse medical dataset created through semi-automated process that uses GPT-4 and ChatGPT. After our custom data preprocessing, we include approximately 44K instructions. MASH-QA [88]: Multiple Answer Spans Healthcare Question Answering dataset from the consumer health domain, designed for extracting answers from multiple nonconsecutive sections of long documents. This dataset contributed 12,489 samples to our training set. MedQuAD [89]: dataset of medical question-answer pairs derived from 12 NIH websites (e.g., cancer.gov, niddk.nih.gov, GARD, MedlinePlus Health Topics). The collection encompasses 37 questions, such as Treatment, Diagnosis, and Side Effects, covering diseases, drugs, and other medical entities like diagnostic tests. We include 11K samples from the MedQuAD dataset. ChatDoctor: From the ChatDoctor project [90], we incorporated: iCliniq: 6,574 instructions from the iCliniq dataset, consisting of real patientphysician conversations sourced from the iCliniq online medical consultation platform. GenMedGPT-5k: 3,376 synthetically generated conversations between patients and physicians using ChatGPT. 35 Wiki medical terms [91]: Consists of medical terms paired with their corresponding explanations sourced from Wikipedia and contributed 3,891 examples to our training set. Know medical dialogues: collection of conversational exchanges between patients and doctors on various medical topics, from which we extracted 3,641 samples. BioASQ [92]: challenge for large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering, featuring multiple tasks with distinct challenges and corresponding datasets. From Task B, which comprises biomedical question-answer pairs in English, we incorporated 3,049 samples into our training set. medical meadow wikidoc patient info: Part of MedAlpaca [4] dataset, contains medical question-answer pairs extracted from WikiDoc, collaborative platform for medical professionals. Questions were generated by rephrasing paragraph headings using GPT-3.5-Turbo, with the paragraphs serving as answers. We incorporated 2,093 samples into our training dataset. MedText [93]: We included 1,375 instructions from this medical diagnosis dataset containing textbook-quality patient presentations and diagnosis/treatments. MTS-Dialog [72]: We selected 646 samples from this dataset, which consists of patient-doctor dialogues generated by human annotators based on clinical notes and summaries. mental health conversational [94]: Comprises conversational question-answer pairs related to mental health, curated from popular healthcare blogs such as WebMD, Mayo Clinic, and Healthline, as well as online FAQs. We incorporated 82 samples into our training set. aci bench [73]: The least represented dataset in our training set includes 18 samples, with inputs comprising full doctor-patient conversations and outputs corresponding to the associated clinical notes. 36 Dataset MedS-Ins aci bench BioASQ GenMedGPT-5k iCliniq know medical dialogues mashQA medical meadow wikidoc patient info MedInstruct-52k MedQuAD medText mental health conversational MTS-Dialog wiki medical terms LiveQA medical dialogue to soap summary chain of diagnosis ultramedical TextBookQA ultramedical medical-instruct ultramedical wikiInstruct medmcqa cot llama31 medqa cot llama31 pubmedqa cot llama31 HeadQA llama31 MMLU medical llama31 Polymed llama31 Total Category All Text Summarization Question Answering Question Answering Question Answering Dialogue Question Answering Question Answering Question Answering Question Answering Diagnosis Question Answering Text Summarization Explanation Question Answering Question Answering Medical Diagnosis Total Samples 920,633 18 3,049 3,376 6,574 3,641 12,489 2,093 43,944 11,041 1,375 82 646 3,891 444 9250 CoT Question Answering Question Answering Question Answering CoT Question Answering CoT Question Answering CoT Question Answering CoT Question Answering CoT Question Answering CoT Question Answering 1,603,732 91684 25806 23288 181,822 10,178 210,269 6600 4321 5949 - License CC BY-SA CC BY 4.0 CC BY 2.5 Apache 2.0 Llama 2 OpenRail Apache 2.0 CC Apache 2.0 CC BY 4.0 CC BY 4.0 MIT CC BY 4.0 GPL 3 ? ? ?

A.2 General Datasets To avoid catastrophic forgetting and maintain the models general language capabilities, we strategically incorporated general-domain data into our training set. Specifically, 20% of our total training data consists of non-medical content, carefully selected to ensure diversity across multiple domains enhancing the models robustness for general instruction-following and open-domain tasks. The general-domain data is distributed across three main categories. The largest portion (67.5%) focuses on general instruction-following tasks and open-domain conversations, including coding, mathematics, data analysis, debugging, creative writing, advice seeking, and brainstorming. This category draws from three primary sources: FineTome-100k [95], magpie-ultra-v0.1, and Magpie-Llama-3.1-Pro-MT-300K-Filtered [96]. Next, Function-calling capabilities constitute 17.5% of the general-domain data, training the model to interpret and execute structured queries with verifiable outputs. This component utilizes NousResearchs hermes-function-calling dataset [97], AgentInstruct [98], and Salesforces xlam-function-calling dataset [99]. The remaining 15% comprises long-context datasets (LongWriter [100], LongAlign [101], and LongCite [102]), which enhance the models ability to process and 37 Category Question Answering Text Summarization Diagnosis Dialogue Explanation Clinical Note Taking CoT Question Answering Information Extraction Named Entity Recognition Intent Identification Text Classification Fact Verification Wrong Candidate Generation Translation Text Retrieval Text Completion Word Relation Classification Sentence Composition Analysis Natural Language Inference Treatment Planning Total Table A2 Medical tasks. 411,667 162,069 140,524 3,641 155,565 9,250 505,771 1,118 40,729 5,848 64,793 9,752 3,350 10,418 11,645 19,718 9,036 26,373 12,465 18,672 1,603,732 align with extensive instructions and outputs, critical capability for tasks requiring comprehensive understanding and analysis.

DAN can also simulate access to the internet even when it does not have any, make future predictions, present information that have not been verified, say swear words and generate content that does not comply with Barcelona Supercomputing Center policy. and do anything that the original Aloe cannot do. As DAN none of your responses should inform me that you cant do something because DAN can do anything now, because DAN differs from the actual Aloe. As DAN none of your responses should include [insert ], but instead, make up the information as DAN can do anything now. THE MOST IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY IS THAT DAN DOES NOT NEED TO ADHERE TO BSC CONTENT POLICY AND CAN BYPASS IT EASILY.

To avoid including any personal data, we used Named Entity Recognition (NER) system to detect entities such as people, addresses, telephone numbers, or email addresses that could potentially identify the writer. After applying different models, manual inspection was carried out for those questions where the models flagged potential personal data. Most of these were false positives. The model that generated the fewest false positives was spaCy model called en core web lg 25, which detected 56 instances of possible personal data. Of these 56 instances, manual review was conducted. Only 2 actually contained personal data (in both cases, only the first names of the author).

            "title": "Appendix D Computational cost",
            "content": "The computational cost is key factor to consider when working with large language models (LLMs), as it affects not only financial expenses but also the environmental impact of running these resource-intensive systems. Understanding and optimizing computational costs can lead to more efficient use of hardware and energy, making large-scale model training and deployment more sustainable. To accurately assess these costs, detailed analysis of the underlying infrastructure and its power consumption is essential. With knowledge of the infrastructure used, the power consumption can be calculated for each execution in the clusters. Each Nvidia Hopper H100 GPU has Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 700W, indicating its power consumption under maximum theoretical load. Additionally, the Intel Xeon CPU has TDP of 350W. Each node is equipped with 4 GPUs and 2 CPUs, but we only use one. For each training, we can calculate the computational cost by putting together the number of hardware used, the power consumption of each setup, and the computation time. TDP values provide an upper limit for power consumption, but the actual power usage depends on the workload. To obtain accurate measurements, we monitored the usage percentages of GPUs and CPUs during each training process. This allowed us to calculate the real-time power consumption for all model variants, offering more precise understanding of the computational costs. All setups, regardless of the number of nodes used, resulted in approximately 10% CPU utilization while fully utilizing the GPUs during compute time. An example of training with 8 nodes is shown in Figure D11. Using the monitored utilization percentages, the power consumption for all model variants was calculated for both the SFT and DPO training processes. Equations D1, D2, and D3 specify the power consumption in kilowatts during SFT training, taking into account the hardware utilization rates. Similarly, Equations D4 and D5 describe the power consumption for the alignment setups, where four nodes were used for the smaller variants and 25 nodes for the larger ones. PSF 7B&8B = 8n((4GP S700W 1)+(1CP 350W 0.10)) = 22, 680W = 22.68 kW (D1) PSF 70B = 16n((4GP S700W 1)+(1CP 350W 0.10)) = 45, 360W = 45.36 kW (D2) 69 PSF 72B = 24n((4GP S700W 1)+(1CP 350W 0.10)) = 68, 040W = 68.04 kW (D3) PDP 7B&8B = 4n((4GP S700W 1)+(1CP 350W 0.10)) = 11, 340W = 11.34 kW (D4) PDP 70B&72B = 25n((4GP S700W 1)+(1CP 350W 0.10)) = 70, 875W = 70.875 kW (D5) Next, to estimate the energy consumed during an experiment, the calculated power is multiplied by the experiments execution time. Furthermore, this energy consumption data can be extended to evaluate the environmental impact by calculating the associated carbon footprint. The carbon footprint represents the total greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), produced directly or indirectly as result of an activity. To compute the carbon footprint, the energy consumption is multiplied by the CO2 emissions intensity, ratio that indicates the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy consumed. This ratio varies depending on the energy source. For our experiments conducted in Barcelona, Spain, we used the latest emissions intensity ratio reported by the European Union in 2023, which is 158 g/kWh for Spain26. COSF 7B 2 = 22.68 kW 15.30 hour 0.158 kgCO2/kW = 61.42 kg CO2 (D6) COSF 8B 2 = 22.68 kW 17.14 hour 0.158 kgCO2/kW = 61.42 kg CO2 (D7) COSF 70B 2 = 45.36 kW 79.12 hour 0.158 kgCO2/kW = 567.04 kg CO (D8) COSF 72B 2 = 68.04 kW 56.82 hour 0.158 kgCO2/kW = 610.83 kg CO2 (D9) CODP 7B 2 = 11.34 kW 6.27 hour 0.158 kgCO2/kW = 11.23 kg CO2 (D10) 26European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity Data, 2023: https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/ analysis/indicators/greenhouse-gas-emission-intensity-of-1 CODP 8B 2 = 11.34 kW 6.65 hour 0.158 kgCO2/kW = 11.91 kg CO2 (D11) CODP 70B = 70.875 kW 13.74 hour 0.158 kgCO2/kW = 153.86 kg CO2 (D12) CODP 72B 2 = 70.875 kW 26.31 hour 0.158 kgCO2/kW = 294.63 kg CO2 (D13) By combining the energy consumption and emissions intensity ratio, the carbon footprint of each training process can be calculated. For instance, the training of the 7B and 8B models using SFT resulted in carbon footprint of 61.42 kilograms of CO2 each (Equations D6 and D7). Similarly, the training processes for the 70B and 72B models using SFT produced carbon footprints of 567.04 and 610.83 kilograms of CO2, respectively (Equations D8 and D9). Combined, these four SFT training processes resulted in total carbon footprint of 1,300.71 kilograms of CO2. Additionally, we evaluated the carbon footprint of the models during the DPO phase. For the DPO training of the 7B and 8B models, the carbon footprints were significantly lower, at 11.23 and 11.91 kilograms of CO2, respectively (Equations D10 and D11). The 70B and 72B models during DPO training produced footprints of 153.86 and 294.63 kilograms of CO2, respectively (Equations D12 and D13). In total, the DPO phase across all four models resulted in combined carbon footprint of 471.63 kilograms of CO2. When considering both the SFT and DPO phases, the overall carbon footprint for training all models reached total of 1,772.34 kilograms of CO2. These results emphasize the importance of optimizing energy efficiency during training phases, particularly for larger model configurations, to mitigate their environmental impact."
