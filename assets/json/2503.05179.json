            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of performing complex reasoning tasks across diverse domains (Zhao et al., 2024; Bubeck et al., 2023). Despite not being explicitly trained for reasoning, these models demonstrate emergent capabilities when prompted effectively to decompose complex problems into intermediate steps. Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2023) represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in eliciting these reasoning abilities, guiding models to articulate their thinking process step-by-step before producing final answer. This technique has substantially improved 1https://www.github.com/SimonAytes/SoT 1 Figure 1: comparison of accuracy and token usage in the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2023) and the proposed Sketch-of-Thought (SoT). Average of tests across 15 datasets using the family of Qwen-2.5 models. Shaded region represents more efficient reasoning. performance on tasks from mathematical problemsolving to logical reasoning (Sprague et al., 2024). While CoT effectively enhances reasoning accuracy, it typically generates verbose intermediate steps that substantially increase token usage and computational costs. This verbosity presents significant challenges for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained environments where inference expenses and latency are critical concerns (Nayab et al., 2025; Arora and Zanette, 2025). Subsequent research has expanded upon CoT with more sophisticated approaches: Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023b) generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most frequent answer, Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023) explores branching decision trees of possible reasoning routes, and Graph of Thoughts (Besta et al., 2024) structures reasoning as interconnected nodes allowing for more complex deduction patterns. While these methods further enhance reasoning capabilities through diverse exploration strategies, they generally amplify rather than reduce the underlying token inefficiency. To address this, we present Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), prompting framework that fundamentally reimagines how language models express their reasoning processes. Our approach draws inspiration from cognitive science, particularly the concept of \"sketches\" as articulated in Goel (1995), which characterizes them as symbolic representations that serve as efficient intermediaries in cognitive processes. Consider how an expert physicist might work through complex problem: rather than writing full sentences explaining each step, they might jot down key variables, scribble abbreviated equations, and use domain-specific notation that would be nearly incomprehensible to non-expertyet these concise marks capture the essence of their reasoning process. Similarly, when we take notes during lecture or meeting, we naturally abbreviate, use arrows to show connections, and omit obvious context, creating \"sketches\" of ideas rather than verbose descriptions. As such, these sketches appear in countless domains, and in each case, the sketches serve as efficient thinking tools that omit verbosity while preserving essential reasoning steps. Motivated by this, we develop three distinct paradigms grounded in cognitive science principles that mirror how humans streamline their reasoning processes. These paradigms leverage specific cognitive mechanisms: Conceptual Chaining draws on associative memory networks to connect ideas with minimal verbalization, Chunked Symbolism applies working memory chunking theory to organize mathematical reasoning into concise symbolic representations, and Expert Lexicons emulates the efficient domain-specific shorthand used by specialists. Each paradigm addresses different reasoning demands while significantly reducing token usage compared to traditional verbose reasoning. To implement these paradigms, we instantiate LLMs through carefully engineered prompts and exemplars, allowing our approach to work with any models without requiring specific training. key challenge in deploying these paradigms effectively is determining which approach best suits each particular reasoning task. To address this, we develop lightweight router model that dynamically selects the optimal reasoning paradigm based on query characteristics, ensuring that the most efficient reasoning strategy is applied to each problem. Our comprehensive evaluation across 15 reasoning datasets (spanning mathematical, commonsense, logical, multi-hop, scientific, and medical tasks and domains) shows that the proposed SoT not only preserves accuracy in most domains but occasionally improves it, particularly for mathematical and multi-hop reasoning. We further demonstrate SoTs versatility through multilingual and multimodal experiments, confirming its effectiveness across different languages and input modalities. These results suggest that concise, structured reasoning can be as effective as (and sometimes superior to) the verbose explanations typically generated by traditional prompting approaches. We summarize our contributions as follows: We introduce Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), novel prompting framework with three specialized reasoning paradigms grounded in cognitive science principles. We develop lightweight auxiliary model that dynamically chooses the optimal reasoning paradigm for each query. Evaluations across diverse reasoning datasets (including multilingual and multimodal scenarios) show that SoT reduces token usage by up to 76% with minimal accuracy impact, and even improves performance in some tasks."

            "content": "We start by providing background on large language models and their application to reasoning. Large Language Models Large Language Models (LLMs) are models trained on vast text corpora to predict the next token in sequence. Formally, an LLM with parameters θ takes an input sequence of tokens and generates an output sequence y, represented as = LLMθ(x). These models have shown remarkable performance across disparate domains;, however, their computational efficiency remains significant concern as inference costs scale with the number of tokens processed and generated as well as their parameter sizes. 2 Figure 2: Comparison of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Sketch-of-Thought (SoT) workflows. While CoT generates verbose reasoning steps directly from prompts, SoT employs router model to select the optimal reasoning paradigm, producing significantly more compact intermediate steps while maintaining accuracy. Instantiating LLMs for Reasoning with Prompts Recent LLMs demonstrate emergent reasoning capabilitiesthe ability to solve complex problems through step-by-step logical deduction despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. The primary method for eliciting reasoning from LLMs is through prompting, where carefully constructed natural language instructions guide the models generation process (Wei et al., 2023). Let represent prompt template that includes task description, instructions, and exemplars. The reasoning process can then be formalized as = LLMθ(P (q)), where is the query and is the reasoning path. As one approach to elicit the reasoning ability of LLMs, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting instructs models to decompose problems into intermediate steps before producing the final answer. Formally, this can be expressed as [s1, s2, ..., sn, a] = LLMθ(PCoT(q)), where si represents the i-th reasoning step and is the final answer. Its example is shown in the box below."

Verification: This makes sense because the train moves 60 miles each hour. After 3 hours, it will have covered 3 times that distance. </think> Answer: 180 miles While this approach improves reasoning accuracy, it tends to generate verbose explanations that significantly increase token usage and computational costs, especially when LLMs are large."

            "content": "Sketch-of-Thought (SoT) addresses key limitation in traditional reasoning approaches: the verbosity of intermediate reasoning steps s1, s2, ..., sn that significantly increases token usage and computational costs. It is worth noting that, unlike prior work on efficient prompting that primarily focuses on reducing the input prompt size (q) (Jiang et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024), our approach targets the reasoning process itself by redesigning how language models articulate their intermediate steps. Formally, we develop specialized prompt templates PSoT that guide models to generate concise [ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsm, a] = LLMθ(PSoT(q)), reasoning: where ˆsi represents sketched reasoning step that conveys the same logical information as si but with substantially fewer tokens, i.e., ˆs < where measures the number of tokens. These templates combine cognitive-inspired paradigms with lcrguistic constraints that dictate structure and verbosity level of responses. We then operationalize our approach with cognitive sketching by translating human cognitive shortcuts into systematic prompting strategies. SoT instructs language models to express reasoning through high-efficiency patterns similar to how experts use abbreviated notations in their domains. It is worth noting that, while the operation of SoT is 3 flexible enough to incorporate any custom reasoning paradigms (based on cognitive science), as an initial foray, we include three reasoning paradigms, each tailored to specific types of reasoning tasks. Also, this implementation requires no model finetuning only carefully designed prompt templates inspired by cognitive science principles. We now turn to concretizing these paradigms alongside examples that illustrate how SoT distills essential reasoning steps into more efficient representations. Conceptual Chaining. Rooted in cognitive science principles of how humans connect and retrieve related information, this paradigm creates concise logical sequences between key concepts. It draws from episodic buffer integration (Baddeley, 2000), the cognitive mechanism that temporarily holds and links information from different sources, and associative memory networks (Anderson, 1983), which describe how activating one concept automatically triggers related concepts in our minds (like how thinking of \"rain\" might immediately evoke \"umbrella\"). Conceptual Chaining extracts essential terms and presents reasoning as direct step-by-step pathways with minimal text, shown below."

Chunked Symbolism. Based on working memory chunking theory (Miller, 1956), this paradigm organizes numerical and symbolic reasoning into compact, structured steps. This seminal cognitive science research showed that humans can only hold about 72 (i.e., 5 to 9) distinct items in working memory at once, but we overcome this limitation by \"chunking\" related information into meaningful unitslike remembering phone numbers as area code, prefix, and line number instead of 10 separate digits. Chunked Symbolism applies this principle by condensing mathematical reasoning into dense symbolic representations that pack more information into fewer tokens. It systematically extracts variables, equations, and operations while eliminating verbose explanations, transforming natural language into structured mathematical shorthand that preserves logical flow, as follows."

Expert Lexicons. Inspired by expert schema research (Chi et al., 1981), this paradigm leverages domain-specific shorthand and specialized notation to condense reasoning. This research demonstrated that experts in any field organize knowledge differently than novicesthey develop mental frameworks (schemas) that allow them to quickly recognize patterns and use specialized terminology to communicate efficiently with peers. For example, physician can convey complex medical conditions with few acronyms that would require paragraphs of explanation for non-specialists. Expert Lexicons mimics this cognitive efficiency by employing domain-specific abbreviations, notation, and symbols that pack multiple concepts into single tokens. The example below demonstrates how domain-specialized reasoning can be compressed into concise notation while preserving the critical logical connections."

To achieve this, we propose lightweight router model that analyzes question characteristics based on linguistic indicators such as mathematical symbols, multihop dependencies, or domain-specific terminology, and selects the most suitable approach based on these structural and semantic features. Specifically, given the query q, our router model is denoted as follows: PSoT = ROUTER(q), where 4 PSoT is one among three reasoning paradigms (to instantiate LLMs for their efficient reasoning) and ROUTER is smaller language model (Sanh et al., 2020). Also, this model is trained with samples (from reasoning tasks) that are paired with the most appropriate paradigm. This design ensures minimal computational overhead in inference while maintaining flexibility across input types. Specific implementation details are provided in Section 3.3."

For the classification model, we selected DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2020) due to its favorable balance of efficiency and performance. As lightweight version of BERT, it offers sufficient representational capacity for this classification task while introducing minimal computational overhead in the inference pipeline. This efficiency is particularly important since paradigm selection occurs as preprocessing step for every query. The model processes only the question text without associated contextual information, utilizing context token in cases where contextual data would normally be present. This design choice ensures extensibility to multimodal inputs where the context might be an image or other non-textual element.

            "content": "As shown in Table 1, Sketch-of-Thought (SoT) achieves substantial token reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across all model sizes. Specifically, SoT reduces token usage by 76.22%, 71.80%, and 71.90% for the 32B, 14B, and 7B models respectively, with minimal accuracy differences of -0.46%, -0.14%, and -0.74%. This dramatic efficiency gain with negligible performance penalty demonstrates that extensive verbalization is not necessary for effective reasoning in language models. The consistency of these results across model sizes is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that the benefits of SoT are not dependent on model scale. Rather than requiring larger models to maintain accuracy with reduced tokens, we find that all model sizes benefit similarly from the SoT approach. This has significant implications for practical applications where computational resources are limited. Commonsense and Scientific Reasoning. These categories demonstrate the most dramatic token reductions (77-85%) with minimal accuracy impact. For commonsense reasoning, the 32B model maintains slight accuracy advantage (+0.33%) despite using 83.87% fewer tokens. Similarly, scientific reasoning shows consistent performance with dramatically reduced verbosity. These results indicate that domains with well-established conceptual frameworks are particularly amenable to compression, as models can leverage concise terminology and structured representations to maintain reasoning quality. Logical and Multi-hop Reasoning. Logical reasoning tasks show substantial token reduction (7478%) with variable accuracy impacts across model sizes. Most interestingly, multi-hop reasoning demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements across all models (+2.45%, +2.22%, and +0.44%) despite token reductions of 67-72%. This counterintuitive finding suggests that verbosity constraints may enhance focus on critical inferential links while reducing distracting elaborations, leading to more precise multi-hop reasoning. Specialized Reasoning. In the specialized medical domain, we observe significant token reductions (57-78%) with more variable accuracy trade-offs across model sizes (-6.55%, -2.55%, and +1.00%). The larger accuracy variance suggests that highly technical domains may require more careful calibration of verbosity constraints, particularly for larger models. Nevertheless, even in this challenging category, the efficiency gains remain substantial and the performance impact acceptable for many applications."

In mathematical tasks, SoT achieves token reductions of 60.18%, 58.73%, and 59.44% across the 32B, 14B, and 7B models while maintaining or even improving accuracy (+2.77%, -0.28%, and -0.36%). The Chunked Symbolism paradigm proves especially effective here, leveraging symbolic notation to express complex calculations with minimal text. Notably, the 32B models improved accuracy suggests that structured constraints may actually enhance mathematical reasoning by focusing the Our experiments demonstrate that SoTs benefits extend beyond standard English-language textual reasoning to both multilingual and multimodal scenarios. As shown in Table 3, SoT maintains its efficiency advantages in multimodal reasoning tasks, achieving an 81.46% token reduction with modest 3.44% accuracy decrease. This indicates that SoT can dramatically reduce verbosity while preserving most performance even when reasoning requires visual and textual integration. 7 Similarly, the multilingual results in Table 2 demonstrate consistent token reductions across Korean (85.71%), Italian (85.12%), and German (85.11%) with minimal accuracy impacts (-1.01%, -2.00%, and +1.50%).

While SC improves accuracy for both approaches, it dramatically amplifies the token efficiency advantage of SoT. The SC+SoT combination maintains comparable accuracy to SC+CoT while using 76.22%, 71.80%, and 71.90% fewer tokens for the 32B, 14B, and 7B models respectively. This finding is particularly significant as it demonstrates that SoT can be effectively combined with other reasoning enhancement techniques.

This efficiency gain could significantly improve the practicality of advanced reasoning capabilities in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices, edge computing, and regions with limited computational infrastructure. Moreover, the minimal accuracy trade-offs across diverse reasoning tasks suggest that SoT represents genuine advancement in reasoning efficiency rather than merely performance compromise. By structuring and constraining the reasoning process according to cognitive principles, SoT enables models to focus on essential logical connections while eliminating redundant elaboration, resulting in more computationally efficient reasoning without sacrificing effectiveness."

            "content": "Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, driven largely by prompting techniques that guide their step-bystep thinking processes. Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2023) pioneered this approach by instructing models to break down complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps before providing final answers. This foundational work inspired numerous extensions: SelfConsistency (Wang et al., 2023b) generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most consistent answer, Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023) explores branching reasoning pathways to solve more complex problems, and Graph of Thoughts (Besta et al., 2024) structures reasoning as interconnected nodes in graph. Recent innovations have explored orthogonal approaches to reasoning enhancement, such as Coconut (Hao et al., 2024), which moves reasoning into continuous latent space rather than using discrete tokens. These latent space methods address fundamentally different aspects of reasoning than our token-efficiency focus, as they require architectural modifications rather than prompting strategies. While these various approaches have significantly improved reasoning accuracy across challenging tasks, they generally achieve these gains by generating increasingly complex reasoning processesexpanding rather than reducing the computational overhead of inference."

Input-side optimizations include LLMLingua (Jiang et al., 2023), which compresses prompts to accelerate inference, and automated prompt optimization techniques that systematically refine prompts for better performance (Pryzant et al., 2023). Huang et al. (2024) introduced CoT-Influx, which employs coarseto-fine pruner to maximize the input of effective and concise CoT examples, significantly improving mathematical reasoning performance without model fine-tuning. Other works focus on more efficient few-shot learning, with Fu et al. (2023) demonstrating how smaller language models can be specialized for multi-step reasoning tasks. On the output side, Arefeen et al. (2023) introduced techniques for more compact context representation, while Yue et al. (2024) proposed using mixture of thoughts representations in an LLM cascade to balance cost efficiency and reasoning performance. Most recently, Arora and Zanette (2025) introduced reinforcement learning approach to 8 train reasoning models that dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. However, these approaches typically focus on either input compression or reasoning structure optimization, rather than directly addressing the verbosity of model outputs during the reasoning process itself."

Concise Chain-of-Thought (Renze and Guven, 2024) pioneered more compact reasoning chains by simply instructing models to limit their response length, while SCOTT (Wang et al., 2023a) explored two-stage approach that first generates verbose reasoning and then distills it into more efficient forms. Building on these foundations, several very recent works have made significant advances: Nayab et al. (2025) introduced Constrained-CoT (CCoT), which encourages conciseness through explicit prompting with examples of compact reasoning while proposing metrics to evaluate \"correct conciseness\" and information flow. Our work addresses these limitations by developing distinct reasoning paradigms directly derived from established cognitive science principles (episodic buffer integration, working memory chunking, and expert schema theory), each tailored to specific task types for more effective token-efficient reasoning."

            "content": "While Sketch-of-Thought demonstrates substantial benefits for reasoning efficiency, we acknowledge several limitations in our current approach. Although we dynamically select reasoning paradigms, we use static exemplars within each paradigm rather than adapting them for specific task types (e.g., arithmetic vs. physics calculations). Our evaluation is also limited to models from the Qwen-2.5 family, which provides consistency for comparison but leaves questions about performance across different architectures. Additionally, the larger accuracy declines in specialized domains like medical reasoning (-6.55% for the 32B model) suggest that verbosity constraints may require domain-specific calibration for critical domains. Future work could address these limitations through several promising directions. Implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) could enable dynamic selection of not only reasoning paradigms but also task-specific exemplars, while development of additional specialized paradigms could address cognitive operations not optimally served by current approaches. Finally, investigating reasoning model trained specifically on SoT could yield significant advances, potentially teaching models to internalize the principles of concise reasoning while eliminating accuracy penalties observed in specialized domains. More sophisticated paradigm selection models could incorporate additional signals beyond question text to improve paradigm matching."

By combining cognitive-inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints, SoT achieves token reductions of 71-76% across model sizes with minimal accuracy trade-offs (-0.14% to -0.74%). These efficiency gains extend across diverse reasoning tasks, multiple languages, and even multimodal scenarios, demonstrating the broad applicability of our approach. The success of SoT challenges conventional assumptions about verbosity requirements in language model reasoning and offers practical solution for computationally efficient AI reasoning. As large language models continue to play increasingly important roles in resource-constrained environments, approaches like SoT that optimize computational efficiency without sacrificing reasoning capabilities will be essential for democratizing access to advanced AI reasoning technologies."
