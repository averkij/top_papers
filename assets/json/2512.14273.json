Introduction Large video-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding (Li et al., 2023, 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2023; Ataallah et al., 2024). However, current LVLMs often struggle to remain faithfully grounded in key visual evidence, leading to hallucinations when reasoning across video sequences. To evaluate this critical capability, video temporal grounding (VTG) (Gao et al., 2017; Anne Hendricks et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2021) measures how well models localize segments given an explicit event description, while the more comprehensive task of grounded video question answering (GVQA) (Xiao et al., 2024) requires models to implicitly infer the relevant moment from general question for temporal localization and simultaneously generating accurate answers. The key challenge of GVQA lies in achieving precise temporal localization while maintaining general video understanding capabilities. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promising solution for sharpening specific capabilities while preserving generalization from pretrained LVLM (Lai et al., 2025). Recent efforts (Li et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2025) have explored GRPO-based (Shao et al., 2024) RL algorithm for video temporal grounding and reasoning. However, most approaches (Wang et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025) optimize with only format and Intersection over Union (IoU) rewards, neglecting the quality of the generated answers. Although VideoChat-R1 (Li et al., 2025) incorporates an answer accuracy reward, these training objectives still cannot guarantee that localized video segments actually contain the visual evidence required for correct reasoning. * Work done during the internship at NVIDIA. 2025 NVIDIA.

Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Figure 1: Our Zoom-Zero first rolls out samples to localize relevant segments with preliminary answers in the coarse-grained pass, then zooms into spotlight segments with higher-resolution video tokens in the fine pass. For example, the coarse pass may miss the small visual cue 29%, but the zoom-in captures the fine-grained details. This fine-grained visual verification (zoom-in accuracy reward) ensures that the temporally grounded segments truly provide key visual evidence. Moreover, limited context budgets compel models to depend on coarse-grained representations, which overlook the fine-grained details critical for accurate question answering, shortcoming that becomes especially severe in long videos where rich spatial information can be easily lost. To address such challenges, we propose Zoom-Zero to achieve more accurate temporal grounding with finergrained video understanding. First, we introduce zoom-in accuracy reward for GRPO in the GVQA task. It serves two critical roles: (1) verifying that grounded segments contain requisite evidence to answer the query, and (2) enabling dynamic context reallocation by zooming into key frames with increased spatial resolution. As illustrated in Figure 1, our approach first rolls out several samples to localize the relevant segments and produce preliminary answers in the coarse-grained pass. It then performs fine-grained pass by narrowing down and zooming into the spotlight segments, dynamically allocating high-resolution video tokens. For instance, the coarse pass may overlook the small visual detail 29% due to low-resolution tokens. Only by correctly grounding the segment and zooming into the relevant frames can the model capture such details and produce the right answer, thereby achieving the highest reward among all rollouts. This hierarchical paradigm resembles human visual cognition: breaking down complex problems, identifying relevant temporal intervals, and then refining focus to extract precise details. In addition, when training with multi-faceted rewards (e.g., temporal localization accuracy, answer correctness) in the GVQA task, the standard GRPO algorithm (Shao et al., 2024) has key limitations. First, it compresses multiple reward signals into single value via naïve summation, making it hard to differentiate targeted improvements for different aspects of the task. Second, the uniform credit assignment problem: it assigns an identical reward (advantage) to every token in sequence based solely on the final outcome, regardless of weighting each tokens contribution. We address this by introducing token-selective credit assignment (TokenAdv), which selectively attributes credit to tokens specifically for temporal grounding or question answering, enabling finer-grained advantage estimation and more effective learning from diverse signals. Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of Zoom-Zero across challenging benchmarks, including GVQA datasets NExT-GQA (Xiao et al., 2024), ReXTime (Chen et al., 2024), and CG-Bench (Chen et al., 2025), as well as long video understanding benchmarks VideoMME (Fu et al., 2025), MLVU (Zhou et al., 2025), and LVBench (Wang et al., 2024). Our method mutually enhances temporal grounding capability and question-answering performance. It advances temporal grounding by 5.2% on NExT-GQA and 4.6% on ReXTime. The main contributions of this work are: We introduce zoom-in accuracy reward that verifies localized segments contain the visual evidence required for correct reasoning in finer-grained manner, enhancing both localization precision and answer accuracy. We identify and address the limit of GRPO in handling multi-faceted reward signals by selective token-level credit assignment, enabling effective learning from diverse reward signals in GVQA. Our coarse-to-fine paradigm further enhances long-form video understanding by first coarsely identifying key segments and then zooming into fine-grained details, preserving global context while capturing critical information, resulting in an average 6.4% improvement on long-video benchmarks. 2. Related Work Large Video Language Models. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (Zhu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024,; Tong et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023) have demonstrated remarkable progress in vision-language tasks. Recent advancements have further extended their capabilities to video understanding tasks (Li et al., 2023, 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2023; Ataallah et al., 2024). Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) process videos by extracting and encoding frames, and then rearranging them into final video representations. Some approaches (Li et al., 2023, 2024; Cheng et al., 2024) leverage the Q-Former module from BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023) to integrate visual and textual features, while others (Lin et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2023; Ataallah et al., 2024) directly concatenate frame features. To address intensive video tokens for long videos, several works train on sparsely sampled frames (Li et al., 2023; Ataallah et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024), while others try to handle long videos by token pooling (Maaz et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024), token compression (Shen et al., 2025), memory aggregation (He et al., 2024), retrieval approaches (Ren et al., 2025; Shen et al., 2025), or frame selection (Hu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2025). Unlike frame-selection methods that search in the embedding space and select fixed set of frames, our approach tackles the long-video token challenge by explicitly enhancing the models temporal grounding capability through reasoning over the user query. Grounded Video Question Answering. Video Temporal Grounding (Gao et al., 2017; Anne Hendricks et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2021) localizes relevant segments given an explicit event description. The more advanced task of Grounded Video Question Answering (GVQA) (Xiao et al., 2024) requires models to implicitly infer the relevant segment from general question to perform localization and question-answering jointly. Recent LVLM-based approaches reformulate grounding as text generation (Nie et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2025) while other methods (Wang et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2024) expand vocabularies to learn temporal embeddings for improved precision. Our approach leverages Qwen2.5VL (Bai et al., 2025) to predict textual temporal spans and introduces novel coarse-to-fine training paradigm: initially predicting coarse timestamps for global localization, then dynamically zooming into identified segments for high-resolution visual verification. In contrast with concurrent work (Li et al., 2025) that relies on separate off-the-shelf VideoQA models to answer the query based on localized segments, our unified framework seamlessly integrates temporal grounding with question-answering within single model for coherent video understanding. Reinforcement Learning for Grounded Video Question Answering. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as powerful paradigm for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. Breakthroughs such as OpenAI-o1 (Jaech et al., 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) have demonstrated notable success in addressing complex problems. DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) adopts group relative policy optimization 3 Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in (GRPO) to train LLMs to incentivize reasoning capability at inference time. Recently, RL has been adapted to LVLMs with the goal of strengthening video reasoning (Li et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2025). Time-R1 (Wang et al., 2025) and TVG-R1 (Chen et al., 2025) adopt two-stage pipeline, beginning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as cold start, followed by GRPO-based RL training, while TimeZero (Wang et al., 2025) demonstrates that purely GRPO approach can be more effective without an SFT stage. These methods leverage only format and Intersection over Union (IoU) reward, whereas VideoChat-R1 (Li et al., 2025) further integrates answer accuracy into RL training. In this work, we enhance GRPO by decoupling multi-faceted reward signals for selective token-level advantage estimation. 3. Preliminary GRPO. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) is variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) for reinforcement learning. Unlike PPO, which relies on critic model, GRPO directly compares groups of candidate responses. This design eliminates the dependency on critic, generates 𝐺 thereby substantially reducing training costs. Given question-answer pair (𝑞, 𝑎), policy 𝜋𝜃old distinct candidate responses 𝑜 = 𝑜1, . . . , 𝑜𝐺 through policy sampling. Then, the verifiable reward(s) 𝑟1, . . . , 𝑟𝐺 is calculated for each response. GRPO normalizes the scores by computing their mean and standard deviation, and then evaluates the relative quality of the responses accordingly. 𝐴𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑟𝑖 mean({𝑟𝑖}𝐺 std({𝑟𝑖}𝐺 𝑖=1) 𝑖=1) , (1) where 𝐴𝑖,𝑡 denotes the relative quality of the 𝑡-th token in 𝑖-th response. GRPO promotes higher-scoring answers within each group while regularizing the policy 𝜋𝜃 against the reference parameters 𝜋ref via KL-divergence penalty 𝐷KL(), leading to the final objective: max 𝜋𝜃 (𝑞,𝑎),{𝑜𝑖}𝐺 𝑖=1𝜋𝜃old (𝑞) [ 1 𝐺 𝐺 𝑖=1 1 𝑜𝑖 𝑜𝑖 𝑡=1 ( 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖,𝑡𝑞, 𝑜𝑖,<𝑡) 𝜋𝜃old (𝑜𝑖,𝑡𝑞, 𝑜𝑖,<𝑡) 𝐴𝑖,𝑡 𝛽 𝐷KL(𝜋𝜃 𝜋ref ) )] , (2) where 𝛽 is regularization coefficient, preventing excessive deviation from the reference policy during optimization. Dynamic Spatiotemporal Resolution. Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) dynamically adjusts tokens to determine the number of tokens per frame under fixed video context budget. Specifically, the video context size is denoted as 𝐿𝑣, the maximum tokens per frame as 𝑉max, the minimum tokens per frame as 𝑉min, the video duration as 𝐹 seconds, and the sampling rate as 𝑠 frames per second. Based on these, the per-frame token resolution 𝑉res is defined as follows: ( 𝑁 = min 𝐹 * 𝑠, ) 𝐿𝑣 𝑉min , 𝑉res = max 𝑉min, min( ( ) , 𝑉max) 𝐿𝑣 𝑁 (3) 4. Zoom-Zero We propose coarse-to-fine framework for grounded video question answering: coarse-grained pass predicts query-conditioned intervals, followed by fine-grained zoom-in that takes as input only the localized segments at higher per-frame token resolution (Section 4.1). Beyond standard format, IoU, and answer-accuracy rewards, we introduce zoom-in accuracy reward to verify evidence within the localized span (Section 4.2). To overcome GRPOs limit in uniform credit assignment, we develop token-selective credit assignment for finer-grained advantage estimation tailored to multi-faceted rewards in the GVQA task (Section 4.3). 4 Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Figure 2: We present Zoom-Zero, coarse-to-fine training pipeline that first rolls out samples to localize relevant segments with preliminary answers, followed by fine-grained pass by zooming into spotlight segments and dynamically allocating high-resolution video tokens. The zoom reward enforces fine-grained visual verification of the predicted temporal span. In this example, only faithful span prediction with the correct final answer yields the highest reward. Then we propose token-selective credit assignment (TokenAdv) for finer-grained advantage estimation. 4.1. Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-In While dynamic token allocation offers flexibility, fundamental trade-off remains: capturing long-range temporal context versus preserving fine-grained visual detail. Spatial or temporal downsampling inevitably discards critical information. This problem is exacerbated in longer videos, where preserving more frames often comes at the expense of per-frame spatial granularity. coarse-to-fine strategy provides principled remedy: coarse pass preserves temporal context, followed by fine-grained stage that processes evidence-bearing segments through temporal zoom-in1. More specifically, we leverage the models temporal grounding capability to perform fine-grained zoom-in on relevant segments and recover the details of the video. From the coarse view of the video, we obtain grounded startend pairs (𝑠1, 𝑒1), (𝑠2, 𝑒2), . . . , (𝑠𝑛, 𝑒𝑛). We crop the video accordingly, yielding 𝑁 < 𝑁 frames. Under fixed visual token budget 𝐿𝑣, the per-frame video tokens increases from 𝑉res = 𝐿𝑣 𝑁 > 𝑉res, 𝑁 enabling more fine-grained visual verification of the selected segments. This coarse-to-fine temporal zoom-in preserves global context while concentrating high-resolution capacity on the frames that matter most. res = 𝐿𝑣 to 𝑉 Crucially, this paradigm hinges on accurate, query-conditioned temporal grounding. To this end, we leverage GRPO-based reinforcement learning with carefully designed rewards that jointly improve temporal grounding and question answering, as detailed in the following section. 4.2. Rewards Design In this section, we first review the basic rewards used in GVQA, i.e., format, temporal grounding, and answer accuracy, and then introduce our proposed zoom-in reward for fine-grained visual verification. 1We term it temporal zoom-in, not spatiotemporal, to avoid confusion, since no spatial regions are predicted from the model. However, the spatio-temporal grid size per token is increased, since salient frames are sampled at higher temporal resolution (if the full video was sparsely sampled in the coarse pass), and spatial resolution is dynamically increased. Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Format Reward. To guide the model toward producing responses in the desired format, we require the output to follow the instructions below: Format Prompt and Template Answer the question: [QUESTION] according to the content of the video. Select the answer from: [OPTIONS]. Output key information relevant to the question and options, marking precise timestamps or time ranges in seconds within <time> </time> tags, and present them in an interleaved analysis format. Enclose the full analysis in <think> </think> tags. Then, provide your answer within the <answer> </answer> tags, output the corresponding letter of the option. At the same time, in the <glue> </glue> tags, include only the precise video segments (in seconds) that strongly support your answer, in the format of [(s1, e1), (s2, e2), ...]. For example: <answer>A</answer><glue> [(20.3, 30.8)] </glue>. We then apply regular expression matching to verify whether the model output conforms to this format. 𝑅format is assigned as 1 if the format fully matches the template. Answer Accuracy Reward. We define reward 𝑅Acc to evaluate the correctness of the policy models answer in coarse understanding by taking as input the whole video. Temporal Grounding Reward. For temporal grounding, the model is required to predict timestamp interval that specifies the video segment relevant to the given textual query. To evaluate this prediction, we adopt the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the model-predicted interval (from <glue> </glue>) and the ground-truth interval as the reward function. 𝑅IoU = ℐpredℐgt , where ℐpred and ℐgt are the predicted time ℐpredℐgt intervals and the ground truth intervals. Zoom Accuracy Reward. Based on the temporal grounding prediction (from <glue> </glue>) in the coarse pass, we can obtain set of salient frames that enables fine-grained visual verification. In the finer-grained pass, the model takes as input the question and the zoomed-in frames from the coarse response to produce the final answer. The reward 𝑅Zoom is assigned value of 1 if the model produces an accurate final answer. This reward provides two key benefits: (1) enabling visual verification to ensure the predicted timestamp is accurately grounded in the relevant frames, and (2) facilitating coarse-to-fine visual zoom-in to capture details within key frames. 4.3. Token-Selective Credit Assignment for Advantage Estimation Since our approach involves multiple rewards, i.e., 𝑅format, 𝑅Acc, 𝑅Zoom, and 𝑅IoU, the key question becomes how to leverage them for the policy updates. Standard GRPO handles multi-faceted rewards by naïvely summing them into single scalar, thereby collapsing the contributions of individual reward signals. The advantage is then estimated only from this aggregated value (Equation 1), which cannot be decoupled for gradient updates. As result, the model receives no explicit guidance on which aspect of its behavior each reward reflects, making it difficult to attribute feedback to specific abilities. In addition, the same advantage is assigned uniformly across all tokens in response, which hides the contribution of each token from its corresponding rewards. Appendix provides simple example illustrating this limitation. To overcome these limitations, we propose TokenAdv, token-selective credit assignment for fine-grained token-level advantage estimation. Instead of summing up all rewards into one value for advantage estimation, we decouple advantage calculation separately for each reward type (Equation 4). In our case, since the outputs for answering and temporal grounding are explicitly formatted with task-specific tokens, it is feasible to distinguish the contribution of corresponding tokens to each aspect. Specifically, the token-level advantage is computed by averaging the relevant task-specific advantages for each token (Equation 5). This design allows the model to attribute feedback to specific rewards, improving its ability to learn from diverse, multi-faceted signals. 6 Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in 𝐴𝑘 𝑖 = 𝐴𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑖 mean({𝑟𝑘 𝑟𝑘 𝑖 }𝐺 std({𝑟𝑘 𝑖 }𝐺 𝑖=1) 𝑖=1) , 𝑟𝑘 {𝑅format, 𝑅Acc, 𝑅Zoom, 𝑅IoU} { mean(𝐴format mean(𝐴format 𝑖 𝑖 , 𝐴Zoom 𝑖 , 𝐴Zoom 𝑖 , 𝐴IoU 𝑖 , 𝐴Acc 𝑖 ) ) if 𝑜𝑖,𝑡 <glue> </glue> else (4) (5) By selectively assigning credits to task-specific tokens, we guide policy gradient updates toward the most influential parts of the output for each capability. This targeted credit assignment allows the model to effectively leverage diverse reward signals, leading to improved temporal grounding and question-answering performance, as shown in Figure 4. 5. Experiments 5.1. Experimental Setups Benchmarks and Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate on three GVQA benchmarks: NExT-GQA (Xiao et al., 2024), ReXTime (Chen et al., 2024), and CG-Bench (Chen et al., 2025). Temporal grounding is measured by mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), R@0.3 (IoU > 0.3), and R@0.5 (IoU > 0.5); video understanding by multiplechoice question (MCQ) accuracy; Acc@GQA measures the percentages of questions that are correctly answered and visually grounded, i.e., IoP 0.5, where IoP is the intersection over prediction span. CG-Bench (Chen et al., 2025), long-form GQA benchmark, additionally introduces two metrics rec.@IoU and acc.@IoU: rec.@IoU averages recall over IoU thresholds {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} to estimate the probability of correctly retrieving clue intervals; acc.@IoU counts response as correct only if the predicted answer is accurate and its IoU exceeds the threshold, and is averaged over the same thresholds per the original protocol. We also assess general video understanding on four long-video benchmarks, VideoMME (Fu et al., 2025), MLVU (Zhou et al., 2025), LVBench (Wang et al., 2024) and CG-Bench (Chen et al., 2025), and report MCQ accuracy. Baselines. We compare our approach with several strong baselines, including SFT-based LVLMs with grounding capability such as VTimeLLM (Huang et al., 2024), TimeChat (Ren et al., 2024) and Grounded-VideoLLM (Wang et al., 2025), RL-based methods VideoChat-TPO (Li et al., 2025), TVG-R1 (Chen et al., 2025) VideoChat-R1 (Li et al., 2025) as well as general-purpose LVLMs such as LLaVA-OneVision (Li et al., 2024), Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) and InternVL2.5 (Chen et al., 2024). All open-sourced models are of comparable scale (7B or 8B). All SFT-based models are evaluated in zero-shot setting on NExT-GQA (Xiao et al., 2024). RL methods, VideoChat-R1 (Li et al., 2025), and our model are trained on the NExT-GQA val split. For ReXTime (Chen et al., 2024) (Table 1, right) and CG-Bench (Chen et al., 2025) (Table 2, rightmost), all models are evaluated strictly in the zero-shot setting, ensuring valid and fair comparison across methods. Training Details. We adopt Qwen2.5-VL-7B (Bai et al., 2025) as the base model. The maximum number of video tokens is set to 8192, with videos sampled at 1 fps during training. The minimum video frame resolution is 16 28 28 pixels and the maximum is 768 28 28, allowing the number of tokens per frame to be adaptively adjusted under the video context budget. The maximum response length is capped at 512 tokens. The statistics of training data are shown in Appendix and Table 7. All experiments are performed on NVIDIA A100 GPUs (80GB), with global batch size of 64. Further implementation details are provided in the Appendix B. 5.2. Main Results Grounded Video Question Answering. We evaluate grounded video question answering on NExT-GQA (Xiao et al., 2024) and ReXTime (Chen et al., 2024), reporting both answer accuracy and temporal grounding quality as shown in Table 1. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics on both benchmarks, surpassing strong RL-based baselines such as VideoChat-R1 (Li et al., 2025). Notably, on NExT-GQA (Xiao et al., 7 Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Table 1: Grounded video question answering results on NExT-GQA (Xiao et al., 2024) and ReXTime (Chen et al., 2024).

On ReXTime (Chen et al., 2024), our model also consistently yields an average improvement of 4.6% across all metrics. We also report GQA performance on the challenging CG-Bench (Chen et al., 2025) in Table 2, which contains very long videos where the answer-supporting clue typically occupies 1% of the total duration. Beyond IoU, we evaluate how well the predicted segment covers the ground-truth clue span using Intersection-over-Ground truth (IoG; see Appendix D.1). As shown in Table 3, our model achieves 7.7% gain of mIoG over the runner-up, validating that the zoom-in accuracy reward 𝑅Zoom encourages predictions that not only localize the relevant temporal segments but also better cover the most salient frames containing key visual cues. Long Video Understanding. We compare against general-purpose LVLMs with temporal grounding capability and RL-based models explicitly optimized for grounding (TVG-R1 (Chen et al., 2025), VideoChat-R1 (Li et al., 2025)). While RL approaches that prioritize grounding can trade off general GQA accuracy, our method proposes token-selective credit assignment that decouples reward signals from answer accuracy and temporal grounding, assigning credit to the appropriate tokens. This mitigates the accuracygrounding trade-off and yields stronger temporal localization without degrading question answering, as shown in Table 2. Qualitative Results. We provide qualitative results in Figs. 5 to 8 in the Appendix to demonstrate the models performance on the GVQA task. For example, as shown in Figure 5, the model can localize each event mentioned in the question and arrange them in the correct chronological order. 5.3. Long Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in The above experiments demonstrate our models ability to answer questions while faithfully localizing relevant video segments. Although our primary goal is to enhance GVQA, we further present two strategies that further benefit long-video understanding through temporal zoom-in. Coarse-to-Fine. In long-video scenarios, we first let the model trade spatial resolution for broad temporal coverage to obtain global overview. Once it has coarse understanding and localizes the query-relevant interval, we enable fine-grained pass at higher spatial resolution for frames of interest as mentioned in Section 4.1. As Table 4 (Coarse-to-fine) shows, it consistently improves performance by providing targeted visual verification on small set of salient frames with higher spatial resolution, thus enhancing fine-grained understanding. We provide spatial and temporal resolution before and after zoom-in in Table 13 and qualitative results in Figs. 9 to 11 in the Appendix. 8 Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Table 2: Performance on long video understanding (VideoMME (Fu et al., 2025), MLVU (Zhou et al., 2025), LVBench (Wang et al., 2024)) and long GVQA (CG-Bench (Chen et al., 2025)) tasks.

Another strategy is to partition long video into non-overlapping windows and perform temporal search over them. For each window, the model predicts query-relevant temporal span and an answer. We then aggregate frames from spans with high-confidence answers and apply fine-grained zoom-in. Answer confidence is computed as the probability of the predicted answer token, where 𝑐 = 𝑝𝜋𝜃 (𝑡) for token 𝑡 strictly between <answer> and </answer>. We select the top spans based on answer confidence and aggregate those frames as input to obtain the final answer. As shown in Table 4 (Divide-and-conquer), it yields an average +6.4% improvement over the baseline Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025). Please refer to Appendix D.3 for ablation studies on the window size and the number of aggregated predicted temporal spans. 5.4. Ablation Studies Impact of Each Component. As shown in Table 5, introducing TokenAdv improves grounding performance over baseline GRPO, i.e., NExT-GQA mIoU 35.336.9; ReXTime mIoU 39.241.5. The zoom-in reward further boosts answer quality and grounding with larger gains in accuracy (+1.9) on ReXTime over GRPO. Combining both components yields the best performance across all metrics: NExT-GQA accuracy (+1.1) and mIoU (+2.3); ReXTime accuracy (+3.7) and mIoU (+4.0), which proves that the selective credit assignment and zoom-in verification enhance both temporal localization and evidence-faithful answering.

NExT-GQA. We observe that shorter ground-truth spans or smaller clue portions make temporal grounding more challenging. Nevertheless, our method consistently improves over the base GRPO across all ranges, demonstrating stronger robustness to temporal variations. 5.5. Computation Analysis Training computation. By using 8A100 GPUs with global batch size of 64, we measure the average per-step training time and TFLOPs. Without the temporal zoom-in paradigm, each step takes 13.29 minutes and consumes 551.2 TFLOPs. Incorporating the temporal zoom-in strategy increases the per-step time to 15.30 minutes and TFLOPs to 585.4, representing 1.15 increase in training time per step. Inference speed analysis. We provide clearer breakdown of the effectivenesslatency trade-off in the table below, and report three inference scenarios in Table 6 (i) One-stage inference: Zoom-Zero (second row) uses the same one-stage inference pipeline as the baseline, resulting in nearly identical inference time (it might vary little due to the number of generated tokens). Trained with our proposed method, this setting yields an average improvement of +1.0 over the baseline without introducing additional latency. Please kindly note that the main experimental results as shown in Table 1 and Table 2 only have one-stage inference. (ii) Two-stage inference (Coarse-to-fine): The coarse-to-fine variant adds fine-grained pass on grounded frames. This introduces moderate increase in computation, approximately 1.4 inference time, while delivering higher average absolute improvement of +2.1 over the baseline. (iii) Two-stage inference (Divide-and-conquer): The divide-and-conquer scheme is an optional test-time scaling strategy designed to further push performance. While it increases inference time to around 2.3, it also achieves the largest gain, improving the baseline by +4.3 on average. 6. Conclusion We introduce Zoom-Zero, coarse-to-fine framework for grounded video question answering that first localizes query-relevant segments, then zooms into salient frames to capture fine-grained details. Our approach enhances GRPO for GVQA with two key contributions: (i) zoom-in accuracy reward for evidence-faithful temporal grounding and fine-grained visual verification, and (ii) token-selective credit assignment for advantage Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Table 6: Trade-off between inference speed and accuracy gain.

For the QVHighlights (Lei et al., 2021) training split, which contains 9,996 examples, we only keep videos longer than 120 seconds. For the PLM-Video (Cho et al., 2025) multiple-choice split, we perform quality check to remove examples that cannot be correctly answered using the full video, but can be correctly answered when restricted to the cropped segment defined by the clue duration. This ensures that the clue duration indeed provides sufficient information for identifying the correct video segment. After Stage training, we employ the model trained from Stage for offline data filtering. Specifically, we generate 𝑛 = 8 responses per example and discard those without meaningful reward signals. For questionanswering ability, we exclude examples for which all generated responses answer the question correctly, as they lack discriminative signals. For temporal grounding ability, we filter out examples with low response variance. In particular, we retain only examples where the responses yield sufficiently strong relative reward signal, quantified by the difference between the maximum IoU and the mean IoU across responses: 𝛿 = max 1𝑖𝑛 IoU𝑖 1 𝑛 𝑛 𝑖=1 IoU𝑖 (6) We filter out examples with 𝛿 < 0.1.

The maximum number of video tokens is set to 8,192, with videos sampled at 1 fps during training. The minimum video frame resolution is 16 28 28 pixels, and the maximum is 768 28 28, allowing the number of tokens per frame to be adaptively adjusted under the video context budget. The maximum response length is capped at 512 tokens. Due to computational resource limitations, we conduct RL training in two stages. In the first stage, we train on 20K short-video GQA examples from NExT-GQA (Xiao et al., 2024), ActivityNet (Krishna et al., 2017), and QVHighlights (Lei et al., 2021). In the second stage, we train on the yt1b_mcqa split from PLM-Video (Cho et al., 2025), combined with the short-video data sampled from the first stage, for total of 7K examples. The statistics of training data are shown in Appendix and Table 7. All experiments are performed on NVIDIA A100 GPUs (80GB), with global batch size of 64. During inference, we evaluate all models at 1 FPS with context size of 8,192 on the short-video benchmarks NExT-GQA (Xiao et al., 2024) and ReXTime (Chen et al., 2024). For long-video benchmarks: CG-Bench (Chen et al., 2025), VideoMME (Fu et al., 2025), MLVU (Zhou et al., 2025), and LVBench (Wang et al., 2024). We also uniformly sampled maximum of 256 frames and set the context size to 16,384. Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Table 8: simple example to demonstrate the GRPOs uniform credit assignment problem.

Limitation of GRPO in Uniform Credit Assignment In Table 8, we present simple example with two rewards, 𝑅IoU and 𝑅Acc, across five responses to illustrate the limitations of GRPO arising from naïve reward summation and uniform credit assignment. For example, the first response attains the lowest temporal grounding reward, 𝑅(1) IoU = 0, yet its overall advantage under standard GRPO is positive, 𝐴(1) Sum = +0.06. In contrast, response 4 achieves much better temporal grounding, 𝑅(4) Sum = 0.58. Due to uniform credit assignment, all tokens in response 1 are reinforced by the positive advantage, while all tokens in response 4 are penalized. This hides the contribution of tokens that support more accurate temporal grounding. IoU = 0.8, but receives lower advantage, 𝐴(4) In contrast, computing separate advantages for each reward, 𝐴IoU and 𝐴Acc, provides clearer view of each tasks contribution. By selectively assigning these decoupled advantages to the corresponding tokens, our approach TokenAdv, updates the policy to increase the probability of tokens that positively impact their respective tasks. D. Experiments D.1. Temporal Grounding Coverage In addition to IoU, we evaluate how well the predicted segment covers the ground-truth clue span using Intersection-over-Ground truth (IoG), defined as IoG = ℐpredℐgt , where ℐpred is the predicted temporal span and ℐgt is the ground-truth clue span. We report mean IoG (mIoG) as the average IoG across instances. IoG directly measures coverage of the ground truth and thus verifies whether temporal grounding captures the key frames relevant to the query, particularly informative for the finer-grained zoom-in. ℐgt We present results in Table 3. For ReXTime (Chen et al., 2024), only IoU and accuracy are available via server-side evaluation, and the ground-truth clue spans are not released; consequently, we compute and report mIoG on the validation set for comparison. Our model improves mIoG by 1.2% on NExT-GQA (Xiao et al., 2024) and by 3.3% on ReXTime (Chen et al., 2024). For very long videos such as CG-Bench (Chen et al., 2025), mIoU can be less informative because the larger denominator depresses scores. Considering both mIoU and mIoG shows that our model not only localizes the relevant moments but also achieves strong coverage of key frames. D.2. The number of generated responses We investigate the impact of the number of generated responses 𝐺 per prompt during GRPO training, as this hyperparameter directly influences the diversity and quality of the policy optimization process. As presented in Table 9, increasing 𝐺 from 2 to 8 consistently improves performance across both datasets and all evaluation metrics. Based on these results, we adopt 𝐺 = 8 for all main experiments, as it provides the optimal balance between computational efficiency and performance gains. 13 Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Table 9: Ablation on the number of generated responses 𝐺 per prompt during GRPO training.

Divide-and-Conquer We study the impact of window size  (Table 10)  and the number of predicted temporal spans aggregated in the divide-and-conquer strategy. Because this approach requires scanning every sliding window during the coarse-grained pass, it introduces an average 2.3 increase in inference cost. Nevertheless, it improves performance across all long-video benchmarks by an average of +6.4%, demonstrating that our temporal zoom-in with higher spatial resolution provides substantial benefits for long video understanding.

Coarse-to-fine Video understanding on GVQA We further evaluate short-form GVQA answer accuracy on NExT-GQA and ReXTime through temporal zoom-in, as reported in Table 12. Both benchmarks consist of short videos, where the model can preserve most temporal context and details within the context budget. In this setting, the zoom-in paradigm improves performance by 0.7% on NExT-GQA and 0.8% on ReXTime. E. Limitation and Future Direction Our current approach performs only single round of zoom-in during both training and inference. We did not explore iterative or recursive zooming due to computational constraints. However, multi-stage zooming could further refine temporal grounding by progressively narrowing the search space and focusing on increasingly fine-grained visual cues. 14 Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Figure 3: Temporal grounding robustness analysis on NExT-GQA.

Another limitation is that the zoom-in process is enforced rather than adaptive. Ideally, the model itself should decide whether, when, and how many times to zoom in, guided by the task objective. goal-oriented, multi-step zooming policy could potentially yield more efficient and faithful grounding. If strong pretrained model with reasonable temporal grounding ability and exploration samples is sufficient, our framework could also be trained without explicit temporal interval annotations. Instead of relying on rule-based reward, i.e., 𝑅IoU, the model could learn to verify whether key visual clues exist within its predicted temporal segments. This self-verification mechanism has the potential to mutually enhance answer accuracy and temporal grounding, especially in long-video scenarios where temporal annotations are often scarce to obtain. 15 Zoom-Zero: Reinforced Coarse-to-Fine Video Understanding via Temporal Zoom-in Table 13: Spatial and temporal resolution in coarse-to-fine video understanding."
