            "title": "1 Introduction\nLaplacian growth represents a fundamental class of non-equilibrium pattern formation where the interface velocity\nis driven by the gradient of a scalar field satisfying ∇2ϕ = 0 [35, 32]. Unlike equilibrium crystal growth controlled\nby local surface tension and attachment kinetics, Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) is governed by a non-\nlocal instability: the “screening” of the harmonic measure. As the aggregate expands, the probability flux of\nincoming random walkers concentrates at the tips of protrusions, exponentially starving the interior fjords [8].\nThis stochastic shadowing prevents the formation of a compact bulk, generating a scale-invariant structure with\na fractal dimension Df ≈ 1.71 in two dimensions [36, 31].",
            "content": "Investigating the asymptotic scaling of these aggregates requires large ensembles to escape finite-size transient regimes. Historically, the computational cost of tracking millions of stochastic trajectories necessitated rigid implementations in statically compiled languages like Fortran or C. While the modern scientific computing stack has largely migrated to high-level dynamic ecosystems [13], the interpretative overhead of the core random-walk loop remains prohibitive for large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. This creates technical friction between the flexibility required for complex data analysis and the raw throughput needed for statistical convergence. We resolve this performance bottleneck using just-in-time (JIT) compilation via the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)-based Numba architecture [19]. By compiling the stochastic trajectory logic to optimized machine code at runtime, we achieve execution speeds comparable to legacy Fortran or solvers without exiting the Python environment. We utilize this implementation to probe the structural limits of DLA beyond simple mass-radius scaling. Specifically, we analyze the breakdown of scale invariance through the generalized Renyi dimension spectrum [12, 7] and quantify spatial heterogeneity via lacunarity analysis [26]. Furthermore, we characterize the finite-density phase transition, observing the crossover from the fractal DLA regime to the compact Eden model [4] as the walker mean free path becomes comparable to the aggregate screening length [24, 3]."

We present here a formulation of the DLA process on a\ntwo-dimensional square lattice Z2.",
            "content": "1 (2) (3) (4) Consider lattice of linear dimension , where each site = (i, j) with i, {0, 1, . . . , 1} admits one of three states: empty, occupied by mobile particle (walker), or occupied by an immobile aggregate particle. The aggregate grows through the sequential deposition of walkers executing unbiased random walks until contact with the existing cluster. The stochastic dynamics of single walker proceeds as follows. Let r(t) Z2 denote the walker position at discrete time t. The walker transitions to one of the four nearest-neighbour sites with equal probability, (cid:0)r(t + 1) = r(t) + eα (cid:1) = 1 4 , α {1, 2, 3, 4}, (1) where e1 = (1, 0), e2 = (1, 0), e3 = (0, 1), and e4 = (0, 1) are the unit lattice vectors. This prescription defines an isotropic random walk on Z2. To establish the connection with continuum diffusion, we invoke the master equation for the probability density ρ(r, t) of finding the walker at position at time t. From Eq. (1), one obtains ρ(r, + 1) = 1 4 4 (cid:88) α=1 ρ(r eα, t). Subtracting ρ(r, t) from both sides of Eq. (2) and recognising the discrete Laplacian operator 2 defined by 2 dρ(r) = 4 (cid:88) α=1 ρ(r + eα) 4ρ(r), we rewrite Eq. (2) as ρ(r, + 1) ρ(r, t) = 1 2 dρ(r, t). In the continuum limit where the lattice spacing 0 and the time step 0 with = a2/(4t) held fixed, Eq. (4) converges to the diffusion equation ρ = D2ρ, (5) where is the diffusion coefficient. The DLA model thus describes growth limited by diffusive transport of particles toward the aggregate surface [36]. The aggregation rule completes the model specification. Let A(t) Z2 denote the set of lattice sites occupied by the aggregate at time t. walker at position r(t) irreversibly joins the aggregate if any of its nearest neighbours belongs to A(t), (6) This instantaneous sticking corresponds to the limit of infinite surface reaction rate, characteristic of transportlimited growth [23]. if α : r(t) + eα A(t). r(t) A(t + 1) The aggregate morphology exhibits statistical self-similarity over range of length scales, quantified by the fractal dimension Df . For cluster centred at rc, we define the mass (R) enclosed within radius as (cid:88) (R) = Θ(cid:0)R rc(cid:1), where Θ() denotes the Heaviside step function. For fractal object, (R) scales as power law, rA (R) RDf , (7) (8) where Df is the fractal dimension. Taking logarithms of both sides of Eq. (8) yields log (R) = Df log + const, (9) permitting extraction of Df via linear regression in the scaling regime. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations establish Df 1.71 for two-dimensional DLA [35, 31], value intermediate between line (Df = 1) and compact disk (Df = 2), reflecting the ramified, dendritic character of DLA clusters. The screening effect underlies the fractal morphology. Walkers approaching the aggregate preferentially contact the tips of protruding branches, which intercept diffusing particles before they can penetrate the fjords. This positive feedback amplifies initial perturbations, generating the characteristic dendritic structure. Quantitatively, the growth probability p(r) at surface site satisfies p(r) ϕ(r), where ϕ is the solution to Laplaces equation 2ϕ = 0 exterior to the aggregate with appropriate boundary conditions [8]."

            "content": "The lattice state is encoded in an integer array Gij {0, 1, 2} for i, {0, 1, . . . , 1}, where Gij = 0 denotes an empty site, Gij = 1 mobile walker, and Gij = 2 an immobile aggregate particle. The simulation proceeds by evolving Nw walkers simultaneously until all have joined the aggregate or maximum iteration count 2 is exceeded. The random walk dynamics prescribed by Eq. (1) is implemented through the following update rule. At each discrete time step, every mobile walker selects direction α {1, 2, 3, 4} uniformly at random. The candidate position = (i, j) is computed from the current position = (i, j) via where (δx Eq. (10) enforces periodic boundary conditions, mapping coordinates outside [0, 1] back onto the lattice. 1 ) = (1, 0), (δx = (i + δx 2 ) = (1, 0), (δx α) mod N, 3 , δy = (j + δy 3 ) = (0, 1), and (δx α) mod N, 4 , δy (10) 4 ) = (0, 1). The modular arithmetic in 1 , δy 2 , δy Prior to executing the move, the algorithm evaluates the sticking condition of Eq. (6). For the candidate position r, we examine all four nearest neighbours, (r) = (cid:8)((i + δx α) mod N, (j + δy α) mod ) : α = 1, 2, 3, 4(cid:9), (11) and test whether any site in (r) satisfies = 2. If an aggregate neighbour exists, the walker irreversibly deposits at by setting Gij = 2 and removing the walker from the mobile population. Otherwise, the walker advances to provided that site is unoccupied; if Gij = 1, the move is rejected and the walker remains at r. crucial algorithmic enhancement addresses the computational inefficiency arising from walkers that wander far from the aggregate. Such particles contribute negligibly to growth while consuming computational resources. We introduce re-injection mechanism whereby walkers exceeding an age threshold τmax steps since their last injection are repositioned near the aggregate boundary. The threshold scales linearly with the lattice dimension, τmax = 2N , reflecting the characteristic diffusion time τ L2/D for exploration of region of linear extent L. Re-injected walkers are placed within bounding box surrounding the current aggregate, computed dynamically as the cluster grows. The simulation supports two distinct injection geometries. In the random injection mode, walkers are initialised at positions drawn uniformly from the lattice, excluding sites already occupied by the aggregate. In the radial injection mode, walkers are placed on circle of radius Rinj centred at the lattice midpoint rc = (N/2, N/2). The initial position (i0, j0) for radially injected walker is (cid:22) 2 + Rinj cos θ + Rinj sin θ (cid:22) 2 mod N, mod N, j0 = i0 = (12) (cid:23) (cid:23) where θ [0, 2π) is sampled uniformly and denotes the floor function. Radial injection produces more isotropic growth patterns by ensuring walkers approach the aggregate from all directions with equal probability, approximating the boundary conditions of the continuum Laplacian growth problem [11]. The fractal dimension is extracted numerically from the mass-radius relation of Eq. (8). We compute (R) for logarithmically spaced sequence of radii {Rk}nR k=1 spanning from Rmin 3 lattice units to Rmax = 0.8 min(N/2, rgyration), where rgyration is the radius of gyration of the aggregate. The mass within radius Rk is obtained by direct enumeration, (Rk) = 1 (cid:88) 1 (cid:88) i=0 j=0 Gij δGij ,2 Θ(cid:0)R2 (i ic)2 (j jc)2(cid:1), (13) where (ic, jc) is the aggregate centroid and δGij ,2 is the Kronecker delta selecting aggregate sites. Linear regression of log (Rk) against log Rk in accordance with Eq. (9) yields the fractal dimension Df as the slope. Data points with (Rk) < 10 are excluded to mitigate small-number statistical fluctuations. We validate the implementation through four test configurations spanning distinct physical regimes. The first configuration, termed the classic DLA case, employs single seed particle at the lattice centre with Nw = 104 walkers injected randomly. This canonical setup reproduces the original Witten-Sander protocol [35] and serves as baseline for fractal dimension estimation. Growth proceeds radially outward from the seed, generating single connected dendritic structure with the characteristic screening-induced branching. The second configuration investigates competitive growth from multiple nucleation sites. Twelve seed particles are distributed randomly across the lattice, and Nw = 1.5 104 walkers aggregate onto these seeds. The resulting dynamics exhibit inter-cluster competition: aggregates compete for the diffusing particle flux, with larger clusters screening smaller neighbours and eventually dominating the growth. This configuration probes aggregate coalescence and the late-time approach to single connected structure, phenomena relevant to polycrystalline thin-film deposition [6]. The third configuration employs radial injection with Rinj = 180 lattice units to examine controlled growth conditions. single central seed receives Nw = 104 walkers injected according to Eq. (12). The fixed injection radius establishes well-defined outer boundary, ensuring that particles approach the aggregate through predominantly radial diffusion field. This geometry more closely approximates the theoretical DLA limit of particles released from infinity and permits cleaner extraction of the fractal dimension by suppressing anisotropies induced by rectangular lattice boundaries. The fourth configuration explores the high-density regime with Nw = 2.5104 walkers aggregating onto single central seed. The elevated particle count probes finite-density effects wherein the dilute-walker approximation underlying the standard DLA model begins to fail. At sufficiently high walker concentrations, inter-particle correlations modify the effective diffusion field, potentially altering the growth morphology and fractal dimension. This configuration also stress-tests the numerical implementation at extended simulation times, as the larger aggregate requires correspondingly more iterations to complete. All simulations employ lattice of = 512 sites per dimension, providing adequate resolution to observe scaling behaviour over approximately two decades in length scale. Snapshots of the aggregate configuration are recorded at regular intervals during growth, enabling subsequent visualisation and time-resolved analysis. The simulation outputs are stored in Network Common Data Format (NetCDF) [28], self-describing binary format providing efficient compression and metadata preservation, with compression, preserving the full spatiotemporal evolution for post-processing. The complete implementation is available as the dla-ideal-solver library, providing both command-line interface for batch execution and Python application programming interface for programmatic access. Numbas JIT [19] of the inner random-walk loop achieves approximately two orders of magnitude speedup relative to pure Python, while parallel rendering of animation frames via the multiprocessing module exploits multi-core architectures for efficient visualisation [15, 14]."

Confidence intervals are obtained via nonparametric bootstrap resampling [5]: we draw = 1000 samples with replacement from the (log Rk, log Mk) pairs, compute ˆD(b) for each resample {1, . . . , B}, and extract the 95% confidence interval from the empirical quantiles of { ˆD(b) }. Growth dynamics are characterized by the temporal evolution of the aggregate mass (t), where indexes discrete snapshots. For diffusion-limited growth, dimensional analysis yields the scaling relation (t) tα, α = Df 2 , (15) reflecting the diffusive scaling t1/2 combined with (8). For two-dimensional DLA with Df 1.71, we expect α 0.855. The instantaneous growth rate dN/dt is computed via central finite differences and smoothed using SavitzkyGolay filter [29] with window length 11 and polynomial order 3, preserving higher moments of the signal while suppressing high-frequency noise. Temporal correlations in the growth rate are assessed via the sample autocorrelation function ˆρ(k) = (cid:80)T t=1 (rt r)(rt+k r) t=1(rt r)2 (cid:80)T , where rt = dN/dtt and is the total number of snapshots. The LjungBox portmanteau statistic [21] QK = (T + 2) (cid:88) k=1 ˆρ(k)2 (16) (17) tests the null hypothesis that the first autocorrelations are jointly zero; under H0, QK χ2 K. Multiscale structure is quantified through the generalized dimension spectrum [12, 7]. We partition the lattice into non-overlapping boxes of linear size ε and compute the box mass mi(ε) as the number of aggregate particles in box i. The probability measure is pi(ε) = mi(ε)/Ntotal. The box-counting dimension D0 follows from counting the number (ε) of occupied boxes: (ε) εD0 D0 = lim ε0 log (ε) log ε . The information dimension D1 derives from the Shannon entropy [30] H(ε) = (cid:88) pi(ε) log2 pi(ε), (18) (19) which scales as H(ε) D1 log2(1/ε) for small ε. More generally, the Renyi entropy of order [27] is defined as Hq(ε) = 1 1 log (cid:32) (cid:88) (cid:33) pi(ε)q , with the Shannon entropy recovered in the limit 1. The generalized dimension of order is Dq = lim ε0 Hq(ε) log2(1/ε) . The correlation dimension D2 corresponds to = 2 and characterizes pair correlations within the aggregate. For monofractal structures such as DLA, the dimension spectrum is degenerate: D0 D1 D2 Df . (20) (21) Spatial heterogeneity is further characterized by the lacunarity [1, 26] Λ(ε) = m2ε m2 ε 1, (22) where ε denotes averaging over all boxes at scale ε. Lacunarity quantifies the gappiness of the structure: Λ = 0 for homogeneous distribution, while Λ > 0 indicates clustering. DLA aggregates exhibit scale-dependent lacunarity reflecting the hierarchical branching structure. Statistical comparisons across experimental configurations employ the KruskalWallis H-test [18], nonparametric analogue of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing for differences in central tendency among groups: = 12 n(n + 1) (cid:88) j=1 R2 nj 3(n + 1), (23) where = (cid:80) the null hypothesis of identical distributions, χ2 nj is the total sample size, nj is the size of group j, and Rj is the sum of ranks in group j.

Rows correspond to: (ac) classic DLA with single central seed; (df) multiple seeds with 12 randomly distributed nucleation sites; (gi) radial injection from fixed radius Rinj = 180; (jl) high density with Nw = 25,000 walkers. Columns represent early (10%), middle (50%), and final (100%) growth stages. Particle counts and completion percentages are indicated in each panel. Color encodes radial distance from aggregate centroid (dark red: center; bright orange: tips). Lattice size 512 512 for all cases. Figure 1 presents spatiotemporal snapshots of aggregate growth across the four test configurations, with columns corresponding to early (10%), middle (50%), and final (100%) growth stages. The classic DLA configuration (panels ac) exhibits the characteristic dendritic morphology with radially symmetric branching emanating from the central seed. At 50% completion (N = 4,974 particles), the aggregate has attained maximum radius Rmax = 70.77 lattice units with radius of gyration Rg = 41.58; by completion (N = 10,000), these values increase to Rmax = 108.25 and Rg = 58.66. The compactness parameter = N/(πR2 max) decreases from 0.28 at mid-growth to 0.24 at completion, reflecting the increasingly ramified structure as screening effects amplify tip growth over fjord filling [8]. The multiple seeds configuration (panels df in Fig. 1) produces qualitatively different morphology. Twelve randomly distributed seeds nucleate independent aggregates that grow competitively, each screening its neighbours from the diffusing walker flux. The final state comprises 66 distinct connected componentsthe initial 12 seeds have fragmented into smaller isolated clusters through the periodic boundary conditions. The reported fractal dimension Df = 2.56 from the mass-radius analysis is spurious: it reflects the space-filling distribution of disconnected clusters rather than the intrinsic scaling of individual aggregates. This configuration violates the single-connected-aggregate assumption underlying (8) and demonstrates the importance of appropriate analysis methods for multi-nucleation scenarios [33, 17]. 6 The radial injection configuration (panels gi in Fig. 1) yields morphology visually similar to classic DLA but with subtly enhanced isotropy. The fixed injection radius establishes well-defined outer boundary condition approximating the theoretical limit of particles released from infinity [11]. The final aggregate (N = 9,994; six walkers failed to aggregate within the iteration limit) exhibits Rmax = 111.99 and aspect ratio 1.04, compared to 1.02 for classic DLA, indicating marginally more anisotropic growth. This counterintuitive result likely reflects statistical fluctuation rather than systematic bias, as both values are consistent with isotropic growth within measurement uncertainty. The high density configuration (panels jl in Fig. 1) demonstrates the effect of elevated walker concentration on aggregate morphology. With Nw = 25,000 walkers2.5 times the classic casethe aggregate grows more compactly, achieving Rmax = 148.39 at completion with compactness = 0.29. The denser structure reflects reduced screening effectiveness: at high walker concentrations, multiple particles may approach the aggregate surface simultaneously, partially filling fjords that would remain empty under dilute conditions [24, 3]. This finite-density effect shifts the growth dynamics toward the Eden model limit [4], where all surface sites grow with equal probability. Figure 2: Mass-radius scaling analysis for fractal dimension extraction. (a) Classic DLA: Df = 1.711 0.080, R2 = 0.9875. (b) Radial injection: Df = 1.713 0.077, R2 = 0.9854. (c) High density: Df = 1.870 0.055, R2 = 0.9950. Circles denote simulation data; solid red lines show linear regression fits; shaded bands indicate 95% confidence intervals; dashed teal lines represent the theoretical prediction Df = 1.71. The multiple seeds case is excluded as mass-radius analysis requires single connected aggregate. Data filtered to (R) > 10 and < 0.8Rmax to exclude boundary effects and small-number fluctuations. Figure 2 displays the mass-radius scaling analysis for the three single-aggregate configurations (Cases 1, 3, and 4); the multiple seeds case is excluded as discussed above. For classic DLA (panel of Fig. 2), linear regression in log-log coordinates yields Df = 1.7105 0.0801 with coefficient of determination R2 = 0.9875. This value agrees remarkably well with the theoretical prediction Df = 1.71 0.01 [35, 31]: the deviation Df 1.71 = 0.0005 corresponds to relative error of 0.03%, and the z-score of 0.02 yields = 0.99 for the null hypothesis Df = 1.71. The radial injection case (panel of Fig. 2) shows equally excellent agreement: Df = 1.7126 0.0772 (R2 = 0.9854), with deviation 0.0026 (0.15% relative error, = 0.93). The consistency between random and radial injection modes confirms that both adequately approximate the diffusion-limited transport regime. The high density case (panel of Fig. 2) exhibits significant deviation from theory: Df = 1.8697 0.0554 (R2 = 0.9950), exceeding the theoretical value by 0.16 (9.3% relative). The z-score of 8.12 strongly rejects consistency with Df = 1.71 (p < 1015). This elevated fractal dimension reflects the finite-density crossover discussed above: as walker concentration increases, the effective growth probability becomes less sharply peaked at branch tips, producing more compact structures with Df approaching the Eden limit of 2 [24]. The high R2 value indicates that the aggregate remains self-similar despite the modified scaling exponent, confirming that finite-density effects alter the universality class rather than destroying fractal character. 7 Figure 3: Growth dynamics analysis for all four DLA configurations. (a) Cumulative particle count (t) versus snapshot index, showing characteristic decelerating growth as aggregates enlarge. (b) Instantaneous growth rate dN/dt versus particle count , demonstrating monotonic decrease due to diffusive screening. (c) Normalized growth curves (t)/Nmax versus normalized time t/T , enabling direct comparison of growth kinetics. (d) Growth efficiency N/Reff (normalized) versus t/T , where Reff = 1/Df estimates the effective aggregate radius. Legend applies to all panels. Figure 3 characterizes the temporal evolution of aggregate mass. Panel (a) of Fig. 3 shows cumulative particle counts (t) versus snapshot index for all four configurations. The curves exhibit the characteristic DLA growth pattern: initially rapid accumulation that gradually decelerates as the aggregate enlarges. The high density case achieves = 25,000 particles in 149 snapshots (mean rate 168.5 particles/snapshot), while classic DLA deposits 10,000 particles over 156 snapshots (mean rate 64.4 particles/snapshot). Panel (b) of Fig. 3 reveals that growth rate dN/dt decreases monotonically with for all cases, consistent with diffusive screening: larger aggregates present greater cross-section to incoming walkers but also more effectively shadow interior regions. The radial injection case exhibits notably steadier growth, with coefficient of variation CV = σ/µ = 12.5% compared to 34.1% (classic), 21.8% (multiple seeds), and 51.3% (high density). This reduced variability reflects the controlled injection geometry: walkers approach from all directions with equal probability, averaging over the anisotropic screening of individual branches. The high density case shows greatest variability because stochastic fluctuations in the local walker concentration produce intermittent bursts of rapid deposition followed by quiescent periods. Panel (c) of Fig. 3 displays normalized growth curves (t)/Nmax versus normalized time t/T , enabling direct comparison of growth dynamics across configurations. The curves collapse reasonably well, suggesting universal growth kinetics modulo the finite-density corrections affecting Case 4. Panel (d) of Fig. 3 shows growth efficiency N/Reff , where the effective radius is estimated via Reff = 1/Df from (8). This quantity measures mass accumulation per unit spatial extent and remains approximately constant after initial transients, confirming self-similar growth. Power-law fits to the growth curves yield exponents α in the range 1.071.10, substantially exceeding the theoretical prediction α = Df /2 0.86 from (15). This discrepancy arises because the theoretical scaling assumes walkers are released one at time from infinity, whereas our simulations evolve all Nw walkers simultaneously on finite lattice with re-injection. The effective time variable in the simulation (snapshot index) does not map linearly onto the theoretical time (number of walkers released), invalidating direct comparison of growth exponents. The LjungBox test rejects white noise for all cases (p < 1010), confirming significant temporal correlations in growth rate with characteristic correlation lengths of 36 snapshots. The KruskalWallis test yields = 463.7 (p = 3.45 10100), establishing highly significant differences in growth rate distributions across configurations. 8 Figure 4: Information-theoretic characterization of DLA aggregate structure.

(d) Information dimension D1 extraction from H(ε) versus log2(1/ε); note consistent use of log2 matching Shannon entropy definition. For monofractal structures, D0 D1 D2 Df 1.71. Figure 4 presents the information-theoretic analysis. Panel (a) of Fig. 4 shows Shannon entropy H(ε) versus box size ε on semi-logarithmic axes. All cases exhibit monotonically decreasing entropy with increasing box size, as expected: larger boxes average over more fine-scale structure, reducing the effective number of distinguishable configurations. The high density case shows highest entropy at all scales, reflecting its greater total mass and more uniform spatial distribution. The multiple seeds case shows anomalously high entropy at large scales due to the distributed cluster geometry. Panel (b) of Fig. 4 displays lacunarity Λ(ε) on log-log axes. All single-aggregate cases (1, 3, 4) exhibit similar lacunarity profiles, decreasing from Λ 10 at small scales to Λ 1 at large scales. This scale-dependent heterogeneity reflects the hierarchical branching structure: at fine scales, mass is concentrated along branch backbones with large empty regions between; at coarse scales, the aggregate appears more homogeneous. The multiple seeds case shows dramatically lower lacunarity at large scales (Λ 0.7), reflecting the space-filling distribution of disconnected clusters. Panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 4 extract the box-counting dimension D0 and information dimension D1 from loglog regression. For classic DLA, we obtain D0 = 1.665 0.031 and D1 = 1.758 0.029; for radial injection, D0 = 1.634 0.028 and D1 = 1.743 0.023. These values bracket the mass-radius dimension Df 1.71, as expected for monofractal structures where D0 D1 D2 [12]. The small spread D2 D0 0.12 confirms that DLA aggregates are approximately monofractal, lacking the strong multifractal character observed in some growth processes [2, 20]. The correlation dimension D2 = 1.783 0.032 (classic) and D2 = 1.770 0.030 (radial) complete the generalized dimension spectrum. The high density case yields systematically elevated dimensions: D0 = 1.792, D1 = 1.840, D2 = 1.865. The ordering D0 < D1 < D2 < Df and the small spread confirm monofractal scaling, but the absolute values reflect the more compact morphology discussed above. The multiple seeds case shows suppressed dimensions (D0 = 1.514, D1 = 1.580, D2 = 1.595) because the box-counting procedure measures the effective dimension of the cluster distribution rather than individual aggregate structure. This distinction underscores the importance of matching analysis methods to morphological characteristics. The overall agreement between our computed fractal dimensions and established theoretical values validates the implementation. For the two canonical configurations (classic DLA and radial injection), the mass-radius dimension deviates from Df = 1.71 by less than 0.3%, comparable to or better than published numerical studies employing similar lattice sizes [31, 25]. The generalized dimensions D0, D1, and D2 cluster within 0.05 of Df , confirming monofractal scaling consistent with theoretical expectations [9]. The observed deviations in the high density case provide quantitative evidence for finite-density corrections to DLA universality, regime that has received less systematic numerical investigation [3]."

Our analysis confirms the robustness of the standard DLA universality class (Df ≈ 1.71) under\nradial and point-source injection, yet the observed deviation in the high-density regime (Df → 1.87) serves as a\ncautionary note on the limits of the discrete-walker approximation. This drift likely indicates a physical crossover\ntoward the Eden model driven by the saturation of the screening length, rather than a mere numerical artifact.\nWhile our multifractal and lacunarity analyses offer a detailed morphological fingerprint of these aggregates, a\nrigorous renormalization group treatment of the finite-density transition remains an open theoretical challenge.\nThe software framework developed here offers a reliable, accessible testbed for addressing such questions in\nnon-equilibrium statistical mechanics.",
