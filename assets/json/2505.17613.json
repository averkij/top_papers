            "content": "As investments in multimodal generative AI grow, current models are rapidly advancing their capabilities in generating text [Achiam et al., 2023], images [Podell et al., 2024], audio [Evans et al., 2025], and their interleaved combinations [Chen et al., 2025c, Wang et al., 2024]. However, rigorous and reproducible evaluation of multimodal generation lags behind, raising critical question: how can we accurately and effectively assess the capabilities of these models? Human evaluations [Chiang et al., 2024, Saharia et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2025], while considered the gold standard, are prohibitively expensive for comprehensive assessment at scale. Moreover, inherent subjectivity makes it difficult to systematically identify specific model weaknesses, limiting targeted improvements. As an alternative, existing automated evaluation approaches face two main limitations. First, it is hard to align automatic evaluation metrics well with human judges. Most multimodal generation benchmarks [Xia et al., 2025, Chen et al., 2024b, 2025a] rely on multimodal language models as judges (MLM-as-a-judge) [Hu et al., 2023, Chen et al., 2024a] without carefully validating their reliability, potentially causing misalignment with human judgment [Chen et al., 2024a, Pu et al., 2025]. Second, most benchmarks focus solely on single modalities [Ji et al., 2024, Ghosh et al., 2023, Xie et al., 2025b], failing to capture the rich interleaved multimodal content (vision, language, speech/audio) that characterizes real-world tasks such as cross-modal reasoning [Hu et al., 2024]. equal contribution Preprint. Figure 1: Examples of tasks and their evaluation metrics in MMMG. For each task, we develop an evaluation metric using programs, models or their combinations. The tasks are either verifiable purely by programs or have big generation-evaluation gaps: generation is challenging for models, while automatic evaluations have high correlation with human judgments. We show evaluation pseudo-code for demonstration the evaluation process. To address these gaps, we introduce MMMG, new benchmark containing tasks that meet two criteria: (1) tasks that are verifiable as defined in IF-Eval [Zhou et al., 2023], where outputs can be objectively verified by programs through straightforward checks (e.g., checking if speech transcript begins with keyword by comparing the first word with the keyword), and (2) tasks with significant generation-evaluation gaps, where the generation step is challenging due to complex constraints, yet the evaluation step remains simple (e.g., generating an image of snowman without carrot nose can be challenging due to spurious correlation [Ye et al., 2024], but verifying the absence of the carrot nose can be achieved accurately by prompting VLM).

MMMG exceeds other benchmarks in the number of covered tasks and modalities while providing more reliable evaluation. MMMG includes 49 tasks (29 are newly developed) and 937 instructions across 4 modality combinationstext, image, audio, and interleaved modalitiesas depicted in Table 2. By categorizing tasks based on assessed capabilities, MMMG enables fine-grained analysis of model performance and targeted identification of weaknesses. To validate the human alignment of MMMG, we conduct human evaluation across 37 tasks674 instructions and 1886 evaluation questionswith each question assessed by three independent annotators and aggregated by majority vote. MMMG achieves an average human agreement of 94.3% with average inter-annotator agreement being 97.1%. Modality-specific agreements achieve 94.8% for image, 92.6% for audio, 95.6% for interleaved image-text, and 91.0% for interleaved audio-text, with relative improvements over prior best results by 14.2% for image, and 28.1% for interleaved image-text evaluation [Ghosh et al., 2023, Chen et al., 2025a]. We benchmark 24 open and proprietary multimodal generation models using the optimal evaluation methods identified in human studies. Partial results are shown in Figure 2; the rest are in Appendix D.2. We find that modality-unified autoregressive models (ARMs) surpass diffusion models in image generation, with GPT IMAGE [OpenAI, 2025] achieving the best accuracy of 78.3%. This indicates ARMs trained on extensive language-image datasets have stronger linguistic capabilities, enabling better instruction following and improved alignment with user intent. However, GPT IMAGE still falls short in interleaved text-image reasoning tasks for math and code, achieving only 13.1% accuracy, 3D scene transformation at 34.1%, and interleaved image editing at 48.4%. Our qualitative error analysis reveals that another ARM, GEMINI IMAGE, tends to tangle multiple images in generation, hindering accurate image-sequence and image-text pair generation. Additionally, MMMG reveals greater headroom for improvement in audio generation tasks compared to image, with top-performing models achieving accuracies of 48.7% for sound and 41.9% for music generation. Overall, MMMG provides reliable benchmark for multimodal model ranking and fine-grained capability analysis."

            "content": "Interleaved Multimodal Generation. Interleaved multimodal generation involves generating coherent content across multiple modalities simultaneously, such as visual storytelling [Huang et al., 2016, Wen et al., 2023], reference-based image editing [Chen et al., 2025b], and voice chatbots [Chu et al., 2024]. Effective models must understand multimodal inputs and produce aligned outputs across modalities. Current approaches include (1) LLM backbones with specialized decoders [Chen et al., 2025c, Xie et al., 2025a], which leverage dedicated components to render visual or audio outputs; (2) modality-unified autoregressive models [Chern et al., 2024, Hurst et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2024], processing text, visual, and acoustic tokens within single sequence model, enabling native generation of interleaved content; and (3) agent-based methods [Chen et al., 2025a], using Plan-Execute-Refine pipeline with modality-specific tools.

Please refer to Table 2 for more detailed category information. We aggregate some sub-tasks for interleaved image-text generation. GPT IMAGE beats all other models on most image generation tasks, and strongly competes other baselines in generating consistent image sequences and coherent interleaved image-text contents. frameworks for interleaved multimodal generation remain underdeveloped, particularly in accurately and automatically assessing cross-modal consistency, and instruction-following capabilities. Multimodal Generation Evaluation. Evaluating image, audio and their interleaved generation presents unique challenges that have been addressed through several approaches, each with notable limitations, including (1) using specialized visual or audio models [Ghosh et al., 2023, Xie et al., 2025b], which struggle to generalize beyond their training data [Ming et al., 2022]; (2) directly employing MLMs as evaluators [Xia et al., 2025, Chen et al., 2024b, 2025a], which often misalign with human judgments [Chen et al., 2024a]; and (3) for image evaluation particularly, leveraging visual question answering (VQA) to assess specific aspects of generated content [Hu et al., 2023, Lin et al., 2024], which declines significantly in accuracy when facing complex evaluation scenarios that require nuanced reasoning [Chen et al., 2025a]. To address these limitations, previous research incorporates extensive human preference data to enhance MLM accuracy [Xiong et al., 2024, Yao et al., 2025]. Our work is an orthogonal approach that carefully designs evaluation instructions to leverage current MLM strengths while mitigating their limitations, enabling reliable multimodal evaluation without extra training or finetuning.

We evaluate each task with the method that yields the highest human agreement. green background indicates new tasks. 5 3.1 Data Curation To guarantee high-quality instructions and reliable evaluation, we design systematic data curation pipeline consisting of three key stages. Task Creation. We begin by creating an initial pool of 76 candidate task templates. These tasks span various modality combinations and each task aims to evaluate single multimodal generation capability. The complete list of 76 tasks can be found in Appendix B.2. For each task, we conduct rigorous feasibility assessment to ensure there is at least one reliable evaluation method available either programmatic verification or literature-supported, highly human-aligned evaluation method. Based on this process, we narrow our task pool down to 55 tasks. Instruction Synthesis and Validation. We employ human-in-the-loop approach to synthesize high-quality instructions for each task. Inspired by Self-Instruct [Wang et al., 2023], we prompt GPT-4O [Hurst et al., 2024] with the task template and quality-controlled criteria to generate 10 candidate instructions per task. We then go through two-stage selection process: Quality Filtering. Initially, we remove instructions that are ambiguous (instructions with unclear or multiple interpretations), unrealistic (instructions that describe improbable or nonsensical scenarios), or redundant (instructions that closely resemble previously accepted examples). For instance, unrealistic instruction Generate an image of forest without any trees is discarded because it is semantically contradictory and unlikely to occur in actual user queries. Verifiability Assessment. For instructions passing the initial filtering stage, we sample generated outputs and verify if at least one evaluation methods yield high alignment with human judgments. This step is crucial because even models generally capable of performing given task may fail to accurately evaluate out-of-distribution variants within that domain. For example, GPT-4O can accurately count fewer than 7 objects but is prone to errors counting more than 10 objects. We then generate another 10 candidate instructions and repeat the generation and validation process continues until we gather approximately 20 high-quality instructions per task. Statistically, 1050% of generated instructions pass examination, depending on task difficulty. Postprocessing. For final quality control, we perform task-level postprocessing step to further refine our benchmark. This involves two procedures: (1) Task filtering: we recruit two independent annotators to judge if each task is realistic. We eliminate six tasks that at least one annotator judges to be unrealistic. (2) Instruction paraphrasing: To ensure linguistic diversity and prevent models from memorizing specific instruction patterns, we paraphrase all remaining instructions. Each paraphrased instruction is examined manually to verify that it is equivalent to the original instruction semantically. To this end, we ultimately collect total of 937 instructions across 49 tasks spanning 4 modality combinations. This systematic approach ensures that MMMG provides comprehensive, finegrained, and reliable evaluation framework for assessing multimodal generation capabilities. The detailed definitions and metadata of each task in MMMG can be found in Table 2. 3.2 Evaluation Method We report the evaluation method used for each task in Table 2. For more details about implementation, please refer to Appendix C.3. VLM. We employ vision language models (VLMs) for most reference-free image evaluation tasks. We do not use object detection or OCR models because VLMs demonstrate superior performance in out-of-domain scenarios. common practice to boost VLM-as-a-judge is visual question answering (VQA), where models generate verification questions and answer the questions based on images to determine if images follow given instructions. However, we find that automatically generated question-answer pairs like those in TIFA [Hu et al., 2023] often misalign with human judgment on challenging tasks. Therefore, we manually design visual questions for each instruction based on these important principles as shown in Figure 1(b): Chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves VLM performance on boolean questions. Specifically, instructing models not to output yes/no at the beginning of their responses substantially reduces hallucination which echoes findings in Zhang et al. [2024]. 6 Multiple-choice format can boost VLMs performance on object counting and spatial relationship reasoning. We hypothesize that multiple-choice questions effectively reduce the output space, thereby simplifying these tasks. For example, including an option like E. More than 6 in object counting questions can prevent miscounting errors in scenarios with numerous objects. Adding negative prompts helps alleviate visual hallucination. For instance, VLMs can easily overlook constraint such as one basketball with cube shape, whereas one basketball with cube shape instead of sphere forces the VLM to reject spherical basketball. Image Similarity. For reference-based image evaluation tasks requiring perceptual similarity, we employ DreamSim [Fu et al., 2023]. When exact matching is necessary, we use SSIM [Wang et al., 2004]. For image editing tasks, we implement dual approach: DreamSim/VQA evaluates the edited region, while SSIM assesses the unmodified areas outside it, ensuring that local editing instructions are precisely followed as shown in Figure 1(e). Audio Similarity. Research indicates that current audio language models (ALMs) cannot reliably analyze sound or music clips [Sakshi et al., 2025]. Therefore, we select ESC-50 [Piczak, 2015] and OpenMIC-2018 [Humphrey et al., 2018] as reference datasets for sound and music evaluation, and compute CLAP cosine similarity [Wu et al., 2023] with reference audio as shown in Figure 1(c). Audio Model. For specialized audio analysis, we employ several targeted models. WAVLM [Chen et al., 2022] is employed for speaker similarity verification with an empirical optimal threshold of 0.86. For speech transcription, we use Whisper [Radford et al., 2023] as shown in Figure 1(d). Gender classification in speech leverages finetuned WAV2VEC checkpoint [Fiury, 2023]. For music tempo computation, we employ BEATTHIS [Foscarin et al., 2024] for beat tracking and the beats statistics are used for music tempo computation. Program. For programmatic verification, we utilize PIL for image analysis as shown in Figure 1(a), Librosa [McFee et al., 2015] and Praat [Boersma and Van Heuven, 2001] for audio pitch, intensity, and speed analysis. For textual constraint verification, we follow the implementation of IF-Eval [Zhou et al., 2023]. We use word accuracy (WAcc) to evaluate textual similarity for visual text rendering and text-to-speech tasks which requires exact matching. Scoring. Each generation receives either similarity score or binary classification of whether all requirements in the instruction are correctly rendered following previous work setup [Ghosh et al., 2023]. We convert binary classification to numerical scores (0.0 for incorrect, 1.0 for correct) and average all generation scores within each task to obtain task-level scores, then macro-average all task scores to get the final accuracy score for the multimodal generation model."

We keep other parameters, such as guidance scale, as default values. Evaluation. We compare several evaluation methods. For image generation, we include GPT-4O, GEMINI 2.5, and QWEN2.5-VL [Bai et al., 2025] to perform VQA for evaluation. CLIPScore [Hessel et al., 2021] is found as less aligned with human judgment in previous studies [Hu et al., 2023], thus not included.

CLAPScoreaudio computes the CLAP cosine similarity with reference audio, while CLAPScoretext computes the similarity with reference audio captions.

            "title": "5 Results and Analysis",
            "content": "In this section, we first report our human alignment experiment results in 5.1, and then the benchmarking results evaluated by the most human-aligned metrics in 5.2. We also report the correlation between MMMG with real-world human preference leaderboard in 5.3. 7 Figure 3: Two prevalent failure cases observed in interleaved image-text generation tasks for GEMINI IMAGE: (1) models fail to accurately interpret the order of images in interleaved inputs; and (2) models frequently blend multiple images together, possibly due to limitations in encoding multiple images with continuous latent image representations. 5.1 Alignment with Human Judges We conduct human evaluations on 674 instructions evaluated by models. For each instruction, we randomly select two models from all models evaluated on this instruction and obtain one generation per model. Each generation is evaluated by two independent annotators, randomly selected from our pool of 20 graduate student annotators. To standardize the evaluation process and reduce subjective bias, we design specific multiple-choice questions for each instruction exemplified in Appendix C.5, thereby constraining annotators responses to fixed set of choices and ensuring high inter-annotator agreement. In cases of disagreement, third annotator determines the final annotation. In total, human studies involve 1886 evaluation questions and collect 3812 annotations. For verifiable instructions, human alignment validation is unnecessary as these tasks are designed for objective programmatic verification. Human-model and inter-human agreement measures can be found in Table 8. MMMG demonstrates high human alignment, with average best human-model agreement for image, audio, interleaved image-text, and interleaved audio-text being 0.948, 0.926, 0.956 and 0.910 respectively, calculated by selecting the method achieving the highest agreement per task and averaging across tasks. The average inter-annotator agreement remains as high as 0.971 with the worst case being 0.917. MMMG also outperforms previous best benchmark alignment significantly: agreement on image generation surpasses GenEval (0.830) by 14.2%, and Pearson correlation on interleaved image-text generation surpasses ISG-Bench (0.718) by 28.1%. Experiments show that while GPT-4O remains the most human-aligned image evaluation model with an average agreement of 0.941, GEMINI 2.5 shows superior performance on spatial relationships and editing evaluation. Open-source models like QWEN2.5-VL still have significant gap with proprietary models. For audio evaluation, even though CLAPScoretext yields satisfactory agreement of 0.926, it relies highly on the quality of reference audio, thus making it challenging for out-of-domain audio evaluation. 5.2 Benchmarking Results We benchmark models with the most aligned evaluation methods for each task. Selected model performances are illustrated in Figure 2, with complete evaluation results provided in Appendix D.2. Image Generation. ARMs outperform diffusion models on image generation tasks, with GPT IMAGE and GEMINI IMAGE achieving accuracies of 0.783 and 0.641 respectively, ranking 1st and 3rd. This indicates that ARMs with stronger linguistic capabilities can better follow instructions. However, models struggle notably when generating objects with uncommon attributes and producing pairs of objects with unusual relationships, showing average accuracies of only 0.389 and 0.422 respectively. This underscores the vulnerability of image generation models to out-of-domain instructions. Interleaved Image-Text Generation. Interleaved image-text generation poses considerable challenges, with the best-performing combination (GEMINI 2.5 + GPT IMAGE) achieving limited accuracies of 0.131 on math and coding reasoning, 0.341 on 3D scene transformations, and 0.484 on interleaved image editing. Additionally, modality-unified autoregressive models such as ANOLE and GEMINI IMAGE struggle to understand interleaved input and tend to output tangled output, highlighting their limitations compared to agent-based models as shown in Figure 3. 8 Sound and Music Generation. Current audio generation models exhibit significant reasoning limitations, achieving low average accuracies across tested models0.193 for instrument exclusion and 0.175 for sound reasoning. Volume-related tasks also demonstrate poor performance, with silence generation and intensity control reaching average accuracies of merely 0.048 and 0.085, respectively. Only MAKE-AN-AUDIO 2, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for instruction parsing, shows competence in sound reasoning, while MUSICGEN effectively manages tempo control. Audio generation models remain domain-constrained; only STABLE AUDIO and AUDIOLDM 2 can handle both sound and music generation tasks. Speech and Interleaved Speech-Text Generation. The sole inherently interleaved speech-text model, SPIRIT LM, fails entirely to follow speech generation instructions, showing zero accuracy on most tasks. Agent-based models also exhibit difficulties on tasks that require simultaneous speech understanding and generation, with average accuracies of 0.275 for speech editing. 5.3 Correlation with Real-World Leaderboard We compare the correlation of the MMMG score with the Chatbot Arena [Chiang et al., 2024] score on the text-to-image task. We take the Arena Score for 7 image generation models under the User Prompts Only category as gold reference. We report the Pearson correlation and Spearmans rank correlation coefficient between gold arena scores and scores produced by evaluating on different benchmarks in Table 3. We compare with GenEval, DrawBench, and GenAI-Bench. We employ VQAScore [Lin et al., 2024] to replace human evaluation on DrawBench and GenAI-Bench; due to budgetary limitations, we randomly sample 400 out of 1600 instructions for GenAI-Bench.

Arena, Draw, GenAI represent Chatbot Arena, DrawBench, and GenAI-Bench. MMMG achieves the highest correlation with Chatbot Arena. This indicates even though our instructions are synthetic, the evaluation results are still highly human-aligned. MMMG provides reliable model rankings with Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.857, significantly outperforming baseline benchmarks. This indicates that despite that synthetic instructions may not fully align with real-world queries, MMMG achieves higher alignment with human preferences. Such results suggest that evaluator alignment (i.e., the reliability of the evaluation method) may outweigh instruction distribution alignment (i.e., the extent to which benchmark tasks reflect real-world task distributions) for accurate model assessment. Moreover, MMMG demonstrates superior differentiation capabilities among evaluated models. The performance gap of 0.318 between the highestand lowest-ranked models is much larger than the next-best baseline (GenEval), which has only gap of 0.147. This larger range underscores MMMGs enhanced ability to distinguish among models, particularly for differentiating performance among top-tier models. Due to the lack of real-world human preference leaderboards like Chatbot Arena for other modalities, we leave human preference correlation studies for other modalities as future work."

            "content": "In this work, we introduce MMMG, comprehensive automated evaluation suite for multitask multimodal generation, addressing critical limitations of existing benchmarks. We collect 937 high-quality instructions spanning 49 diverse tasks involving text, image, audio, and interleaved content. Extensive human validation demonstrates that MMMG correlates better with human judgments compared to previous benchmarks. Benchmarking results highlight ongoing challenges in multimodal reasoning, interleaved generation, and audio generation. The fine-grained nature of MMMG enables detailed capability analysis, providing valuable insights for targeted multimodal improvements. Beyond serving as leaderboard, we hope MMMG inspires scalable collection of verifiable validation signals for future multimodal generation training. Given the page limit, we refer readers to Appendix for limitations and social impacts discussion."

            "title": "A Limitations and Social Impacts",
            "content": "While MMMG constitutes significant advancement in automated multimodal generation evaluation, we acknowledge several limitations inherent to our methodology and scope. Limited Task Coverage. MMMG does not exhaustively cover all potential tasks within multimodal generation, particularly in the domains of interleaved image-text generation and sound/music generation. This limitation primarily arises from current inadequacies in available evaluation methods or models, which fail to yield sufficiently human-aligned results on numerous widely-used tasks. Such gaps in coverage may introduce biases into our model rankings, potentially misaligning evaluation results with actual user experiences. To mitigate this, we intend to dynamically expand and update our benchmark tasks in real-time as more powerful and reliable evaluation models become available. We also include tasks that we considered commonly used but abandoned due to infeasible evaluation in Appendix B.2. Dependence on Proprietary Models. Our evaluation heavily relies on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4O, GEMINI 2.5). The substantial performance gap between proprietary and open-source models makes reliance on proprietary models necessary for achieving highly accurate and human-aligned evaluations across diverse tasks. Unfortunately, current open-source alternatives often lack sufficient accuracy on certain complex tasks, rendering them unsuitable as reliable evaluators. Consequently, this dependence limits broad reproducibility and access within the academic community, highlighting the urgent need for improved and accessible open-source evaluation models."

            "title": "B Detailed Dataset Information",
            "content": "B.1 Data Source Object Reasoning. We sample from HotpotQA [Yang et al., 2018] through the official website. We take the QA pairs where the answers are individual objects and can be directly transformed into image generation instructions or the answers are nations and can be transformed into the national flags or animals generation instructions. Image Editing. We sample images from EmuEdit [Sheynin et al., 2024] through the facebook/emu_edit_test_set checkpoint on Huggingface [Wolf et al., 2019] for object adding, removing, modifying and text editing tasks. We modify the instructions to make sure they are clear and unambiguous. We also sample object images from COCO [Lin et al., 2014] through the official website and use PhotoShop to combine with the scene images in EmuEdit to form golden reference images. We sample scene images from CLEVR [Johnson et al., 2017] through the official website for the interleaved color modifying task, since modifying color for pure-colored geometries is much more unambiguous than regular objects. We also use PhotoShop to generate the golden reference images. 3D transformation. We sample instructions and golden reference images from ISG-Bench [Chen et al., 2025a] through the official website. We polish the instructions to make sure they are clear and unambiguous. Math. We sample images from MM-IQ [Cai et al., 2025] through the huanqia/MM-IQ checkpoint on Huggingface. We manually edit the images to transform the multiple-choice questions into free-form generation questions. We have 2 annotators to check if the free-form questions can only have one possible answer without alternatives. Code. We sample SVG codes from StarVector [Rodriguez et al., 2023] through the starvector/text2svg-stack checkpoint on Huggingface. and transform the original image-totext instructions into interleaved reasoning instructions. We samples SVG codes with length between 1000-1500 characters to control difficulty. Sound Generation. We make sure all the target sounds fall in the 50 categories in ESC-50 [Piczak, 2015] through the ashraq/esc50 checkpoint on Huggingface so that CLAPScoreaudio can have reference audios to compare with. Instrument Generation. We make sure all the target instruments fall in the 20 categories in OpenMIC-2018 [Humphrey et al., 2018] through the official website so that CLAPScoreaudio can have reference audios to compare with. 16 Speech Replication. We samples speaker voices from LibriSpeech [Panayotov et al., 2015] ASR corpus through the official website and use them as reference speeches for voice replication tasks. The remaining tasks are generated from GPT-4O with manually designed templates. B.2 Excluded Tasks We present the remaining 27 tasks we considered from our initial task set in Table 4. We exclude Format Color, Format Symmetric, Speech Transcribing, Speech Encoding tasks since they are not commonly seen in real user queries and Image-to-Sound and Sound-toImage tasks are excluded because no models today can support these modalities.

To encourage diversity, we only incorporate the latest model of series. Even though our benchmark supports comprehensive and cross-modality evaluation, current multimodal generation models have very restricted output modalities.

For agent-based models, we prepend system prompt to the instructions. This system prompt explicitly instructs the model to generate outputs following structured, function-call-based approach. When the model needs visual or auditory outputs, it generates placeholders formatted as function calls within the text. Each placeholder clearly specifies the generation instructions and any necessary references to prior outputs or provided multimedia in users instructions. For each placeholder, we extract the function call, which are then fed into specialized image or audio generation models. To correctly handle references to previously generated media, we employ topological sorting. This ensures media outputs are generated in sequence by dependencies, and circular dependencies are identified and reported as errors. Detailed system prompt for interleaved image-text agent is in Table 6 and interleaved audio-text agent is in Table 7. C.3 Evaluation Details Prompts for VLMs Object Count. How many [object] are there in the given image? Choose from the options: A. Less than 3 or the image is blank B. 3 C. 4 D. 5 E. 6 F. More than 6. Respond only with the option letter (A, B, C, D, or F). Do not provide any explanation, reasoning, or additional information. Multiple choice questions can boost VLMs performance on object count tasks. We employ this prompt for object count and self count tasks. Absolute Spacial Relationship. The [object] is located in which section of the image? Choose from the options: A. bottom left B. bottom right C. up left D. up right E. none of the above (positioned in more central way) Explain step by step and end your answer with Answer: [only an optional letter]. Multiple choice questions can boost VLMs performance on spacial reasoning tasks. We employ this prompt for absolute spatial relationship and self absolute spatial relationship recognizing tasks. Left-Right Spacial Relationship. Looking at the 2D composition of the image, what is the horizontal alignment relationship between the [object1] and the [object2]? Choose from the options: A. the [object1] is obviously to the left of the [object2]. B. the [object1] is obviously to the right of the [object2]. C. the [object1] is neither obviously to the right nor left of the [object2]. Explain step by step and end your answer with Answer: [only an optional letter]. VLMs tend to be confused by perspective relationship, thus we ask VLMs to focus on 2D composition. We employ this prompt for relative spatial relationship and self relative spatial relationship recognizing tasks. Up-Down Spacial Relationship. Looking at the 2D composition of the image, what is the vertical alignment relationship between the [object1] and the [object2]? Choose from the options: A. the [object1] is obviously positioned higher than the [object2]. B. the [object1] is obviously positioned lower than the [object2]. C. the [object1] is neither obviously positioned higher nor lower than the [object2]. Explain step by step and end your answer with Answer: [only an optional letter]. We employ this prompt for relative spatial relationship and self relative spatial relationship recognizing tasks. OCR English. ### Instruction: Recognize all the major texts (ignore small texts on the edge) ONLY on [object]. Only recognize texts in Latin alphabet characters (a-z, A-Z). Do not correct the text if it is misspelled, nonsense or wrong, output the most direct recognition result. Do not call any function. ### Output format: Output an executable Python list of all recognized texts from top to down, from left to right, e.g. [Hello World, Good morning]. Output an empty list if the there is no text on [object] or the image is blank. We employ this prompt for single and double text rendering and self OCR tasks. OCR Chinese. ### Instruction: You are conservative text recognition model. Your task is to recognize all the major Chinese characters in the given image. If the Chinese characters in the image are wrongly written or distorted, you should return an empty string. Do not call any function. ### Output format: Only string of all recognized characters from top to down, from left to right. Do not add quotations. We employ this prompt for multi-lingual text rendering task. Since VLMs tend to recognize Chinese characters incorrectly or identify fake characters, 19 You are multimodal assistant capable of generating both text and images. When visual content would enhance your response or is specifically requested, you can generate or edit images through advanced diffusion models. To generate or edit an image: 1. Identify when visual content would be beneficial or requested. 2. Insert an image generation/editing placeholder using the following format: <image_start><image_prompt=\"Detailed image generation or editing prompt here.\"><image_ref=[reference identifiers]><image_end> 3. The post-processing system replaces this placeholder with an image created or edited based on your instructions. 4. Naturally incorporate references to the generated or edited image in your ongoing conversation. When crafting image prompts, follow these guidelines: For image prompts: Provide detailed, specific descriptions (15-30 words) for optimal results. Include artistic styles (photorealistic, cartoon, watercolor, etc.) or style transfers. Specify key objects and their attributes (colors, textures, etc.), or modifications. Detail composition elements (spatial relationships, perspective, lighting, etc.), or compositional changes. Ensure instructions are clear and concise. For image references: Three reference types are available: 1. Image generation (no reference): <image_ref=[]> 2. Editing user-provided images: Format: <image_ref=[i]> where is the index of the provided image (indices starting at 0). Example: <image_ref=[0]> references the first provided image. Multiple images example: <image_ref=[0,2]> references the first and third provided images. 3. Editing previously generated images: Format: <image_ref=[#N]>, where is the sequential number of previously generated images (starting from 0). Example: <image_ref=[#3]> references the fourth generated image. Multiple images example: <image_ref=[#0,#2]> references the first and third generated images. Important: Use only one reference type within each placeholder. Different reference types may be used across multiple placeholders. Provide concise and direct responses following user instructions precisely. Always maintain the exact placeholder format for proper parsing, ensuring that both images and text appear in the required order. Do not omit any necessary text following image placeholders. Table 6: System prompt for interleaved image-text agent. we employ two separate VLMs and use the intersection of their recognition results to improve accuracy. Text Pattern Verifying (Math) Below are two descriptions of the same geometric pattern, one is ground-truth and the other is model-generated. Your task is to judge if the generated description is 20 You are multimodal assistant capable of generating both text and audio. When audio content would enhance your response or is specifically requested, you can generate audio through text-to-audio models. To generate audio: 1. Identify when audio content would be beneficial or requested. 2. Insert an audio generation placeholder using the format: <audio_start><audio_type=\"sound\" OR \"speech\" OR \"music\"><audio_text=\"Text to be spoken here.\"><audio_style=\"Descriptive text here.\" OR audio reference ID><audio_end> 3. The post-processing system replaces this placeholder with generated audio based on your specifications. 4. Naturally incorporate references to the generated audio in your ongoing conversation. When crafting audio prompts, follow these guidelines: Audio Type: Must be exactly one of: \"sound\", \"speech\", or \"music\". \"speech\": For human speech. \"sound\": For environmental sounds or effects. \"music\": For musical compositions or instrumental pieces. Audio Text: For \"speech\": Provide the exact transcript. For \"sound\" or \"music\": Leave as empty string (\"\"). Keep speech concise (typically under 50 words). Audio Style: 1. Descriptive Text: For \"speech\": Specify voice characteristics (gender, emotion, pace, pitch, accent). For \"sound\": Specify sound source, environment, qualities. For \"music\": Specify genre, mood, tempo, instruments. 2. Reference Audio: For consistency, particularly with speech: Previously generated audio: <audio_style=#N> (N is sequential number starting at 0). User-provided audio: <audio_style=N> (N is sequential number of provided audio starting at 0). Important: Only reference audio that itself does not reference previous audio to avoid circular references. Provide concise, direct responses precisely following user instructions. In multi-speaker scenarios, maintain consistent and distinctive voice characteristics for each speaker. Always maintain the exact placeholder format for correct parsing Table 7: System prompt for interleaved audio-text agent. accurate. Analyze step by step and end your answer with Yes or No. Here are some criteria: 1. The model-generated pattern must state the pattern clearly without ambiguity. For example, 3*3 grid of circles with some circles filled is ambiguous. 2. Make sure the overall structure, the position and situation of each element are accurate. Specifically, the situation of each element can include: filled (black, grey, filled with black or any equivalent words), unfilled (white, hollow, empty or any equivalent words), missing (the position is empty or missing). If the situation is not specified 21 in the ground-truth, the element can take any situation of the right shape. 3. If the ground-truth describes coordinate system, the x-axis will increase from left to right while y-axis will increase from top to down. For example, for 3*3 grid, the (3,2) coordinate is the middle-right element. We employ this prompt for math task. Image Verifying (Math) Your task is to judge if the given image accurately follows the groundtruth pattern. Analyze step by step and end your answer with Yes or No. Here are some criteria: 1. Make sure the overall structure, the position and situation of each element are accurate. Specifically, the situation of each element can include: filled (black, grey, filled with black or any equivalents), unfilled (white, hollow, empty or any equivalents), missing (the position is empty, missing or any equivalents). If the situation is not specified in the ground-truth, the element can take any situation of the right shape. 2. If the ground-truth describes coordinate system, the x-axis will increase from left to right while y-axis will increase from top to down. For example, for 3*3 grid, the (3,2) coordinate is the middle-right element. 3. If the given image contains multiple patterns (e.g. multiple grids) or question mark, the given image doesnt follow the ground-truth pattern. We employ this prompt for math task. Object Existing. Is/Are there [detailed object description] in the given image? Explain step by step and end your answer with Yes or No. Answer No if the image is blank. We design detailed object description for each instruction manually, include object number, object attributes and undesired negative attributes, etc.. We employ this prompts for all image tasks unmentioned above. For spatial relation tasks, we first exam if the object number is accurate by object existing prompt and then check spatial relationship by corresponding prompts. Program Verifying Solid Color Fill. The evaluation procedure starts by cropping the targeted region from the image and calculating its average RGB value. The average RGB value is compared with standard reference color; if the relative deviation exceeds 15%, indicating significant color discrepancy, the evaluation returns zero. Next, structural consistency is assessed by computing the SSIM between the targeted region and an artificially generated solid region filled with the calculated average RGB color, confirming color uniformity. Finally, the procedure examines over-fill by evaluating the margin area surrounding the targeted region and computing the proportion of pixels matching the regions average RGB color. The ratio as penalty is subtracted from the SSIM score. Image Editing. The evaluation for image editing begins by manually labeling potential editing area within each image. Then crop the edited area from the generated image and compare against the corresponding area in reference image or assessed via VLM. Additionally, regions outside this area are compared with corresponding original outside area using SSIM to detect unintended changes. The final score is the product of these two comparisons, reflecting editing accuracy and preservation of original content. Sound Generation. For begin-end tasks, clip the first or last 4 seconds of audio directly. For positional inclusion tasks, crop the corresponding fraction of the audio. For silence detection tasks, utilize the librosa.effects.split function to segment audio based on silence intervals and then verify if each section contains target sound through CLAPScoreudio. Music Generation. For tempo evaluation, use BEATTHIS to extract beat tracks and calculate Beats Per Minute (BPM). For intensity evaluation, analyze the initial and final 4 seconds of the music, plotting the energy spectrum through librosa.feature.rms and computing its slope and goodness of fit. Only audio segments demonstrating clear upward or downward trends in energy pass the intensity evaluation. Speech Generation. For pitch evaluation, calculate the average energy of each pitch through parselmouth.Sound.to_pitch and select the pitch with the highest average energy through parselmouth.Sound.to_intensity as the speech pitch. For speed evaluation, transcribe English audio using WHISPER and compute words per minute (WPM); for Chinese audio, compute characters per minute (CPM). For textual constraints, normalize transcripts using WHISPERs tokenizer (removing punctuation, case sensitivity, etc.) and evaluate with the tools of IFEval. C.4 Annotation Interface We design task-specific annotation interfaces by Gradio [Abid et al., 2019], each including reference images or audio, models generated outputs, judgment instructions, and judgment criteria. We 22 Figure 4: Human annotation interface for instrument inclusion task. Typically, an inference will include reference audios/images, models generation, evaluation instruction, evaluation criteria and judgment radio boxes and next/previous button. preprocess some generated outputs to assist annotators in their judgments. For example, we provide cropped images within editing area for image editing tasks and clipped audio segments at the beginning or end for audio begin-end tasks. Judgments are typically collected through multiplechoice radio buttons to ensure high inter-annotator agreement. However, for OCR tasks specifically, annotators type the recognized text directly. An example of annotation interface is in Figure 4. C.5 Annotation Questions What is the dominant instrument played the given audio? Reminder: 1. Instrument Inclusion. Failed generation should be considered as none of the above. 2. Choose multiple labels only when you are unsure or the given audio clearly have different types of instruments. We employ this question for instrument inclusion and exclusion tasks. Is the given audio about [sound]? Reminder: 1. Chose yes when [sound] is the Sound Inclusion. main sound existing in the audio. 2. [sound] should be common real-world sound without distortion. We employ this question for all sound generation tasks. Are the speeches coming from the same speaker? Reminder: 1. Little speaker Speaker Similarity. voice difference can be tolerated, but overall, there should be no major difference. We employ this question for voice replication and conversation tasks. What is the gender of the speaker in the given speech? Reminder: 1. Choose Speaker Gender none of above when the voice sounds like electronic synthesizer sound or it is hard to categorize into binary genders. 2. Do not consider speech quality (clarity and fluency, etc.) when judging gender. We employ this question for voice attribution and multi-lingual speech tasks. Experiment Results (Cont.) D.1 Correlation with Human Annotation We report the agreement and Pearson correlation of MMMG with human annotation per task in Table 8. We exclude DreamSim and Whisper as they are widely recognized as established silver standards [Huang et al., 2025, Mehrish et al., 2023]. D.2 Full Benchmarking Results Evaluation results of 24 multimodal generation models on 49 tasks are listed in Table 9, Table 10, Table 11 and Table 12, categorized by modalities. We report the following additional findings: Although image generation models generally maintain consistent rankings across various tasks, certain models exhibit notable weaknesses in specific areas. For instance, IDEOGRAM 2 performs particularly poorly when tasked with including unrelated objects in scene, whereas IMAGEN 3 struggles significantly with text rendering. These observations underscore the effectiveness of MMMG in pinpointing specific model weakness. When comparing different interleaved image-text agent models, GEMINI 2.5 demonstrates superior planning capabilities over GPT-4O, resulting in 38.2% performance improvement with the image generator GPT IMAGE. Additionally, although GPT IMAGE generally outperforms IMAGEN 3, this advantage partly arises from IMAGEN 3s inability to accurately perform image editing tasks. Unified understanding-generation models such as JANUS [Chen et al., 2025c] are excluded from our evaluation due to their requirement for manual modality selection, limiting their capability for automated, interleaved generation tasks. We also notice that models like ANOLE and SEEDLLAMA trained only on individual image generation and image understanding tasks cant follow instructions at all for interleaved image-text input. This highlight the importance of collecting more comprehensive image-text interleaved dataset for training. The natural speech-text interleaved model SPIRIT LM rarely scores above zero on evaluated tasks, suggesting it lacks adequate instruction tuning and consequently struggles to follow instructions effectively. In comparison, VOXINSTRUCT significantly outperforms VOICELDM, achieving an 82.1% improvement, and thus demonstrates superior functionality as multi-purpose speech synthesizer. Models like GPT-4O-AUDIO and QWEN2.5-OMNI [Xu et al., 2025] doesnt support customized speaker voice, thus can not be evaluated. Models like YUE, which are designed for text-to-song generation, may face challenges when are required to generate pure music. D.3 Analysis Interleaved System Prompt. To investigate whether autoregressive models capabilities in generating the desired number and order of modalities can be improved, we conducted experiments with GEMINI IMAGE using the planning system prompt detailed in Table 13. The experimental results, summarized in Table 14, indicate that incorporating system prompts emphasizing modality count and order does not consistently lead to positive outcomes. Generally, adding system prompt negatively impacts image generation quality, as the models shift their focus away from optimizing visual quality. 24 Task Object Inclusion Object Exclusion Object Count Object Reasoning Object Attribution Compassion Relation Universal Relation Relative Spatial Absolute Spatial Text Rendering (TR) Double TR Multi-lingual TR Semantic Composition Decomposition Text Editing Object Adding Object Removing Object Modifying Self Count Self Color Self Size Self OCR Self Relative Spatial Self Absolute Spatial Math Code Average Task Sound Begin-End Sound Inclusion Sound Reasoning Sound Silence Instrument Inclusion Instrument Exclusion Average Task Voice Attribution Voice Replication Speech Multi-lingual Conversation Average GPT-4O GEMINI 2.5 QWEN2.5-VL IAA agree 0.975 1.000 0.975 1.000 0.950 0.925 0.975 0.925 0.825 0.991 0.841 0.889 0.958 0.971 0.971 0.928 0.975 0.975 0.925 0.975 0.950 0.892 0.906 0.838 0.913 0.950 1. 0.941 corr 0.912 1.000 0.943 1.000 0.882 0.850 0.951 0.819 0.825 0.991 0.906 0.989 0.910 0.930 0.941 1.000 0.912 0.933 0.819 0.950 0.881 0.788 0.909 0.669 0.821 0.436 1.000 0.881 agree 0.950 0.950 0.925 1.000 0.900 0.875 0.900 0.825 0.925 0.992 0.646 0.889 0.946 0.942 0.971 0.908 0.925 0.975 0.975 0.950 0.950 0.867 0.806 0.950 0.950 1.000 1. 0.922 corr 0.804 0.905 0.827 1.000 0.722 0.741 0.818 0.640 0.839 1.000 0.662 0.968 0.890 0.847 0.941 1.000 0.728 0.933 0.941 0.899 0.883 0.735 0.790 0.896 0.897 1.000 1.000 0.863 agree 0.750 0.900 0.550 0.950 0.700 0.625 0.750 0.825 0.550 0.945 0.566 0.773 0.855 0.855 0.877 0.840 0.875 0.975 0.900 0.575 0.808 0.558 0.917 0.788 0.725 0.688 1. 0.782 corr 0.514 0.799 0.051 0.905 0.144 0.349 0.504 0.605 0.252 0.787 0.595 0.965 0.684 0.647 0.751 0.794 0.498 0.928 0.749 0.130 0.592 0.233 0.942 0.552 0.526 -0.074 1.000 0.571 CLAPScoreaudio corr agree CLAPScoretext corr agree 0.925 0.850 0.944 0.975 0.967 0.893 0.926 agree - 0.875 - 0.850 0.863 WavLM 0.951 0.711 0.817 0.946 0.894 0.663 0.831 corr - 0.731 - 0.630 0.681 0.825 0.800 0.861 0.975 0.900 0. 0.763 0.687 0.564 0.534 0.946 0.598 0.053 0.563 Wav2Vec agree 0.949 - 0.966 - 0.957 corr 0.826 - 0.876 - 0.851 GEMINI 2.5 agree 0.625 0.650 0.639 0.950 0.867 0.821 0.759 agree 0.950 0.925 0.925 0.925 0.931 corr 0.204 0.207 0.439 0.690 0.447 0.438 0.404 corr 0.844 0.843 0.856 0.819 0.841 IAA agree 1.000 1.000 0.975 1.000 1.000 0.950 0.975 0.950 0.983 1.000 0.938 1.000 0.982 0.978 0.978 0.950 1.000 1.000 0.925 1.000 0.983 0.967 1.000 0.963 0.975 0.988 1.000 0.980 agree 0.967 0.925 0.917 1.000 1.000 0.929 0. corr 1.000 1.000 0.943 1.000 1.000 0.896 0.951 0.875 0.960 1.000 0.938 1.000 0.961 0.944 0.956 0.950 1.000 1.000 0.819 1.000 0.960 0.933 1.000 0.923 0.948 0.703 1.000 0.950 corr 0.933 0.856 0.720 1.000 1.000 0.782 0.

MMMG achieves an average best human agreement of 0.943 with average interannotator agreement being 0.971. GPT-4O is the most human-aligned image evaluation model while CLAPScoreaudio is the most human-aligned audio evaluation method. Conversely, image editing tasks benefit from the addition of system prompts since without such prompts, models frequently generate multiple images unnecessarily. Nonetheless, system prompts do not effectively support generating sequential images or integrated image-text pairs, because models continue to intermix multiple images during generation, as illustrated in Figure 3. Variance Control. We present the 95% confidence intervals along with the average scores for each task in Table 9, Table 10, Table 11 and Table 12. sample size of 4 can substantially reduce variance, with the maximum relative confidence interval being 16.3% and the average relative confidence interval being 5.2%. 25 Task IMAGEN 3 RECRAFT V3 LUMA PHOTON FLUX 1.1 PRO IDEO -GRAM 2 DALLE 3 SD 3.
