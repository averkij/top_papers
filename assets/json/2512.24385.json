            "content": "With the rapid proliferation of autonomous platforms, ranging from self-driving vehicles [72, 122, 166] and aerial drones [162, 302] to unmanned surface vehicles [52, 271], rail-based systems [114, 282, 325], and legged robots [55, 57], the challenge of endowing machines with the capability to perceive and act in the real world has reached an unprecedented level of complexity. As these systems are required to navigate diverse and dynamically evolving scenarios, they demand robust and deeply nuanced understanding of their environment to support critical downstream functions, including navigation [4, 156], interaction [81], and planning [72, 143]. Central to these platforms is sophisticated suite of onboard sensors, primarily comprising cameras, LiDAR, radar, and emerging event cameras, which collectively serve as the foundation for perception [17, 21, 47, 69]. Each modality contributes unique and complementary stream of information, where cameras provide rich visual semantics [122, 244], LiDAR delivers precise 3D geometry [108, 125], and radar captures essential motion cues [179, 272], while event cameras offer microsecond-level temporal precision for high-speed dynamics [56, 100, 152, 266]. The effective integration of these heterogeneous data streams is paramount for achieving the 1 Figure 1 Overview of the paper structure. We systematically structure the landscape of multi-modal data pre-training for forging Spatial Intelligence. This work is organized into four key pillars: (1) Background, introducing onboard sensors and foundational learning paradigms; (2) Platforms & Datasets, analyzing benchmarks across autonomous vehicles, drones, and other robotic systems; (3) Pre-Training Methodologies, categorized into single-modality, cross-modal (Camera/LiDAR-centric), and unified frameworks; and (4) Applications, highlighting downstream tasks from 3D perception to open-world planning. holistic perception required for safe and generalizable autonomy [61, 104, 116, 189, 245]. In response to this demand, the research community has curated numerous large-scale and sensor-centric datasets [22, 47, 199], alongside specialized benchmarks for drones [162, 302] and robotic agents [57]. While these datasets provide an invaluable empirical foundation, they simultaneously highlight fundamental challenge that constitutes the central focus of this work. Most existing datasets heavily rely on costly manual annotations to support supervised learning paradigms [17, 47, 52], creating significant bottlenecks for scalability and generalization [102, 103, 205, 221, 246]. Consequently, there has been growing interest in representation learning methods that aim to distill meaningful features directly from raw sensor data, alleviating the dependence on extensive human supervision [6264, 240]. Particularly noteworthy is the emergence of foundation models, which facilitate large-scale, transferable pre-training across various domains, including vision [96, 182], 3D geometry [140, 298], and multi-modal scenarios [107, 264, 323]. Such foundation models provide unified paradigm for extracting general-purpose representations from diverse sensor inputs [105, 158, 270], significantly enhancing cross-domain adaptability and paving the way for next-generation world models [71, 106, 125, 126, 146, 166, 255, 305]. As result, pre-training strategies tailored specifically to sensor modalities have become an essential research frontier. As depicted in Fig. 1, these strategies form the core techniques to forge what we define as Spatial Intelligence capability that transcends simple detection to encompass holistic scene understanding, reasoning, and future prediction [127, 143, 270]. Current approaches include single-modality methods (e.g., LiDAR-only or camera-only) [3, 65, 108, 288], cross-modal knowledge transfer (e.g., distillation between camera and LiDAR) [101, 189, 270], and unified multi-modal pre-training frameworks [264, 323]. Understanding the overall landscape of these methods, as well as their connections to sensor characteristics, platform constraints, and the development of foundation models, is crucial for advancing robust and efficient perception capabilities 2 in intelligent systems. In this work, we systematically analyze the state-of-the-art techniques in representation learning from onboard sensor data, emphasizing multi-modal interactions and integration with foundation models. We first dissect foundational methodologies such as self-supervised learning, transfer learning, and multimodal learning, evaluating their respective strengths and limitations across various autonomous platforms, including self-driving vehicles, drones, robotic dogs, and rail transportation systems. By structuring and characterizing representative pre-training approaches according to modality composition, sensor interactions, and targeted applications, we highlight their adaptability to diverse sensor configurations and practical scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate key challenges in sensor representation learning, such as data sparsity, sensor noise, multi-modal alignment, and real-time processing demands. Finally, we propose promising directions for future research toward generative world models and embodied reasoning suitable for dynamic real-world environments."

            "content": "Multi-modal representation learning from onboard sensors encompasses various related areas, such as singlemodality pre-training, cross-modal fusion, and foundation model integration. Given the breadth of these topics, it is impractical to exhaustively analyze all relevant methods within single manuscript. Therefore, this work specifically concentrates on recent advances in foundation models for multi-modal representation learning, primarily focusing on onboard camera and LiDAR sensors [192, 264, 270]. Representative methods involving additional sensors such as radar and event cameras are also examined [37, 266, 267, 272]. We emphasize significant progress from the past five years, particularly highlighting influential works published in top-tier conferences and journals. In addition to technical approaches, we analyze widely adopted datasets, evaluation metrics, and sensor configurations. Finally, we investigate key challenges and outline promising future research directions."

While these efforts offer valuable insights into targeted aspects of the field, they often discuss sensors and tasks independently, lacking an integrated perspective on how single-modality and cross-modal approaches collectively advance multi-modal representation learning. In contrast, our work presents comprehensive framework emphasizing the role of foundation models within multi-modal representation learning from onboard sensors. We systematically analyze modality-specific pretraining as well as cross-modal interactions and unified frameworks, clearly highlighting how these methods interconnect and contribute to robust, generalizable perception across various platforms and tasks. By bridging single-modality strategies with unified multi-modal paradigms, this study uniquely facilitates an in-depth understanding of recent advances, emerging trends, and future directions in multi-modal pre-training for autonomous systems."

It aims to transcend simple feature extraction by distilling compact, discriminative, and semantically rich representations from diverse sensory inputs. By effectively integrating complementary information from modalities such as cameras, LiDAR and radar, these methods enable foundation models to not only perceive geometry and semantics but also reason about dynamics and affordances [127, 270]. In the context of autonomous deployment, developing scalable and reliable multi-modal pre-training approaches is essential for achieving robust open-world generalization and bridging the gap between passive perception and active embodied reasoning."

            "content": "The sensory apparatus of intelligent agents, primarily comprising cameras, LiDAR, radar, and event cameras, presents heterogeneous data landscape characterized by distinct modalities and formats. Cameras provide dense semantic and textural information essential for scene understanding [122, 270], yet they remain susceptible to environmental variations such as illumination changes and adverse weather conditions. In contrast, LiDAR sensors deliver precise 3D geometric structures via point clouds [108, 157, 243], which offer robustness against lighting variations but suffer from inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness. Radar provides robust Doppler velocity cues even in adverse weather, albeit at lower spatial resolution [37, 272]. Complementing these with microsecond-level temporal precision, event cameras capture asynchronous brightness changes to handle high-speed dynamics and motion blur inherent in standard vision [98100, 266, 308]. Understanding the inherent properties of these sensors, specifically the trade-off between the semantic richness of vision and the geometric precision of ranging sensors, is fundamental. Effective representation learning must address these disparities to construct unified and coherent world model."

            "title": "2.2 Paradigms of Representation Learning",
            "content": "To forge spatial intelligence from the heterogeneous data streams described above, robust methodological framework is required. The evolution of this framework has followed clear logical progression, as chronologically illustrated in Fig. 2. Initially, to overcome the immense cost of manual annotation, the field turned to Self-Supervised Learning to extract meaningful features directly from vast quantities of unlabeled data. natural next step was to exploit the complementary nature of different sensors through Cross-Modality Interaction, creating more holistic representation than any single sensor could provide. Concurrently, Knowledge Distillation and Transfer Learning emerged as powerful technique to leverage priors from well-established vision foundation models, accelerating progress in 3D domains. Ultimately, these distinct paradigms are being synthesized under unified vision: the development of Foundation Models and Generative World Models. 2.2.1 Self-Supervised Learning Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for representation learning from unlabeled sensor data [20, 62, 63, 171]. By defining suitable pretext tasks, models leverage supervisory signals inherently present within the data. Classic strategies include Contrastive Learning, which discriminates between augmented views of the same instance, and Masked Modeling, which reconstructs obscured portions of inputs [63, 97, 108]. More recently, Generative Modeling (e.g., next-token prediction or video generation) has gained prominence [8, 305]. By learning to predict future frames or occupancy states, these methods enable models to internalize the physics and dynamics of the environment, serving as precursor to world models. 4 Figure 2 Chronological evolution of representative pre-training methods (20202025). The timeline illustrates the paradigm shift in representation learning for autonomous systems. Early approaches predominantly focused on single-modality self-supervision (e.g., LiDAR-only contrastive learning). In contrast, recent advancements (2023present) demonstrate surge in cross-modal synergy, characterized by Camera/LiDAR-centric methods and Unified pre-training frameworks, ultimately paving the way for generative world models and comprehensive spatial intelligence. 2.2.2 Cross-Modality Interaction Cross-modal interaction methods aim to fuse disparate sensor modalities into unified representation space, enhancing both robustness and semantic depth [166, 192, 256, 270]. For instance, projecting dense visual features from cameras onto sparse LiDAR point clouds allows models to achieve superior spatial-semantic reasoning [6, 250, 275]. Key challenges addressed by these approaches include spatio-temporal alignment, handling modality-specific noise, and maintaining robustness when one modality is degraded or missing. 2.2.3 Knowledge Distillation and Transfer Learning While transfer learning traditionally involves adapting pre-trained weights to new domains [145, 277], in the context of multi-modal autonomous systems, it increasingly takes the form of Knowledge Distillation. Here, powerful 2D vision foundation models (teachers) are used to guide the training of 3D sensor backbones (students). This allows 3D models to inherit the open-vocabulary capabilities and rich semantics of large-scale vision models [96, 171, 182] without requiring massive annotated 3D datasets [158, 189]. This paradigm effectively bridges the data scale gap between the 2D image domain and the 3D robotics domain. 2.2.4 Foundation Models Foundation models represent paradigm shift from specialized pipelines to unified, scalable representation learning [13, 196]. In the vision domain, the trajectory from CNNs [60] to Transformers [38] and generalpurpose encoders like DINO [20, 171] and SAM [96, 184] has established robust, transferable perceptual priors. Recent research integrates these visual priors into non-visual modalities (e.g., LiDAR and radar) via cross-modal alignment, enriching 3D perception with open-world semantics [101, 256, 272]. Crucially, the field is now advancing beyond perception towards Generative World Models [106, 305] and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models [39, 143, 217]. These next-generation foundation models integrate vision, language, and action into unified reasoning framework [71, 118], enabling systems not just to recognize objects, but to simulate future scenarios and plan actions in complex, dynamic environments.

            "content": "3.2.1 Autonomous Vehicles Autonomous driving serves as the primary testbed for multi-modal spatial intelligence. Vehicles typically deploy redundant sensor suite consisting of surround-view cameras, high-beam LiDARs, and radars to ensure safetycritical perception [104, 222, 244]. The continuous collection of synchronized sensor streams has produced massive-scale datasets [7, 17, 47, 170, 199], which act as the fuel for self-supervised pre-training. Current methodologies leverage these unlabeled streams for pretext tasks such as temporal future prediction [166, 270], cross-modal masked reconstruction [1, 135, 264], and contrastive distillation [189, 256], effectively turning raw data into transferable representations without human labeling. Table 1 summarizes representative datasets. Notably, the evolution from early perception-centric benchmarks (e.g., KITTI [47]) to modern reasoning-centric datasets (e.g., nuPlan [18] and Argoverse 2 [235]) highlights crucial trend: the integration of high-definition maps, long-horizon trajectories, and increasingly, languagebased scenario descriptions [143, 219]. These rich annotations are pivotal for training next-generation End-to-End planners and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models [71, 118, 119]. 3.2.2 Drones (UAVs) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) present unique perception challenges due to their birds-eye viewpoints, six degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion, and rapid scale changes [69, 155, 220]. While RGB cameras and IMUs remain standard, advanced datasets now incorporate LiDAR to capture 3D structural information for complex environments [69, 273]. Table 2 details key UAV datasets. Unlike ground vehicles, UAV data is characterized by significant perspective distortion and motion blur [155, 302]. Consequently, pre-training in this domain heavily utilizes transfer learning from ground-level or satellite imagery [317], adapting visual foundation models to aerial domains. Recent efforts also explore cross-view geo-localization and self-supervised flow estimation to handle the dynamic nature of flight. The emergence of multi-modal UAV datasets [220, 273, 302] is crucial for extending Spatial Intelligence from 2D ground planes to 3D volumetric spaces. 8 Table 3 Overview of multi-modal datasets for diverse robotic platforms.

These domains challenge pre-training models with unique noise patterns (e.g., water reflections for USVs) and motion dynamics (e.g., non-linear locomotion for quadrupeds). Table 3 lists representative datasets. For instance, datasets for legged robots [57, 154] emphasize egocentric perception under severe camera shake, motivating research into robust, motion-aware representation learning. Similarly, rail and USV datasets focus on long-range, track-constrained perception [181, 271, 325]. growing trend in these specialized domains is the use of Simulation-to-Real transfer and domain adaption [21, 124]. Engines like QuaDreamer [237] generate synthetic training data to supplement scarce real-world samples, training models that can generalize to physical robots via domain randomization. This highlights the increasing role of synthetic data in democratizing foundation models for varied robotic form factors [209]."

            "content": "Analyzing the landscape of platform-specific datasets identifies three evolutionary trends that are reshaping multi-modal pre-training: From Perception to Reasoning and Action. Modern datasets are moving beyond bounding boxes. Benchmarks like nuPlan [18] and OmniDrive [219] introduce planning trajectories, logic-based scenarios, and open-vocabulary language labels. This shift enables the training of models that do not just see but reason and act, laying the groundwork for Embodied AI and VLA models [71, 118, 143, 177]. The Rise of Synthetic and Generative Data. Recognizing the long-tail limitations of real-world data, there is surge in high-fidelity synthetic datasets and simulation environments [162, 209, 237]. This supports the development of Generative World Models, which can simulate infinite what-if scenarios for robust policy learning, effectively closing the loop between perception and simulation [106, 126]. Scale and Diversity for Foundation Models. The explosion in data volume and modality diversity (from LiDAR to Event cameras) has rendered manual annotation obsolete [21, 108, 266]. This reality firmly establishes Self-Supervised Pre-Training as the necessary paradigm. Future progress will depend on data engines that can automatically curate, label, and align these massive multi-modal streams to feed hungry foundation models [101, 264]. These trends collectively signal transition: datasets are no longer just static benchmarks for performance Table 4 Comprehensive summary of LiDAR-based pre-training techniques.

As depicted in the taxonomy  (Fig. 3)  , we structure the landscape based on sensor interaction paradigms: Single-Modality baselines, Multi-Modality synergy (including Camera-Centric and LiDAR-Centric distillation), and Unified frameworks that jointly optimize cross-modal encoders. Beyond the modality-based categorization, we emphasize crucial trend: the integration of Foundation Models and Generative Objectives. Recent approaches are shifting from simple discriminative tasks to generative reconstruction [92, 264](e.g., NeRF, 3DGS) and future forecasting [127, 166, 270], leveraging the rich semantic priors of large-scale vision models to enhance geometric reasoning [189, 279]. We also briefly discuss complementary sensors such as radar and event cameras [179, 266, 267, 272]. Finally, we synthesize benchmark performance to offer holistic evaluation of how these pre-training techniques translate to downstream perception tasks."

            "title": "4.1 Single-Modality Pre-Training",
            "content": "Single-modality pre-training serves as the bedrock of perception, aiming to extract intrinsic semantic and geometric features from individual sensor streams without the aid of cross-modal supervision. Given their ubiquity in autonomous systems, we primarily focus on Camera and LiDAR modalities in this subsection. Mastering these single-modality representations is prerequisite for effective sensor fusion and interaction, as it ensures that each branch of multi-modal system contributes robust, high-quality features to the unified world model. 4.1.1 LiDAR-Only Pre-Training LiDAR sensors provide precise and metric-accurate 3D measurements, making them indispensable for tasks requiring fine-grained geometric perception, such as object detection and occupancy prediction. Unlike cameras, LiDAR data is inherently sparse, unordered, and lacks texture, necessitating specialized pre-training objectives to capture underlying topological structures and temporal dynamics. As illustrated in Fig. 4, current research focuses on three primary paradigms to forge robust 3D representations from unlabeled point 10 clouds: Masked Reconstruction for structural understanding, Contrastive Learning for spatial invariance, and Temporal Forecasting for dynamic world modeling. Masked Reconstruction and Structural Completion. Drawing inspiration from Masked Autoencoders (MAE) in general vision [63] and NLP [35], this paradigm forces the network to infer unseen geometric structures from partial observations, thereby learning holistic spatial priors. To handle the irregularity of point clouds, approaches such as GD-MAE [263] and BEV-MAE [135] leverage regular 2D/3D grids for structured masking, while MAELi [108] explicitly reconstructs intensity values to incorporate surface reflectivity properties. MVJAR [248] and Occupancy-MAE [164] also operate on voxelized features to enforce spatial consistency. Recent advances extend this concept to the temporal dimension. T-MAE [233] and LSV-MAE [30] reconstruct sequence-level motion patterns. Furthermore, AD-L-JEPA [315] moves beyond voxel reconstruction to latent space prediction, focusing on learning abstract relational reasoning rather than low-level details. Contrastive Learning and Spatial Invariance. Contrastive learning aims to learn discriminative feature spaces where semantically similar points or scenes are pulled together. This paradigm has evolved from point-level discrimination to multi-scale hierarchical understanding. PointContrast [243] pioneered this direction by optimizing point-level invariance across augmented views, while DepthContrast [299] utilized singleview depth maps to construct informative pairs. Subsequent research has scaled this objective to various spatial hierarchies: Patch/Proposal-level methods [169, 194, 274] focus on object-centric features; BEV-level approaches [64, 190, 280] align features in the birds-eye view for downstream perception tasks; and Scene-level methods [29, 67] capture global context. This hierarchical evolution demonstrates the versatility of contrastive objectives in encoding geometry at different granularities. Figure 4 Schematic illustration of representative LiDAR-only pre-training paradigms. To learn robust geometric representations from sparse point clouds without annotations, methods typically adopt three strategies: (a) Masked Autoencoding (MAE), which reconstructs missing structures to learn local geometry; (b) Contrastive Learning, which enforces view-invariant feature discrimination; and (c) Temporal Forecasting, which predicts future frames to capture dynamic scene evolution. Temporal Forecasting and Predictive Modeling. Moving beyond static perception, forecasting-based pre-training leverages the sequential nature of LiDAR streams to anticipate future states, serving as precursor to predictive world models. Early works like ALSO [14] and 4D-Occ [95] formulate pre-training as occupancy or flow prediction, enabling the model to fill in future geometric voids. Recent frameworks such as Copilot4D [292] and UnO [3] explicitly predict point cloud sequences, fostering temporally consistent representations. Advanced methods further incorporate complex interactions: PICTURE [251] and UNIT [191] introduce mutual information maximization and spatio-temporal clustering, while CooPre [301] and TREND [24] extend forecasting to multiagent cooperative scenarios. These approaches equip models with the predictive capacity essential for planning in dynamic environments. 4.1.2 Camera-Only Pre-Training Visual data from camera offers the rich semantic information for scene understanding. While supervised pre-training on generic datasets like ImageNet [34] and MS-COCO [133] remains standard initialization strategy for common vision backbones (e.g., ResNet [60] and ViT [38]), it suffers from domain gap when applied to the complex, 3D-centric tasks of autonomous systems. Consequently, the field has pivoted towards Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) on domain-specific onboard data, evolving through three key paradigms: Domain and Temporal Consistency. Handling domain shifts and exploiting temporal continuity are fundamental for robust vision. INoD [65] addresses the domain generalization challenge by formulating dataset affiliation prediction pretext task, interleaving feature maps from disjoint domains to learn invariant representations. Capitalizing on the sequential nature of driving videos, TempO [109] treats region-level feature ordering as sequence prediction problem. By modeling the temporal evolution of features, it enables the visual encoder to capture motion dynamics and causality, which are critical for planning. Geometric Lifting to BEV. Bridging the gap between 2D images and 3D perception is core objective. LetsMap [50] pioneers label-efficient approach for semantic Birds-Eye-View (BEV) mapping. It leverages the spatial constraints inherent in monocular sequences to enforce consistency between perspective and BEV representations, effectively lifting 2D semantics into metric space without relying on expensive dense annotations or LiDAR depth. Neural Fields and Volumetric Reasoning. The most recent frontier involves incorporating implicit 3D representations into visual pre-training. NeRF-MAE [77] represents paradigm shift, adapting Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). By using posed RGB images to reconstruct masked volumetric tokens, it forces the transformer to internalize 3D spatial layouts and view-dependent effects. Similarly, VisionPAD [288] introduces voxel-centric framework that combines voxel warping with multi-frame photometric consistency. This allows the model to learn fine-grained motion and geometry directly from image streams, offering scalable alternative to depth-supervised methods. Collectively, these methods illustrate trajectory from learning 2D semantics to mastering 3D geometry and temporal dynamics, enabling cameras to function as standalone sensors for spatial intelligence."

            "title": "4.2 Multi-Modality Pre-Training",
            "content": "While single-modality pre-training establishes the foundational feature space, forging true Spatial Intelligence requires the synergy of heterogeneous sensors. The physical world manifests in diverse signals: cameras capture dense semantic texture, while LiDAR and radar provide sparse but metric-accurate geometry and kinematics. Multi-modality pre-training aims to bridge the semantic-geometric gap by learning unified representations that leverage the complementary strengths of these modalities. We categorize these approaches based on the information flow direction: LiDAR-Centric (distilling visual semantics into 3D geometry), Camera-Centric (injecting geometric priors into 2D features), and Unified Frameworks (jointly optimizing modality-agnostic representations). This taxonomy highlights how crossmodal interactions evolve from simple alignment to unified world modeling. 4.2.1 LiDAR-Centric Pre-Training LiDAR sensors excel at capturing precise 3D structures but suffer from inherent semantic sparsity and lack of texture. Conversely, the computer vision community has cultivated powerful foundation models [20, 96, 182] that encapsulate rich, open-world semantic knowledge. LiDAR-centric pre-training aims to bridge this asymmetry by treating visual signals as Privileged Information during training. The goal is to transfer the semantic richness of 2D images into 3D point cloud networks, enabling them to hallucinate semantic features even when cameras are absent during inference. As illustrated in Fig. 5, this paradigm has evolved through four key strategies: Masked Reconstruction with Visual Guidance. Integrating cross-modal cues from camera images into the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) framework [63] enhances structural learning for LiDAR point cloud. I2P-MAE [293] and CM3D [94] condition the reconstruction of masked LiDAR tokens on visible image patches, forcing the network to infer 3D geometry from 2D semantic context. ImageTo360 [186] and EUCA-3DP [200] extend this to full-scene scales, leveraging BEV context to promote holistic spatial reasoning that fuses visual texture with geometric occupancy. Cross-Modal Contrastive Alignment. The foundational approach involves aligning 2D and 3D feature spaces through contrastive learning. By maximizing the similarity between corresponding image pixels and projected LiDAR points, models learn to associate geometric clusters with visual concepts. SimIPU [121] and SLidR [189] pioneered this by constructing point-pixel pairs to enforce local semantic consistency. Recent extensions like ST-SLidR [157] and Cross-Modal SSL [19] incorporate temporal constraints and region-aware affinity, improving the robustness of alignment against calibration errors and dynamic objects. Knowledge Distillation from Foundation Models. Moving beyond simple alignment, recent works leverage 2D foundation models as teachers to distill open-vocabulary semantics into 3D students. Seal [145] and ScaLR [180] utilize the segmentation capability of SAM and vision transformers to generate high-quality pseudo-labels or soft feature targets for point clouds. CSC [23] and OLIVINE [297] further refine this process by incorporating hierarchical clustering and class-aware gating, ensuring that the distilled knowledge respects the geometric boundaries of 3D objects. This strategy effectively imparts sight to blind LiDAR networks. Temporal Dynamics and Motion Transfer. Static cross-modal alignment is insufficient for dynamic autonomous systems in real world. SuperFlow [253] and PRED [262] introduce temporal supervision by transferring motion knowledge from video to point cloud sequences. By aligning the temporal evolution of features across modalities, these methods enable LiDAR backbones to capture long-horizon dynamics [256], serving as stepping stone towards predictive world models. Figure 5 Taxonomy of LiDAR-centric pre-training methodologies. To bridge the semantic gap of point clouds, these approaches leverage images as privileged information during training. The main paradigms involve: (a) Cross-modal MAE-based Pre-Training, which incorporates 2D-guided masking strategies to enhance geometric reconstruction and structural understanding; (b) Cross-modal Contrastive/Distillation PreTraining, which either enforces feature alignment between modalities or directly transfers rich open-vocabulary semantics from pre-trained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to 3D encoders; and (c) Temporal Pre-Training, which exploits video-LiDAR sequences to capture motion dynamics and enforce spatiotemporal consistency. In summary, LiDAR-centric pre-training transforms point cloud networks from pure geometric processors into semantically aware perception engines, significantly enhancing performance in detection and semantic segmentation tasks, particularly in data-scarce regimes. Table 4 provides comprehensive taxonomy of these LiDAR-based techniques, categorizing them by input modality, proxy tasks, and downstream applications. 4.2.2 Camera-Centric Pre-Training Camera-centric pre-training addresses the ill-posed nature of monocular perception: recovering 3D structures from 2D projections. While cameras are cost-effective and ubiquitous, they lack intrinsic and accurate depth. To overcome this, recent methods utilize LiDAR data as Geometric Supervisor during pre-training. By injecting precise depth and structural priors into visual backbones, these models learn to hallucinate 3D geometry from images alone, retaining efficient camera-only inference while benefiting from LiDAR-grade supervision. As visually taxonomized in Fig. 6, this domain bifurcates into two primary streams: Geometric Perception (via explicit depth or feature distillation) and Predictive World Modeling (via forecasting or neural rendering). detailed overview of these vision-centric methodologies, including their proxy tasks and key contributions, is summarized in Table 5. 13 Table 5 Overview of camera-centric and unified pre-training methodologies.

The primary goal here is to equip vision models with spatial awareness by aligning 2D features with 3D structural constraints. Explicit Depth Pre-Training (Fig. 6 (a)) serves as the foundational approach. Early works like DD3D [176] and DEPT [123] leverage pseudo-depth supervision from LiDAR to initialize 3D object detectors, effectively grounding visual features in metric space. Moving beyond simple depth maps, Distillation-based Pre-Training (Fig. 6 (b)) aligns latent representations. OccNet [207] and SelfOcc [75] advance this by learning to predict dense 3D occupancy grids, utilizing LiDAR occupancy as ground-truth supervisor. Furthermore, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has been adapted for geometric consistency: GeoMIM [140] and MIM4D [322] reconstruct masked image patches by cross-referencing with projected LiDAR points, forcing the network to internalize 3D spatial correspondences within the feature extraction process. Figure 6 Overview of camera-centric pre-training paradigms (LiDARto-Vision). These methods aim to inject 3D geometric priors into 2D visual backbones using LiDAR as supervisor. Key approaches include: (a) Depth Estimation for explicit geometry learning; (b) Feature Distillation to align 2D-3D latent spaces; and (c) Forecasting and (d) Generative Rendering, which empower vision models to hallucinate 3D structures and predict future dynamics from monocular inputs. Predictive World Modeling: Forecasting and Rendering. This stream represents the transition from static perception to dynamic simulation, requiring models to understand temporal evolution and photorealistic synthesis. Forecasting-based Pre-Training (Fig. 6 (c)) compels models to predict future states from current video streams, thereby internalizing the physics of the environment. ViDAR [270] pioneers \"Visual Point Cloud Forecasting,\" treating future LiDAR points as supervision signal for historical visual inputs. Extensions like DriveWorld [166] and UniScene [165] scale this to 4D occupancy, learning spatio-temporal abstractions that facilitate long-term planning. Complementing this, Rendering-based Pre-Training (Fig. 6 (d)) exploits the differentiability of neural fields. Frontier methods like GaussianPretrain [249] and GaussianOcc [45] incorporate 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [92] into the pre-training loop. By enforcing photometric consistency through differentiable rendering, these models learn continuous, high-fidelity geometric representations that surpass discrete voxels in precision. Finally, generative approaches such as GenAD [265] and OccSora [214] integrate these concepts to function as neural simulators, paving the way for end-to-end agents capable of reasoning about future consequences [232, 269]. 14 4.2.3 Unified Pre-Training Unified pre-training represents the convergence of multi-modal learning. Unlike asymmetric distillation (LiDAR-centric or Camera-centric), which treats one modality as primary, unified frameworks jointly optimize encoders for heterogeneous modalities within shared latent space. As explicitly illustrated in Fig. 7, canonical unified framework processes data through cohesive pipeline encompassing masking, alignment, and reconstruction. This paradigm can be deconstructed into three critical phases: Multi-Modal Masking and Encoding. The pipeline begins by treating raw sensor inputs as discrete tokens. As depicted in the Multi-Modal Masking stage of Fig. 7, methods like UniPAD [264] and UniM2AE [323] apply randomized masking to both LiDAR points and image patches. This forces the encoders to learn robust local features rather than relying on redundant shortcuts. Specifically, the visual branch typically employs Camera Encoder, while the geometric branch utilizes LiDAR Encoder to extract high-dimensional primitives from sparse inputs. View Transformation and Unified Fusion. To bridge the dimensional gap between 2D images and 3D points, the framework transforms heterogeneous features into common coordinate system. As shown in the center of Fig. 7, visual features undergo View Transform [111, 122, 264], while point features are processed via 3D-to-BEV Flattening. These streams converge at the Multi-Modal Fusion and Interaction stage, resulting in Unified Representation manifesting typically as BEV Features or dense Volumetric Features. Approaches like BEVWorld [298] and GS3 [138] leverage this shared latent space to enforce strict geometric consistency between modalities. Figure 7 Illustration of unified multi-modal pre-training frameworks. Unlike asymmetric distillation, unified approaches jointly optimize Camera and LiDAR encoders within shared representation space. This paradigm facilitates the learning of modality-agnostic features that integrate both semantic richness and geometric precision, forging holistic basis for Spatial Intelligence. Generative Reconstruction. The final objective is to validate the understanding of the scene by reconstructing the masked or missing information. The right side of Fig. 7 demonstrates that the unified representation is decoded to simultaneously reconstruct the original LiDAR geometry, Image texture, and often auxiliary Depth Maps. By optimizing for this holistic reconstruction objective, the model learns modality-agnostic features that integrate semantic richness with geometric precision, ensuring robustness even when individual sensors are compromised during inference [25, 257, 295]. In conclusion, unified pre-training moves beyond simple sensor fusion; it forges holistic understanding of the physical world that is independent of the specific sensing apparatus, key characteristic of true Spatial Intelligence."

            "content": "In complex open-world environments, reliance solely on cameras and LiDAR can lead to perceptual failures under adverse conditions, such as severe weather, high-speed motion, or extreme lighting changes [100, 104, 105, 244]. To forge robust Spatial Intelligence, incorporating complementary sensors becomes imperative. Millimeter-wave radar offers resilience against fog and rain via Doppler signatures, while Event Cameras (neuromorphic sensors) capture microsecond-level dynamics with high dynamic range. Integrating these modalities into pre-training frameworks not only enhances system reliability but also extends the operational design domain of autonomous agents. In this subsection, we analyze representation learning paradigms specialized for these sensors. 15 4.3.1 Radar Pre-Training Radar point clouds differ significantly from LiDAR in their scarcity, noise characteristics (clutter), and unique velocity channels. Pre-training methods in this domain focus on suppressing noise and extracting meaningful structural features through three key approaches: Cross-Modal Alignment and Supervision. Due to the semantic sparsity of radar returns, aligning them with richer modalities is standard strategy. AssociationNet [37] utilizes well-structured LiDAR point clouds to supervise radar feature learning, enhancing geometric consistency. RadarContrast [226] and RiCL [33] employ contrastive learning to enforce invariance between radar representations and their multi-view or temporal counterparts, effectively grounding radar features in stable metric space. Masked Modeling for Sparse Signals. Adapting masked reconstruction to radar involves dealing with extreme sparsity. MVRAE [314] and RSLM [179] introduce autoencoding frameworks that reconstruct raw radar signals, enabling the model to learn spatiotemporal priors and filter out multi-path noise. Radar-Rep [272] and Radical [58] further refine this by designing radar-specific masking strategies and curriculum learning to handle the high variance in signal quality. Domain Adaptation and Simulation. To bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world radar data, domainadaptive strategies are crucial. SS-RODNet [319, 320] facilitates transfer learning across domains, while U-MLPNet [258] explores lightweight inductive biases to enable efficient radar perception on edge devices. 4.3.2 Event Camera Pre-Training Event cameras capture asynchronous brightness changes, offering paradigm shift for high-speed perception. Pre-training methodologies here must address the non-grid, asynchronous nature of event streams: Spatiotemporal Reconstruction. Reconstructing dense signals from sparse events forces the model to understand scene dynamics. MEM [97] and DMM [76] adapt masked modeling to event streams, reconstructing spatial structures from fragmented temporal triggers. ECDP [266] and ECDDP [267] focus on future frame prediction, leveraging the high temporal resolution of events to forecast motion with exceptional precision. STP [129] introduces specialized transformer architectures to simultaneously model the spatial sparsity and temporal continuity inherent in event data. Cross-Modal Synergy. Integrating events with standard RGB frames combines high dynamic range with semantic texture. EventBind [308] aligns asynchronous event streams with synchronous RGB frames in shared latent space, enabling semantic understanding even in high-motion blur scenarios. EventFly [100] further demonstrates the utility of this synergy for agile navigation in aerial robotics, where latency is critical bottleneck. 4.3.3 Auxiliary Modalities Beyond primary perception sensors, other onboard instruments serve as critical sources of weak supervision or geometric constraints during pre-training [17, 22, 47], rather than just as input modalities: Inertial Measurement Units (IMU): Instead of learning IMU representations in isolation, recent works utilize IMU data to enforce ego-motion consistency. By providing accurate acceleration and orientation priors, IMUs supervise the temporal alignment of vision and LiDAR backbones, essential for learning physically plausible world models. GPS and Localization Signals: Global positioning data provides coarse-grained location context. In large-scale pre-training, GPS traces are often used to retrieve topologically neighboring scenes or to enforce trajectory consistency in long-horizon prediction tasks. Thermal/Infrared Sensors: In safety-critical applications, these sensors provide distinct signatures for living beings (e.g., pedestrians and animals) that are invisible to standard cameras at night. Pretraining on thermal data typically follows domain adaptation paradigms to transfer RGB-based semantic knowledge to the thermal domain. 16 Table 6 Comparative analysis of 3D object detection on the nuScenes benchmark [17].

            "content": "To empirically substantiate the efficacy of the discussed pre-training paradigms, we evaluate their impact on core 3D perception tasks: 3D Object Detection and LiDAR Semantic Segmentation. These tasks serve as the definitive litmus test for Spatial Intelligence, assessing whether learned representations can translate pretext objectives (e.g., reconstruction and forecasting) into precise geometric localization and fine-grained semantic understanding. In this subsection, we synthesize key findings from major benchmarks, highlighting how different pre-training strategies reshape the performance landscape. 4.4.1 3D Object Detection 3D object detection requires the model to identify and localize objects within metric space, task that demands both high-level semantics and low-level geometric precision. Quantitative results on the nuScenes benchmark  (Table 6)  provide compelling evidence for the superiority of Unified Pre-Training. As shown in the comparative analysis, frameworks that jointly optimize multi-modal encoders consistently outperform camera-only baselines. Notably, UniM2AE [323] achieves state-of-the-art performance with 71.1 mAP and 73.8 NDS, representing significant gain over the strong FocalFormer3D [28] baseline. Similarly, UniPAD [264] demonstrates remarkable robustness, boosting the UVTR-M [115] baseline by +4.5 mAP to reach 69.9 mAP. This suggests that learning shared latent space for vision and geometry allows the model to capture complementary features that are otherwise lost in late-fusion pipelines, proving that unified multi-modal masking is superior to disjoint training strategies. 4.4.2 LiDAR Segmentation LiDAR semantic segmentation, involving dense point-level classification, is the rigorous testing ground for the Semantic-Geometric Gap. Since point clouds inherently lack texture, performance on this task directly reflects models ability to hallucinate semantics from geometry. The comparisons in Table 7 reveal decisive trend: Camera-to-LiDAR Distillation is indispensable, particularly for Data Efficiency. Approaches utilizing visual priors consistently surpass training-from-scratch baselines, with advantages magnified in data-scarce regimes. For instance, with only 1% of labeled data, the random baseline yields poor mIoU of 30.30. In stark contrast, distillation-based methods like OLIVINE [297] and LiMoE [254] achieve 50.58 and 49.60 mIoU respectively, effectively doubling the performance of the baseline. This indicates that self-supervised pre-training effectively unlocks the latent geometric structure of unlabeled data, significantly reducing the dependency on costly manual annotations. Crucially, the results uncover Scaling Law Transfer phenomenon. Advanced distillation methods like LiMoE [254] not only achieve state-of-the-art results on the full dataset (77.27 mIoU) but also demonstrate 17 Table 7 Benchmark of cross-modal pre-training for LiDAR semantic segmentation on nuScenes [17]. We evaluate the transferability of visual semantics to 3D point clouds via knowledge distillation. The results highlight performance gains across varying data regimes (e.g., 1% vs. 100% labeled data), underscoring the data efficiency of LiDAR-centric pre-training.

This paradigm manifests in two key directions: Auto-Labeling Data Engines and Open-Vocabulary Representation Learning. Auto-Labeling as Scalable Data Engine. The most immediate impact of foundation models is breaking the annotation bottleneck. Instead of relying on human labelers, recent works utilize pre-trained VLMs [182, 217] to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for sensor data. CLIP2Scene [26] and OpenScene [177] pioneered the distillation of 2D vision-language features into 3D point clouds, effectively automating semantic segmentation.

The field is transitioning from modular perception-planning pipelines to unified World Models that can simulate future states and plan end-to-end within shared space. From Discriminative to Generative Planning. Traditional end-to-end planning often relied on explicit perception outputs (e.g., bounding boxes and vectorized maps) or decoupled feature maps. Recent breakthroughs, however, are driven by Generative World Models [106, 269, 306]. Moving beyond discrete label prediction, models like OccWorld [305] and GenAD [265] learn to predict the future evolution of the 3D world (e.g., 4D Occupancy flow) conditioned on ego-actions. This predictive learning objective forces the model to internalize scene dynamics, causal relationships, and object interactions.

Parallel to pure latent modeling, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the emergence of VLA frameworks that emphasize interpretability and open-world reasoning [5, 139, 224]. Approaches like OccVLA [143] and DriveVLA-W0 [118] tokenize visual input and project them into the LLMs context window alongside text.

A fundamental dissonance remains between the rich semantic knowledge\nencapsulated in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the precise metric requirements of autonomous control.\nWhile VLMs excel at open-vocabulary recognition [5, 139, 182, 217], they often lack the fine-grained spatial\ngrounding necessary to localize it with centimeter-level accuracy. Bridging the gap between high-level semantic\nreasoning and low-level geometric constraints without compromising either remains a formidable theoretical\nand engineering challenge [143, 232].",
            "content": "Data-Centric Bottlenecks and Corner Cases. The scaling laws of foundation models are increasingly hitting diminishing returns regarding data quality. The primary challenge has shifted from acquiring more data to mining valuable dataspecifically, long-tail corner cases and safety-critical scenarios [49, 204, 281]. Current 20 pre-training objectives treat all data samples equally, often wasting computation on repetitive driving patterns while under-weighting rare, high-value events [264, 270]. Furthermore, utilizing foundation models for auto-labeling introduces epistemic uncertainty that is difficult to filter from the training pipeline. Real-Time Inference of Foundation Models. There is growing disparity between the computational demands of state-of-the-art pre-trained models and the strict latency/power constraints of onboard edge devices [85, 234]. While cloud-based pre-training leverages unlimited resources, distilling these massive teacher models into lightweight, real-time student networks without catastrophic performance drops is an ongoing bottleneck for deployment [253, 256, 294]."

            "title": "6.2 Future Directions",
            "content": "While recent advancements have laid the foundation for spatial intelligence, several critical frontiers remain to be conquered to achieve robust, human-level autonomy. Physically Consistent World Simulators. Although emerging Generative World Models [106, 118, 306] can synthesize plausible futures, they often suffer from hallucinations that violate physical laws [126]. key future direction is to enforce Physical Consistency within the pre-training objective. By integrating differentiable physics engines or explicit geometric constraints into the generation process [8, 118, 143, 227], future models must evolve from merely generating visual pixels to simulating realistic physical interactions, thereby serving as reliable training environments for safety-critical policies. Trustworthy and Real-Time Embodied VLA. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models [71, 84, 118, 143] demonstrate promise but face significant hurdles in real-world deployment: high inference latency and lack of interpretability. Future research should bridge the gap between heavy foundation models and the millisecondlevel reaction requirements of autonomous systems. This necessitates exploring lightweight VLA architectures, efficient tokenization strategies, and mechanisms for uncertainty quantification to ensure that end-to-end decision-making is not only intelligent but also trustworthy and verifiable [43, 113, 223, 278]. 4D Semantic-Geometric Unification. The transition from discrete voxels to continuous representations like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [83, 92, 141] is underway. However, current 3DGS methods largely focus on visual rendering quality rather than semantic understanding. The next frontier lies in Semantic Liftingimbuing these continuous geometric primitives with dense semantic and instance-level attributes over time. Pre-training tasks that enforce spatiotemporal consistency on Gaussian attributes [11, 249] will be pivotal for enabling agents to not just view the scene, but to manipulate and interact with specific objects in dynamic 4D world. System 2 Reasoning for Long-Tail Safety. Existing pre-training paradigms excel at pattern recognition (System 1 ) but struggle with rare, complex scenarios requiring logical deduction. Future systems will integrate System 2 capabilities [71, 206], potentially via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from LLMs [219, 224, 231, 284]. The goal is to move beyond passive explanation to active Causal Reasoningenabling the vehicle to counterfactually simulate what if scenarios and override reactive policies when facing novel, long-tail safety hazards."

            "title": "7 Conclusion",
            "content": "In this paper, we have presented systematic analysis of multi-modal pre-training for autonomous systems, characterizing the evolution from modality-specific pre-training to unified foundation models as the cornerstone of Spatial Intelligence. By structuring datasets and methodologies across autonomous vehicles, drones, and other robotic systems, we demonstrated how integrating complementary sensor modalities (specifically camera and LiDAR) creates representations that are both semantically rich and geometrically precise. Our analysis confirms that leveraging pre-trained foundation models is no longer optional but essential for achieving open-world generalization and mitigating the scarcity of annotated 3D data. Looking ahead, the field stands at critical inflection point. As demonstrated, the paradigm is shifting from passive perception to active, embodied reasoning. Future breakthroughs will likely stem from bridging the semantic-geometric gap through Generative World Models that serve as neural simulators, and from the development of end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that unify perception with decisionmaking. Furthermore, equipping these systems with explicit reasoning capabilities will be pivotal for handling 21 the long-tail unpredictability of real-world environments. Ultimately, the transition from seeing to acting and reasoning represents the next frontier. Continued advancements in these generative and embodied pre-training paradigms will be instrumental in forging autonomous systems that are not only robust and scalable but possess true Spatial Intelligence for safe and real-world deployment."
