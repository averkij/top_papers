Introduction intelligence has driven the The pursuit of multimodal development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [49, 61, 68], which typically adopt moda pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., CLIPular design: ViT [15, 62]) extracts image features, Large Language Model (LLM) [2, 16, 38, 5860] processes text, and lightweight projector aligns the two modalities. This framework achieves strong performance through multi-stage pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and post-training on multimodal datasets [3, 18, 49, 76, 77, 91]. While effective, 1https://github.com/bytedance/SAIL Figure 1. (A) Data scaling curve for Modular Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and SAIL, our Single Transformerbased MLLM. As pretraining data increases, the single transformer SAIL shows sharper performance gain, demonstrating its superior data scalability. (B) Comparison to existing Single Transformer-based MLLMs: our SAIL pushes the performance boundaries on both vision tasks and vision-language tasks. this modular MLLM paradigm inherently fragments multimodal processing, reinforces reliance on pretrained visual encoders, which may limit deployment flexibility and scalability [11, 21, 54]. promising alternative is to eliminate the visual encoder entirely and process raw image patches and text tokens within single Transformer. This unified architecture removes modality-specific modules, enabling parameter sharing and end-to-end learning of vision-language interactions. Previous works [11, 21, 54] have primarily explored the architecture design, training data, and methods of Single Transformer-based MLLMs. However, little exploration has been given to their fundamental properties, such as scalability, cross-modal information flow patterns, and visual representation capabilities. deeper understanding of these properties is crucial for unlocking the full potential of Single Transformer-based MLLMs. In this work, we present an experimental analysis of the fundamental properties of Single Transformer-based MLLMs and compare them to modular MLLMs (e.g. 1 LLaVA [49]). Addtionally, in the absence of pre-trained visual encoder, Single Transformers have to learn visual representations from scratch. Thus, an intriguing question arises: can trained Single Transformer emerge as strong vision encoder? We conduct series of experiments to train and study our Single trAnsformer model for vIsion and Language (SAIL). While we do not propose novel architecture designs, we introduce necessary modifications to enable the model to process different modalities in unified architecture. In its micro architecture design, we address the different spatial characteristics of 2D images and 1D text data by employing mixed attention mechanism: bidirectional attention for image patches and causal attention for text tokens, combined with multimodal rotary position embedding. Through model and data scaling, SAIL achieves performance on vision-language benchmarks comparable to modular MLLMs, while also functioning as highperforming vision backbone, as shown in Figure 1. More concretely, our empirical analysis uncovers following striking advantages of Single Transformer architectures: (i) Superior Data Scaling: In controlled experiments, SAIL exhibits steeper performance gains as pretraining data scales. While LLaVA-style modular MLLMs initially perform well, our models performance becomes very close to theirs when pretrained on 512M samples, as shown in Figure 1(A). This suggests that unified architectures can effectively leverage large-scale data and potentially match the performance of modular MLLMs. (ii) Vision Centric Information Flow Pattern: Through analysis of attention distributions, we observe that Single Transformers assign significantly higher attention scores to image tokens during token prediction compared to modular MLLMs. This indicates that the information flow in Single Transformer MLLMs is more direct, with visual tokens influencing prediction tokens more prominently, highlighting vision-centric approach to decision-making. (iii) Vision Encoder Functioning: Our experiments further demonstrate that the pretrained Single Transformer inherently serves as powerful vision encoder. Comprehensive evaluations on vision-centric tasks, such as image classification and semantic segmentation, show that the model learns rich visual representations during multimodal pretraining. These representations enhance its capacity for both semantic-level comprehension (e.g., object categorization) and pixel-level understanding (e.g., fine-grained segmentation masks), bridging high-level abstraction and lowlevel visual reasoning within unified architecture. our findings In summary, that Single Transformer-based MLLMs hold great promise in surpassing modular MLLMs in terms of leveraging large-scale data, forming direct vision-centric information pathways, and functioning as effective vision encoders. We hope indicate our empirical findings inspire further research to refine and enhance Single Transformer architecture, ultimately driving advancements in multimodal intelligence from new perspective. 2. Related Work 2.1. Paradigms in Vision-Language Model Design Modular MLLMs with Visual Encoders. The prevailing approach in MLLM design employs modular architectures [3, 49, 61, 68, 77] that rely on pretrained vision encoders (e.g., CLIP-ViT [15, 62], InternViT [14]) to process visual inputs. The visual features extracted from these frozen encoders are then aligned with LLM input spaces via linear [7, 49, 75, 91] or cross-attention layers [1, 33]. While this module design enables effective transfer of pretrained visual-language knowledge, it also introduces several limitations. First, incorporating separate ViT encoder significantly slows down both training and inference, increasing deployment complexity and requiring costly infrastructureespecially when compared to single transformer unified model. Second, common strategies for integrating visual features, such as direct mapping into LLM inputs [7, 49, 91] or sharing them across LLM layers [1, 33], often struggle to reconcile the inherent differences between images and text representations. Finally, as model scale, balancing the interactions between the the encoder, LLM, and alignment layers becomes increasingly challenging [11, 54]. Thus, in this work, we explore single transformer-based MLLM architecture that eliminates the ViT encoder and alignment components to overcome these challenges. Single Transformer-based MLLMs Without Visual Encoders. Emerging research explores end-to-end architectures that process raw image patches and text tokens through single Transformer, bypassing visual encoders entirely. These monolithic designs fall into two categories: continuous tokenization and discrete tokenization. Continuous tokenization, exemplified by Fuyu-8B [5] and SOLO [11], directly maps patches to LLM embeddings via linear projections, enabling flexible resolution handling but requiring massive pretraining data. Discrete tokenization, adopted by Chameleon [67] and Emu3 [79], employs VQ-VAE tokenizers to compress images into discrete tokens, trading pixel-level fidelity for generation capabilities. While later efforts such as EVE [21] and MonoInternVL [54] demonstrate the feasibility of encoder-free training, critical gaps remain: (1) Existing methods rely on extra designs and auxiliary loss [21], complicating training pipelines; (2) The scaling laws and fundamental properties of purely end-to-end trained models remain poorly understood; (3) Vision-language interaction in shared parameter spaces lacks systematic analysismost prior MLLMs 2 default to causal attention for processing image-text sequences. In this work, we reveal that enabling bidirectional attention between image patches significantly enhances visual representation learning, addressing key limitation in current designs. More importantly, our study bridges these gaps by establishing foundational principles for training scalable, self-contained single-transformer MLLMs. 2.2. Vision Representation Learning Learning effective vision representations is core challenge in computer vision research, with extensive works [4, 19, 20, 26, 31, 80] dedicated to this problem. With the proliferation of large-scale web-sourced image-text datasets [6, 27, 63], recent methods leverage this data to train deep visual representations via three primary paradigms: Text as Classification Labels. Early methods used textual descriptions as weak supervision by extracting categorical labels from captions. For example, frameworks like Tag2Text [34] and RAM [89] used ViTs [23] to predict noun-based pseudo-labels from datasets like CC12M [6]. CatLIP [57] scaled labels to millions using object-centric supervision, and SuperClass [35] directly used tokenized text tokens as classification categories. Image-Text Contrastive Learning Contrastive pretraining, as exemplified by CLIP [15, 62] and ALIGN [37], aligns global image-text embeddings within shared latent space. Subsequent works [8, 14, 42, 45, 78, 87] focused on enhancing CLIPs performance and improving training efficiency. Text as Autoregressive Targets. Caption generation as pretext task is another approach for visual representation learning. SimVLM [80] trains encoder-decoder architectures to autoregressively predict captions, while CapPa [71] trains vision encoders through sequence prediction. These methods often retain modular designs or auxiliary components like contrastive losses [83]. Our work aligns with this category but removes architectural fragmentation by jointly modeling image patches and text tokens in single Transformer. We find that the pre-trained Single Transformer learns transferable vision representations, enabling it to handle downstream multimodal understanding tasks and function as vision encoder without modifications. 3. SAIL: Training Single Transformer for Vision and Language 3.1. Model Architecture SAIL is built upon unified Transformer architecture (Figure 2(A)) that processes multimodal inputs through streamlined, modality-specific preprocessing. For text, raw input is tokenized using the language models tokenizer and then transformed into embeddings via the textual embedding module. For images, we partition the input into fixedsize patches and project them into continuous embeddings via linear projection. Additionally, we maintain list of special tokens explicitly designed for visual modality encoding: <vision> and </vision> tokens mark the beginning and end of an image patch span, respectively. In multimodal scenarios, such as image-text pairs, these embeddings are concatenated into single sequence and fed into the Transformer, enabling joint cross-modal interactions through unified self-attention layers. This design eliminates the need for modality-specific encoders, which efficiently processess heterogeneous data within singletransformer framework. Bidirectional attention within image patches. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [41, 48, 49, 91] predominantly adopt causal attention for autoregressive sequence modeling, our experiments reveal that enabling full bidirectional attention among tokens from the same image significantly enhances visual representation learning and boosts downstream vision-language task performance. Note that previous Single Transformer works [11, 21, 54, 79] have only utilized causal attention, without exploring the potential of mixed attention mechanisms. As illustrated in Figure 2(B), for SAIL we implement mixed attention scheme: (1) For text tokens, we preserve causal attention to maintain autoregressive generation capabilities, allowing each token to attend only to its predecessors. (2) For image tokens, we activate full bidirectional attention within each image patch group, empowering every visual token to interact with all others in the same image. This design captures holistic spatial relationships and contextual dependencies among visual elements, addressing the under-explored potential of attention mechanisms in cross-modal alignment. The improved interaction paradigm not only refines vision-language feature fusion but also provides stronger inductive biases for complex reasoning tasks. Multimodal Rotary Position Embeddings. Following [77], we implement Multimodal RoPE (M-RoPE) in SAIL to harmonize positional modeling for multimodal inputs. The method decomposes positional encoding into two axes: height, and width. For text tokens, all axes share uniform position IDs (aligned with 1D-RoPE), whereas for images, height/width IDs adaptively map to token coordinates, as is shown in Fig 2(C). Notably, position indexing is sequentially initialized across modalities (e.g., starting from images before extending to subsequent text), preserving inter-modal consistency. M-RoPE not only improves positional sensitivity but also constrains absolute position magnitudes for visual tokens, facilitating robust generalization to extended sequences in inference. 3 Figure 2.

Pretraining apply two-stage We curriculum to progressively strengthen the visual perception of SAIL while preserving its inherent language capabilities. Stage 1: Accelerated Visual Knowledge Acquisition. In this stage, we pretrain SAIL on large-scale image-text pairs to rapidly bootstrap its visual understanding. To maximize data throughput, we uniformly resize all images to lower resolution (e.g., 224 224), reducing multimodal sequence lengths and enabling the model to process more samples within fixed training time. To prevent catastrophic forgetting of linguistic knowledge, we interleave pure text corpora with multimodal data during training. This hybrid approach ensures efficient exposure to visual patterns while maintaining robust language proficiency. Stage 2: Enhancing Any-Resolution Image Understanding. Real-world applications require robustness to images of varying resolutions and aspect ratios, such as documents, charts, or infographics. Following prior works [11, 21], we extend pretraining with an any-resolution strategy: images retain their native resolutions during processing, and positional embeddings adapt dynamically to arbitrary spatial dimensions. This stage further refines SAIL ability to model fine-grained visual details (e.g., tabular structures, text-rich graphics) while continuing to incorporate text-only data for language capability preservation. Pretraining Objective. Throughout both stages, we optimize the standard language modeling loss only on text tokens. Image patches and special visual tokens are excluded from loss computation. 3.3. Supervised Fine-tuning During the Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) stage, we train SAIL on publicly available, multi-source instruction datasets to enhance its understanding of complex linguistic instructions and diverse dialogue patterns critical for realworld deployment. This phase fine-tunes the entire network architecture, focusing on aligning the models responses with human intent through exposure to varied instructional formats and multimodal interactions. Table 1 shows the details of training datasets for pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) across all stages. During Stage 1 pretraining, we utilized mixed multimodal and pure text datasets including Recap-DataComp-1B [43] and SlimPajama [66], with images at resolution of 224x224, totaling 512M image-text pairs. In Stage 2, the pretraining datasets include Capfusion [84], self-curated OCR data from LAION COCO [63], InfinityMM Stage 2 subset [29], and SlimPajama, utilizing the any resolution (AnyRes) strategy, with combined total of 86M image-text pairs along with text data. The SFT stage employed the InfinityMM Stage 3 subset, processed at any resolution, containing 6M image-text pairs. 4 Stage Dataset Img.Res Num Pretraining S1 Pretraining SFT Recap-DataComp-1B [43] SlimPajama [66] Capfusion [84] OCR from LAION COCO [63] InifinityMM Stage 2 subset [29] SlimPajama [66] InifinityMM Stage3 [29] 224x224 AnyRes AnyRes 512M - 60M 7M 19M - 6M Table 1.

Note that these settings represent the default configuration for standard SAIL training, while separate settings are used for scaling experiments and ablation studies. 4. Experiment 4.1. Experimental Settings Evaluation Benchmarks. For evaluation of vision and language tasks, we evaluate SAIL and existing MLLMs on broad range of multimodal benchmarks. Specifically, MLLM benchmarks encompass MMBenchEN [50], SEEDBench-IMG [40], MMVet [85], MME [46], HallusionBench [30], MathVistaMINI [53], and OCRBench [51]. Visual question answering benchmarks include TextVQA [65], ScienceQA-IMG [52], AI2D [39], MMStar [9], RealWorldQA [81]. For evaluation of vision representation learning, we conduct experiments on ImageNet-1K [20] for image classification, ADE20K for semantic segmentation [90], and ARO [86] for attribute, relation, and ordering. Implementation Details. For pretraining, we initialize SAIL from the Mistral-7B-v0.1 base LLM and set the patch size to 14. We modify Megatron [64] to support SAILs multimodal input. Pretraining uses 128 NVIDIA A100 80G GPUs with 2-way tensor parallelism and 64-way data parallelism. The learning rate is set at 5e-5 and decays cosinely to minimum of 5e-6. For training efficiency, we concatenate sequences from different data samples into one long sequence of 32,768 tokens, adjusting the attention mask to ensure that tokens from different samples do not attend to each other. We use round-robin approach to interleave image-text packed sequences and pure text packed sequences, configuring the global batch to contain approximately 16K image-text pairs. For Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the global batch size is set to 512. Training is performed for one epoch with maximum learning rate of 1e-5, following linear warm-up phase and then transitioning to cosine decay schedule. For vision, we load the checkpoint after Stage 1 pretraining and keep it frozen for downstream evaluations, including (1) image classification on ImageNet-1K [20], (2) semantic segmentation on ADE20K [90], and (3) attribute, relation and, ordering on the ARO benchmark [86]. Specifically, (1) for image classification, we utilize an attentionbased classifier [25] with 90 epochs of linear probing, where detailed configurations are mostly obtained from common practices [32, 73, 74]. Images are resized to 224224 and the global batch size is 8,192 across 8 A100 (80G) GPUs. (2) For semantic segmentation, we adopt ViT-Adapter [12] with UperNet [82] as the segmentation decoder. The implementation is based on MMSegmentation [17] with 80k training iterations. The input resolution is 512512 and the global batch size is 16 across 8 A100 (80G) GPUs. (3) For attribute, relation and, ordering, we regard the negative of the caption loss over each image-text pair as the similarity metric for retrieval. 4.2. Experimental Results 4.2.1. Results on Vision Language Tasks As shown in Table 2, we compare SAIL against existing MLLMs across 13 vision-language benchmarks. SAIL consistently outperforms other Single Transformer-based models like Fuyu [5], EVE [21], SOLO [11], MonoInternVL [54], and EVE2 [22] across diverse visionlanguage tasks. This demonstrates that SAIL can achieve significant performance gains and push the boundaries of Single Transformer-based MLLMs without needing extra component designs or auxiliary training losses. Moreover, when compared to methods employing discrete vision tokens (e.g., Chameleon and Emu3), SAIL demonstrates superior performance. These results validate that scaling up single-transformer pretraining effectively enhances crossmodal alignment between images and text. Compared to the state-of-the-art modular MLLM LLaVA-OneVision [41], SAIL achieves comparable performance on some benchmarks, such as MMStar, SEEDBench-IMG, and RealWorldQA. While the performance of Single Transformerbased MLLMs still lags behind modular MLLMs in certain areas, we hypothesize that scaling the pretraining data volume or incorporating higher-quality instruction-tuning data will bridge the remaining performance gap. 4.2.2. Results on Vision Representation Learning In this section, we compare the quality of learned visual representations of our SAIL with other Single Transformerbased alternatives, including EVE [21], EVE2 [22], and SOLO [11]. Classification and Segmentation. As demonstrated in Table 3, our method, SAIL, achieves Top-1 accuracy of 84.95% and Top-5 accuracy of 97.59% on the validation set of ImageNet-1K [20], significantly outperforming stateof-the-art alternatives [11, 21, 22]. In the segmentation task, SAIL also demonstrates superior performance with an mIoU of 55.30%, an mAcc of 67.24%, and an aAcc of 84.87%, illustrated in Table 3. These results indicate that SAIL is effective in both classification and segmentation tasks, of5 Method #Param #Data #Vtoken General VQA Hallucination Math&knowledge OCR VQA MMS* MMBen SEEDI MMV MME RWQA POPE Hallu SQAI MathV TQA AI2D OCRB Modular MLLMs: InternVL-1.5 [13] QwenVL-Chat [3] LLaVA-1.5 [47] LLaVA-1.6 [48] Cambrian-1 [69] LLaVA-OneVision [41] 2.2B 7B 7B 7B 8B 7B 3328 / 7.2B / 50M 256 0.4B+ / 665K 576 0.4B+ / 760K 2880 10B+ / 7M 576 10B+ / 3.2M 7290 Single Transformer-based MLLMs: Fuyu [5] Chameleon [67] EVE [21] SOLO [11] Mono-InternVL [54] Emu3 [79] EVE2 [22] SAIL 8B 7B 7B 8B 3B 8B 7B 7B / 1.4B+ / 1.8M 1024 33M / 1.8M 2304 43.7M / 2M 1024 6400 1.3B / 7M 16K / 92M / 7.3M 2500 600M / 6M 46.7 34.5 33.1 37.6 50.7 60.9 34.4 31.1 35.8 46.6 53.1 70.9 60.6 64.3 67.4 75.9 81.7 10.7 31.1 52.3 67.7 65.5 58.5 66.3 70.1 69.8 58.2 64.3 64.7 74.7 74.8 59.3 30.6 64.6 64.4 67.4 68.2 71.4 72. 39.3 1902 1848 30.5 1859 43.9 1842 58.8 1998 21.4 8.3 170 25.7 1628 30.4 1260 40.1 1875 37.2 45.0 1709 46.3 57.9 49.3 54.8 57.8 64.2 65.5 43.7 39 44.7 57.4 62.4 63.9 88.3 85.9 86.4 84 19.4 85.0 78.6 85.2 87.6 85.8 37.3 36.8 27.6 27.6 30.6 29.8 17.1 40.4 45.7 31.7 54.2 84.9 68.2 66.8 70.2 80.4 96.6 56.8 47.2 64.9 73.3 93.6 89.2 96.2 93.3 41.3 35.3 25.5 32.5 48.1 56.1 30.2 22.5 32.9 45.7 31.3 57.0 70.5 69.8 61.5 45.9 46.1 54.8 64.9 66.6 71.7 73.0 81. 46.8 4.8 46.0 56.8 61.0 25.0 61.4 72.6 68.6 64.7 70.0 71.1 74.8 77.1 76.7 654 488 318 532 366 7.0 398 126 767 687 702 783 Table 2.

Model Scaling: We selected models of different sizes: SAIL-0.5B, SAIL-3B, and SAIL-7B (SAIL by default) for our experiments. Each model underwent Stage 1 pretraining on mixed multimodal and pure text dataset, encountering 512M image-text pairs. Subsequently, they were fine6 Figure 3. Model scaling of SAIL. Left: As the model size increases, the training language modeling loss gradually decreases. Right: As the model size increases, performance on downstream VLM tasks progressively improves. tuned on the LLaVA-mix-665K dataset using the any resolution (anyres) strategy. We evaluated the models based on their performance on vision and language benchmarks after supervised fine-tuning. The normalized performance of SAIL against model size is plotted in Figure 3. As the model size scales up, we observe corresponding enhancement in performance. Additionally, as shown on the left side of Figure 3, the training language modeling loss decreases with increasing model size. This reduction in training loss indicates that larger models have greater capacity to learn multimodal alignments effectively, enabling them to capture complex relationships between vision and language more accurately. The improved learning capacity directly translates to better performance on downstream VLM tasks, showcasing the benefits of scaling up the Single Transformer architecture. Data Scaling: we compared SAIL with its modular MLLM counterpart. For the modular MLLM, we used SigLIPSO [87] as the vision encoder, and the language model shared the same architecture and initialization parameters as SAIL. Both models were pre-trained using Pretraining stage-1 setting, with SAIL encountering 32M, 128M, and 512M image-text pairs during training, followed by finetuning on the LLaVA-mix-665K dataset. All parameters of both models are trainable. Both models employ an identical number of input tokens for images and text. The normalized performance of both models is plotted in Figure 1(A). The results show that in the low-data regime (32M), SAILs performance lags behind the modular MLLM, likely due to SigLIPs prior training on 40B samples. However, as the data scales, SAIL exhibits steeper performance curve, indicating more promising data scaling properties. At 512M image-text pairs, SAIL achieves performance comparable to the modular MLLM in our evaluation subset. This demonstrates the single transformers superior data scalability, even without pretrained vision encoder. Quantitative results on evaluated benchmark tasks of model scaling and data scaling are tabulated in the appendix. Figure 4. Image Attention Score Allocation: The figure shows the proportion of image attention scores across different transformer layers for Single Transformer-based MLLM and modular MLLM when predicting tokens. Single Transformer-based MLLM generally allocates higher attention weights to image tokens compared to modular MLLM. 4.3.2. Information Flow Pattern Different attention pattern compared to modular MLLM: since our comparative experiments show that the Single Transformer model exhibits more promising data scaling properties, we conducted an analysis of the trained SAIL model and its modular MLLM counterpart. Specifically, we followed the methodology from FastV [10] to analyze the attention score distribution for each predicted token given an image and user query. This analysis focuses on how much attention is allocated to image tokens during token prediction. We selected 1000 samples from various datasets including VQAv2, GQA, TextVQA, DocVQA, MME, SEEDBench-IMG, MMBench, and some self-curated dialog examples. For each model prediction, we computed the average attention scores assigned to previous image tokens by the output token. We conducted comparative experiment between Single Transformer-based MLLMs and modular MLLMs. The Single Transformer-based MLLMs included SAIL, SOLO [11], and EVE [21], while the modular MLLMs included Qwen2-VL [77], LLaVA-OneVision [41], and LLaVA1.5 [47]. The results are depicted in Figure 4. Single Transformerbased MLLMs allocate between 60% and 80% of attention scores to image tokens across all layers when predicting tokens. In contrast, modular MLLMs such as Qwen2-VL and LLaVA-OneVision allocate only 10% to 30% of attention scores to image tokens across different layers. For LLaVA1.5, which does not update the ViT parameters during supervised fine-tuning (SFT), the image attention score is relatively high in the first two transformer layers but declines sharply in subsequent layers.

The default setting includes image full attention and the inclusion of pure text data in pretraining. Ablation #1 removes image full attention, and ablation #2 excludes pure text in pretraining. From this experiment, we can conclude that Single Transformer-based MLLMs tend to allocate significant portion of attention to previous image tokens during prediction. In contrast, modular MLLMs allocate smaller portion of their attention directly to image tokens, indicating less image-centric approach in their prediction mechanism."

            "content": "the Single Transformer model places more emphasis on grounding its predictions in the visual information. As the model undergoes data scaling, it allocates more effective computation to image tokens, thereby enhancing its capability as vision-centric model. In summary, the attention pattern analysis underscores the Single Transformers ability to robustly integrate visual context, enabling it to scale efficiently and potentially outperform modular MLLMs in vision-language tasks. 4.3.3. Task-Specific Performance Analysis We dissect SAIL strengths and limitations through targeted case studies: Strengths: Spatial Reasoning. SAIL excels at tasks requiring precise spatial location. As shown in Table 6, under the setting of our data scaling experiment, it outperforms the modular counterpart by 61.7 points on the MME Position split and 21.8% on MMBench Physical Relation questions. The unified architecture likely enables tighter coupling between visual geometry and linguistic descriptions. Weaknesses: World Knowledge. Conversely, SAIL falls short in tasks that demand extensive world knowledge. As shown in Table 6 SAIL underperforms in the MME celebrity and art splits compared to the modular MLLM. This underperformance can be attributed to SAILs lack of diverse domain-specific data during pretraining, gap that was not sufficiently addressed during supervised fine-tuning. Modular MLLMs, with their pretrained vision encoders like CLIP [15, 62] or SigLIP [87], have broader knowledge base and therefore handle such tasks more effectively. We hypothesize that scaling up SAIL pretraining data diversity could help bridge this gap, enhancing its performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. 4.4. Empirical Observations on Basic Factors To guide scalable training of single-transformer MLLMs, we conduct ablation studies on two critical design choices using SAIL-0.5B pretrained on 128M image-text pairs and fine-tuned on LLaVA-mix-665K. Performance is evaluated through zero-shot image classification after pretraining [71] and vision-language benchmarks after SFT. Bidirectional Attention for Image Patches with Multimodal Position Encoding. We compare two approaches for integrating image patches into the transformer: (1) Causal attention with 1D positional encoding, using <vision sep> token to demarcate image rows. (2) Full bidirectional attention for image patches paired with multimodal rotary position embeddings (RoPE), which jointly encode spatial coordinates (e.g., 2D grid positions) and text token positions. As shown in Table 7, configuration of using bidirectional attention with multimodal RoPE significantly improves performance on vision-language tasks, with particularly notable gain of 3.1% on TextVQA. This suggests that enabling cross-patch interactions during pretraining enhances visual representation learning and tightens crossmodal alignment. Interleaving Pure Text Data During Pretraining. We analyze the impact of mixing SlimPajama text data with image-text pairs during pretraining. The results, as presented in Table 7 #2, reveal that mixing in pure text data consistently improves performance across vision and language benchmarks. This finding underscores the importance of preserving language capabilities in the LLM when training Single Transformer models, as maintaining strong language skills is crucial for building multimodal model capable of complex reasoning. Currently, incorporating text data in training is one of the effective methods to maintain the language abilities of the model. In conclusion, our ablation studies identify key design choices for training SAIL effectively. Using bi-directional attention with multimodal rotary position embeddings enhances visual perception, while incorporating pure text data preserves essential language capabilities for robust multimodal performance. 8 5. Conclusion In this work, we conducted an extensive analysis of Single Transformer-based MLLMs compared to modular MLLMs. Our investigation explored the unique properties of Single Transformers, including scalability, cross-modal information flow patterns, and visual representation capabilities. series of experiments on our trained SAIL model demonstrated that this unified architecture achieves performance on vision-language benchmarks comparable to modular MLLMs while also functioning effectively as vision backbone. Our findings highlight several advantages of Single Transformer architectures, such as superior data scalability, vision-centric information flow, and inherent capabilities as powerful vision encoder. We hope our empirical findings will inspire further research to refine and enhance Single Transformer architectures, advancing the field of multimodal intelligence."

            "title": "Additional Experimental Results",
            "content": "A comparison of SAIL and LLaVA1.5. In this section, we conduct an experiment to compare SAIL with LLaVA1.5 [47]. In this experiment, our SAIL is trained on 512M image-text pairs in Pretraining Stage 1, followed by fine-tuning on the LLaVA-mix-665K dataset. To fairly compare the performance of the two models, we do not use the anyres strategy during SFT. Instead, we adopt the same image processing approach as LLaVA1.5, ensuring that the aspect ratio and number of image tokens are consistent across both models. The experimental results are presented in Table 10. Despite our model being trained on only 512M image-text pairs, which is significantly smaller than the CLIP pretraining data used in the LLaVA1.5 model, the results show that our model achieves comparable performance to LLaVA1.5 across various benchmarks. Remarkably, our model even outperforms LLaVA1.5 on specific benchmarks such as DocVQA and ChartVQA. These findings highlight the strong potential of Single Transformer models in terms of data scaling. Specifically, they suggest that even with relatively smaller pretraining dataset, Single Transformer models can perform on par with, or even exceed, more extensively trained modular MLLMs like LLaVA1.5 when similar preprocessing and controlled variables are applied. Compare SAIL and LLaVA on MMVP. We compare SAIL and LLaVA1.5 [47] on MMVP [70] to dissect the behavior of the two models. The results are shown in Figure 5. From examples (A) and (B), we observe that SAIL performs better in perceiving minor regions and objects. Examples (C) and (D) illustrate that SAIL can more accurately distinguish the states of objects. Additional Experiments on Information Flow Pattern Analysis. In the main paper, we analyzed the distribution patterns of image attention scores for different Single Transformer-based MLLMs and modular MLLMs. The results showed that Single Transformer-based MLLMs allocate more attention weights to image tokens. However, this could be due to different models processing varying numbers of image tokens, where more image tokens lead to higher aggregated attention scores. To analyze this in more controlled manner, we designed an additional experiment. Using the data scaling setup at 512M, we pretrained SAIL and its modular MLLM counterpart. After pretraining, we fine-tuned both models using the LLaVA-mix-665K dataset, fixing the resolution size to 224x224 during SFT, instead of using any resolution. The results, shown in Figure 6, reveal that SAIL allocates higher attention scores to image tokens across all transformer layers compared to the modular MLLM, particularly in medium layers (+43.5% in layer 14) and deep layers (+41.2% in layer 31). From this, we can conclude that Single Transformerbased MLLMs tend to allocate significant portion of attention to previous image tokens during prediction. In contrast, modular MLLMs allocate smaller portion of their attention directly to image tokens, indicating less imagecentric approach in their prediction mechanism. Attention Map Visualization. In the main paper, we found that Single Transformer-based MLLMs allocate large portion of attention weights to image tokens during inference, indicating more vision-centric model. Here, we visualize the attention distribution of SAIL across different regions of the image when predicting tokens.

The visualizations show that in the early transformer layers, the predicted tokens primarily focus on the salient regions of the image. As the model progresses to deeper layers, the attention shifts to areas more relevant to the predicted tokens. This behavior demonstrates that SAIL has the potential to function as grounding model, effectively correlating text tokens with their corresponding image regions. In other words, during inference, the model incrementally concentrates attention weights on relevant regions, aiding in decision-making. This progressive focusing of attention signifies the models capability to ground text tokens in the corresponding visual context, enhancing its performance in vision-language tasks. Visual Understanding Demonstration. We investigate several vision perception and reasoning capabilities of our SAIL. These include its ability to understand rich OCR information  (Table 11)  , interpret real-world scenes  (Table 12)  , comprehend scientific charts  (Table 13)  , and analyze poster contents  (Table 14)  . 10 Figure 5.

SAIL There are several notable elements in the image: 1. The highway is multi-lane, with multiple lanes visible. 2. The traffic is dense, with vehicles in various lanes. 3. The weather seems to be overcast, as indicated by the grayish tones of the image. 4. There are several traffic signs and signs visible, including green highway sign indicating 1/2 mile to the right, and green sign with the number 16 and the word MILE on the left side of the image. 5. The background includes hill or mountain, with trees and greenery visible. 6. There are also several power lines and electrical pylons visible along the sides of the highway. The images focus is on the traffic and the surrounding environment. The vehicles are primarily in the center and right lanes of the highway, with some vehicles in the left lanes as well. The highway is flanked by lush greenery, including trees and grassy areas, suggesting that this is rural or possibly suburban area. The traffic appears to be moving at moderate pace. The weather conditions suggest that this is daytime scene, possibly during the morning or late afternoon. The image is taken from perspective that suggests the viewer is in vehicle on the highway, observing the traffic ahead. In summary, the image captures typical highway scene with moderate traffic, surrounded by mix of natural and built environments, under an overcast sky. The road is in good condition, and the vehicles are traveling smoothly in both directions. Table 12. SAIL demonstrates strong capability about understanding the real-world scene.

SAIL At the top of the image, there is decorative border with pattern of hanging golden ornaments, which adds festive and celebratory feel to the overall design. The background is plain white, which helps the colorful elements stand out. In the center of the image, the text Happy Sankranti is prominently displayed in large, elegant, and stylized font. The text is in warm orange color, which is traditionally associated with the festival. Below the text, there is depiction of woman dressed in traditional Indian attire, likely saree, in shades of blue and green. She is engaged in the act of preparing traditional Sankranti sweet, which is common practice during the festival. The sweet is shaped like pyramid and is decorated with intricate patterns, reflecting the artistic and cultural heritage of the region. To the left of the woman, there is three-tiered pot, known as patala, which is traditional Indian cooking vessel. The pot is adorned with colorful design and is placed on colorful circular mat, which is also traditional element in Indian households. On the right side of the woman, there is small hut with thatched roof, which is common architectural style in rural Indian villages. The hut is depicted in simple and rustic manner, emphasizing the rural and traditional aspect of the scene. Overall, the image captures the essence of the Sankranti festival, highlighting the cultural and religious aspects of the celebration. The use of traditional clothing, the preparation of traditional sweets, and the depiction of rural village scene all contribute to sense of cultural authenticity and celebration. Table 14.
