            "content": "Xuanyang Zhang is the project lead; Corresponding Authors. ArXiv Preprint, 2025, Cailin Zhuang, Yaoqi Hu, Xuanyang Zhang, Wei Cheng et al. domains demand not only geometric precision but also artistic expressiveness, where naive extensions of 3D GS often fail due to inadequate style-texture alignment, semantic incoherence, and limited adaptability to abstract aesthetics. While recent works explore 3D GS stylization via 2D priors (e.g., VGG [60] for texture transfer [12, 40, 84], CLIP [54] for semantic guidance [34]), their reliance on simplistic feature extraction and trial-and-error optimization leads to fragmented stylization, over-smoothed details, and inconsistent results across objects and scenes. To address these challenges, we present StyleMe3D, holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that systematically integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our work is grounded in three critical insights: Geometric preservation: optimizing only the RGB attributes of 3D Gaussians preserves structural integrity while enabling stylization, avoiding the instability of geometry-altering methods. Semantic-aware stylization: effective style transfer requires disentangling and aligning features at low-, medium-, and high-semantic levels, which existing single-prior approaches (e.g., VGG or CLIP alone) cannot achieve. Scalability: robust solution must generalize across isolated 3D objects (e.g., virtual assets) and complex scenes (e.g., openworld environments), capability absent in prior art. Furtehr, StyleMe3D introduces four key components to address these stylization challenges following the above insights, namely Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS),Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA). Leveraging Stable Diffusion (SD) [55] as semantic prior, DSSD dynamically aligns style patterns from text prompts or reference images with 3D content through gradientbased score matching. To our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit SDs latent space for 3D GS style transfer, overcoming the limitations of VGG/CLIP in capturing nuanced artistic semantics. Existing methods often homogenize style application due to overdependence on low-level features (VGG) or global semantics (CLIP). CSD introduces contrastively trained encoder that extracts medium-level style descriptors from curated style dataset, enabling localized, content-aware stylization (e.g., applying distinct textures to buildings vs. vegetation in scene). We propose multiscale optimization to decouple style-texture details (via VGGs shallow layers) and structural coherence (via deeper layers), preserving high-frequency artistic patterns without distorting geometry. Inspired by conventional image quality assessment (IQA) metrics (e.g., CLIP-IQA [69]), 3DG-QA serves as an aesthetic prior explicitly designed for 3D GS optimization. Trained on human-rated stylized 3D scenes, 3DG-QA encodes holistic aesthetic criteriacomposition harmony, texture sharpness, depth-aware color consistencyinto differentiable loss. During optimization, 3DG-QA guides the model to suppress artifacts (e.g., over-saturation in occluded regions) while enhancing artistic appeal, acting as \"virtual art director\" for 3D style transfer. We validate StyleMe3D on 3D object dataset NeRF synthetic dataset [47] and 3D scene dataset tandt db [29], demonstrating its universality across geometric complexities and artistic styles. StyleMe3D achieves superior stylization fieldlity compared with several state-of-the-art methods StyleGaussian [40], ARF [85] and SGSST [15]. For objects, our framework preserves fine details (e.g., intricate carvings on sculptures) while transferring styles with high fieldlity precision. For scenes, it ensures holistic stylistic consistencymaintaining coherent lighting and color palettes across various settingswithout sacrificing real-time rendering capabilities. We summary our contributions as follows: systematic framework for 3D GS style transfer, resolving geometric preservation, multi-modal style conditioning, and multi-level feature alignment. First integration of Stable Diffusion into 3D GS optimization, enabling semantically coherent stylization beyond VGG/CLIP priors. Novel technical components (DSSD, CSD, SOS and 3DG-QA) that collectively address style localization, detail preservation, and aesthetic quality. By bridging photorealistic 3D reconstruction and artistic stylization, StyleMe3D unlocks new possibilities for immersive, stylized environments while preserving the core advantages of 3D GS: precision, scalability, and real-time performance."

            "content": "2D generation has rapidly advanced across generative modeling, customization, conditional control, editing, and stylization. Initial breakthroughs in 2D synthesis with VAEs and GANs [2, 20, 28] were furthered by diffusion models [35, 55, 78, 83], enhancing image quality and diversity for complex manipulation. For efficiency, frequency-based fine-tuning and wavelet VAEs have enabled lightweight models [18, 57]. Personalized generation has also progressed, focusing on customized images [27, 83], video [3, 26], and motion [33]. Text-driven editing now offers extensive control frameworks [1, 11, 23, 32, 45, 56, 62], with character consistency essential for coherent multi-image outputs [21, 38, 71, 82, 89]. Stylization advances emphasize style-content separation, with cross-attention-based transfer [10, 67, 82] and shared attention mechanisms for coherence [77]. Frequency-domain techniques aid diffusion control [17], while Aligning style with textual cues [37], cross-domain fusion [52] and FFT-based transfer [22] expand style applications. In this paper, we aim to style 3D GS and these 2D methods give us lot of insights and priors that can be reused in the 3D field. 2.2 3D Generation Native 3D generation has progressed significantly with core representations such as meshes [5, 75, 79] and point clouds [50, 59, 81]. Meshes enable continuous surface modeling, while point clouds allow flexible spatial detail. This field now includes singleview 3D generation [42, 43] for full reconstructions from minimal input and multi-view methods [4, 41, 58, 63, 70] that ensure crossview consistency. Texture synthesis, particularly with advanced UV mapping [7, 30, 44], enhances realism and surface detail in 3D models. StyleMe3D: Stylization with Disentangled Priors by Multiple Encoders on 3D Gaussians ArXiv Preprint, 2025, Figure 2: Overview of our 3D stylization framework (StyleMe3D): (a) Style Purification: Extracts and refines style representations via Style Cleaning in CLIP space, removing content interference from reference images. (b) Multi-Expert Stylization: The Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD) module employs dynamic noise scheduling and adaptive style guidance, integrating latent losses to achieve consistent stylization step by step. Integrates three specialized components within the Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD) framework: Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS): Adaptive noise scheduling for texture preservation. Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD): Separates style and content via contrastive learning for style similarity score. CLIP-IQA: Quality-guided refinement using antonymic semantic prompts. (c) Progressive Consistency Optimization (Style Outpainting): Progressive outpainting achieves multi-view style propagation. Ensures coherent through iterative latent alignment, eliminating multi-view dependencies. Text-guided 3D generation has also advanced with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) [53] and its variants [66, 73], enabling controllable, diverse 3D synthesis. These techniques support artistic scene generation [36] and multimodal inputs (text and image) [63, 64, 74, 80]. Recent improvements in latent diffusion models further enhance the expressiveness and creative potential of text-to-3D generation [80, 88], and more and more multi-view [6, 8, 51] and 3D dataset [13, 76] still stimulate the development of this field. While 3D generation is not our core task in this work and we define the 3D GS stylization as post-training task which further boradcasts 3D GS to more various applications. 2.3 3D Style Transfer For 3D stylization, methods like [25, 48] embed styles directly into 3D structures, while radiance field-based methods [49, 65, 85] achieve style transfer through optimization for enhanced scene realism. Though HyperNet [9] enables arbitrary style embedding in MLPs, it suffers from slow rendering and detail loss, while StyleRF [39] offers zero-shot stylization by transforming radiance field features but lacks adaptability and control. Recent advances in 3D stylization have explored various techniques to embed artistic styles into 3D content, with reference-based methods like [46, 87] for controlled stylization and arbitrary reference techniques [40, 84] for flexible style transfer. Scalable 3D style transfer brings the 3d stylized resolution up to 4K by SOS Loss [15]. Stylized Score Distillation [31] and 3D-aware diffusion models [74] further expand these capabilities. Different from previous works, we systematically analyzed the 3D GS stylization task, proposed more comprehensive approach to allivate the core challenges within this task and achieved superior performance."

In the style transfer task, we aim to only change the 3D gaussian stylization rather than the geometry content. We achieve geometrystyle decoupling in 3D gaussian by leveraging the inherent separation of geometric and color parameters in its parametric representation. Specifically, our style transfer framework exclusively optimizes the color parameters Θ𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 while maintaining frozen geometric attributes during the stylization process as: min Θ𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑣=1 (R (C𝑣; Θ); 𝜙, 𝑅) (3) where 𝑛view represents the total number of rendering views and 𝑛opt denotes the required optimizations per view, managed iteratively by 𝑖step. Local Guidance. Local guidance focuses on single-view optimization, maximizing stylization quality for individual views, albeit at the potential expense of global consistency. The local guidance schedule is defined as: 𝛼step = 𝑖step mod 𝑛opt 𝑛opt (5) The effectiveness of these modes in balancing stylization strength and consistency is discussed in Sec. 4.3. To maximize the stylization outcome, we combine both guidance modes for complementary strengths. Fine Timestep Sampling. Fine timestep sampling enhances temporal resolution by focusing on low-noise intervals for more granular optimization, with noise progressively decreasing from high to low levels. This sampling strategy is formulated as: 𝑡 = 𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ((1 𝛼 0.5 step) T).clip(𝑇min,𝑇max) (6) We further discuss how to instantiate the L, 𝜙 and 𝑅 with different formulations and jointly improve the stylization effectiveness in the following sections. where denotes the total timesteps, with 𝑇min and 𝑇max setting the bounds.

            "title": "3.2 Dynamic Style Score Distillation",
            "content": "In this section, we distill the prior from the 2D stable diffusion model [55] and use both text and image prompt for style transfer. Style Cleaning. Inspired by InstantStyle [67], we use pre-trained CLIP model for Style Cleaning to isolate pure style information. In CLIP space, we filter out style-irrelevant details by subtracting content descriptors from style embeddings. Specifically, descriptions of the style reference image are generated using captioning model (e.g., GPT-4V) to distinguish content-related descriptors. The CLIP Text Encoder extracts Content Text Embedding (or both content and style) from these descriptors, while the CLIP Image Encoder produces Style Image Embedding. Subtracting Content Text Embedding from Style Image Embedding (and adding Style Text Embedding) yields Final Style Embedding containing only style-related information. The style clean process is shown in Fig. 2. Progressive Style Outpainting (PSO). PSO is novel style guidance method for consistent and detailed style propagation in multiview 3D stylization (see Fig. 2). Using 2D style priors provided by an image stylization diffusion model [16], we redefine multi-view guidance as progressive outpainting task. By integrating sparseview RGB loss with dense-view SDS loss, PSO ensures consistent 3D stylization across views. Instead of random view selection, our method incrementally propagates style information to adjacent views, enhancing style coherence with each step. Specifically, PSO consists of two primary guidance modes, namely gobal guidance and local guidance. Global Guidance. In the global gudance stage, uniform noise level is applied to all views before stepwise reduction, defined as: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD). As shown in Fig. 2(b). DSSD further extends score distillation by applying dynamic CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) [24] scale coefficient to optimize the intensity of style guidance. Fixed CFG values can lead to oversmoothing (low CFG) or oversaturation (high CFG). To counter this, we introduce dynamic guidance coefficient that adaptively balances fixed CFG values throughout optimization. The adaptive coefficient is defined as: Δ𝜆 = max (cid:16)7.5, 𝜆max (cid:16) 𝛼 2 step (cid:17)(cid:17) (7) With this method, we extend the SSD proposed by [31], and define the style loss in latent space as: DSSD𝑧 2D = (1 Δ𝜆𝑠 )𝜖𝜙2D (𝑧𝑡𝑠 𝑦, 𝑡𝑠 ) + Δ𝜆𝑠 ˆ𝜖𝜙2D (𝑧𝑡𝑠 𝑦, 𝑠, 𝑡𝑠 ) 𝜖𝑠, (8) where 𝜖𝜙2𝐷 () is the predicted noise by the style-based 2D diffusion prior 𝜙. The latent space loss aligns abstract style features, whereas pixelspace loss emphasizes visible characteristics. For stylizing given 3D model, latent loss ensures style feature transfer, while pixel loss provides further reliability in visual output. Defining 𝑥𝑡𝑠 = Decoder(𝑧𝑡𝑠 ), the pixel-space loss is given by: DSSD𝑥 2D = (1 Δ𝜆𝑠 )𝜖𝜙2D (𝑥𝑡𝑠 𝑦, 𝑡𝑠 ) + Δ𝜆𝑠 ˆ𝜖𝜙2D (𝑥𝑡𝑠 𝑦, 𝑠, 𝑡𝑠 ) 𝜖𝑠 (9) Our Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD) objective function integrates latent DSSD and pixel DSSD: Θ𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 LDSSD (𝑥 = (C𝑣; Θ𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 ); 𝜙, 𝑅) = E𝑡𝑧 𝑠 ,𝑡 𝑥 𝑠 ,𝜖𝑧 𝑠 ,𝜖𝑥 𝑠 (cid:34) 𝜔 (𝑡) (cid:16) 2DDSSD𝑧 𝜆𝑧 2D + 𝜆𝑥 2DDSSD𝑥 2D (cid:35) (cid:17) 𝑥 𝜃 (10) 𝛼step = (cid:16) (cid:106) 𝑖step 𝑛view (cid:17) (cid:107) mod 𝑛opt 𝑛opt (4) where 𝜔 (𝑡) is weighting function regulating timestep contributions.

If required, additional loss terms such as SSIM loss [72] or LPIPS loss [86] may be integrated to enhance alignment. Thus, our final objective function is: Lstyle = 𝜆DSSDLDSSD + 𝜆RGBLRGB + 𝜆maskLmask (11) This setup ensures multi-view consistency in 3D stylization, achieving refined style expression and geometric fidelity through the dynamic coefficient adjustment and adaptive optimization strategy."

LPIPS assesses perceptual StyleMe3D: Stylization with Disentangled Priors by Multiple Encoders on 3D Gaussians ArXiv Preprint, 2025, Figure 4: Qualitative Comparisons on Object Level Stylization. We compare our method against other SOTA (SGSST [15], StyleGaussian [40] and ARF [85]) on nerf synthetic dataset (selected chair, hotdog, and mic) using vangogh wheat field, fire nezha, and sketch styles. The horizontal axis represents the compared methods, and the vertical axis displays different data. Our method effectively retains semantic and details of original model and style feature of reference image, such as semantic separation of the legs of the chair from the seat cushion, texture of the fire on the hot dog, and metallic sheen on the mic. Compared to others, our method exhibits stronger semantic understanding, clearly distinguishing elements like the cushions, backrest and legs on the chair. Figure 5: Qualitative Comparisons on Scene Level Stylization. We compare our method against other SOTA (SGSST [15], StyleGaussian [40] and ARF [85]) on tandt db dataset (selected truck and train) using landscope and lighting tiger styles. The horizontal axis represents the compared methods, and the vertical axis displays different data. Our method effectively retains semantic and details of original model and style feature of reference image, such as the truck wheel and train fence (as shown in Zoom-in). Compared to others, our method exhibits stronger semantic understanding, clearly distinguishing elements like the fence, tire and rail.

(a) Baseline without style outpainting exhibits limited stylization scope and view-dependent artifacts (red boxes). (b) Local Guidance enables single-view enhancement but causes multiview inconsistencies. Global-Local Fusion achieves crossview style propagation through adaptive attention weighting, improving style consistency while preserving view-specific details. Figure 8: Ablation study loss design. (a) DSSD-only initialization yields semantically coherent but texture-deficient results with color shifts (see missing curvilinear patterns in Van Gogh stylization). (b) DSSD+SOS achieves texturegeometry equilibrium through gradient mutual regularization, recovering fine details while suppressing oversmoothing. (c) Full Model (DSSD+SOS+CSD+CLIP-IQA) enhances perceptual quality via knowledge-driven style assessment, achieving remarkable improvement over baseline  (Table 2)  . Figure 7: Ablation study on dynamic noise scheduling. Low Scale (7.5) produces incomplete stylization with missing texture details. High Scale (50) introduces oversaturation artifacts and structural distortions. Dynamic Scale (7.5-30) adaptively balances detail preservation and style intensity. quality based on deep network features, emphasizing visual similarity as perceived by humans. As shown in Tab. 1, our method achieves significantly higher SSIM and PSNR scores, demonstrating enhanced structural and perceptual fidelity compared to SGSST, StyleGaussian and ARF. Our higher PSNR and SSIM score indicates better fidelity in color and texture reproduction while preserving structural details. Furthermore, the LPIPS score, measuring perceptual similarity, supports our methods superior style consistency and stylization quality across multiple viewpoints.

            "content": "We conducted ablation studies to assess the impact of various components and parameters in our method, focusing on style outpainting mode, DDSD and multi-expert module. Ablation on Style Outpainting. As shown in Fig. 6. We present an ablation study on the impact of Style Outpainting. Without it, the degree of stylization is visibly limited, whereas applying Style Outpainting allows effective style propagation across views. We compares different guidance schemes: local mode & global-local mode. Local mode shows inconsistencies, resulting in artifacts and missing details in certain views. In contrast, global-local mode enhances stylization intensity and detail refinement, achieving more coherent stylization across views. Ablation on DSSD. As shown in Fig. 7. We conducted an ablation study on the effectiveness of dynamic guidance scale in DSSD. Comparing results at low scale of 7.5, high scale of 50, and dynamic scale ranging from 7.5 to 30, we observed that the dynamic scale approach consistently outperforms static setting. Ablation on Multi-Expert. As shown in Fig. 8, we analyze the impact of SOS, CSD and 3DG-QA on stylization quality. our analysis reveals that initial stylization using DSSD alone produces semantically coherent results but suffers from two critical limitations: 1) Insufficient low-level texture details (e.g., missing curvilinear patterns in Van Gogh-inspired wheat field renderings), and 2) Systematic color deviation artifacts. The introduction of SOS loss establishes dual-optimization framework where DSSD and SOS operate concurrently within single-view projections. This configuration enables mutual regularization of their gradient optimization directions - DSSDs tendency toward over-smoothing is counterbalanced by SOSs capacity for detail enhancement, while SOSs potential overemphasis on low-level features is constrained by DSSDs semantic guidance. Subsequent integration of CSD and 3DG-QA implements knowledgedriven perceptual assessment through CLIP-space cosine similarity StyleMe3D: Stylization with Disentangled Priors by Multiple Encoders on 3D Gaussians ArXiv Preprint, 2025, metrics. The CSD module specializes in style authenticity evaluation through learned artistic aesthetics criteria, while 3DG-QA provides quality-focused guidance via antonymic text prompts. Quantitative analysis shows this combined approach achieves remarkable improvement in human perceptual quality scores compared to baseline configurations (see Table 2)."

            "content": "A Preliminary A.1 Style-aware Image Customization In recent advancements in style transfer, StyleShot [16] and IP-Adapter [82] represent two prominent techniques, each employing distinct methods to transfer style from reference image to target image. StyleShot emphasizes the extraction of detailed style features using style-aware encoder, which leverages multiscale patch partitioning to capture both low-level and high-level style cues. Specifically, StyleShot divides the reference image into non-overlapping patches of three sizes, corresponding to different scales. For each patch scale, there is dedicated ResBlock at different depths. The following are the key formulas for style injection in StyleShot: Attention(𝑄, 𝐾𝑠, 𝑉𝑠 ) = softmax (cid:19) (cid:18) 𝑄𝐾𝑇 𝑠 𝑑 𝑉𝑠 (S1) where 𝑄 is the query projected from the latent embeddings 𝑓 , and 𝐾𝑠 and 𝑉𝑠 are the keys and values, respectively, that the style embeddings 𝑓𝑠 are projected onto through independent mapping functions . The attention outputs of the text embeddings 𝑓𝑡 and 𝑊𝐾𝑠 style embeddings 𝑓𝑠 are then combined into new latent embeddings 𝑓 , which are fed into subsequent blocks of Stable Diffusion: and 𝑊𝑉𝑠 𝑓 = Attention(𝑄, 𝐾𝑡 , 𝑉𝑡 ) + 𝜆 Attention(𝑄, 𝐾𝑠, 𝑉𝑠 ) (S2) where 𝜆 represents the weight balancing the two components.

            "content": "Text-guided 3D generation has gained significant attention due to advancements in methods such as Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) [53], which facilitates the optimization of 3D representations using pre-trained diffusion models. SDS optimizes the parameters 𝜃 of 3D model 𝑔(𝜃 ) by distilling gradients from diffusion model 𝜙, ensuring that 2D projections generated from 𝑔(𝜃 ) align with target text prompt. The gradient of the SDS loss is defined as: (cid:20) 𝜔 (𝑡) 𝜃 𝐿SDS (𝜙, 𝑥 = 𝑔(𝜃 )) = E𝑡,𝜖 (cid:16) ˆ𝜖𝜙 (𝑧𝑡 ; 𝑦, 𝑡) 𝜖 (S3) (cid:21) , (cid:17) 𝑥 𝜃 where ˆ𝜖𝜙 (𝑧𝑡 ; 𝑦, 𝑡) represents the predicted noise residual from the pre-trained diffusion model, 𝜖 is the actual noise used in the forward process, 𝑧𝑡 is the latent variable at timestep 𝑡, and 𝜔 (𝑡) is timestep weighting function. These have been extended to artistic scene generation [36] and combined input conditions, including text and images [74, 80]. Recent advances leveraging latent diffusion models have improved the scope and expressiveness of text-to-3D synthesis [80, 88], supporting more nuanced and creative 3D outputs. A.3 3D Gaussian Splatting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) [29] represents 3D scene using collection of spatial Gaussians. Each Gaussian 𝑔𝑖 is defined by mean position 𝜇𝑖 R3 and covariance matrix Σ𝑖 R33, which determines its shape and orientation. The Gaussians influence on point is given by: Cailin Zhuang, Yaoqi Hu, Xuanyang Zhang, Wei Cheng et al. 𝐺 (x) = 𝑒 1 2 (x𝜇𝑖 ) Σ1 𝑖 (x𝜇𝑖 ) (S4) where Σ𝑖 = RSSR is decomposed into rotation and scaling matrices. Each Gaussian has an opacity 𝛼𝑖 and view-dependent color 𝑐𝑖 . During rendering, Gaussians are projected to 2D and blended using alpha compositing. The final pixel color 𝐶 is calculated as: 𝑛 𝑐𝑖𝛼𝑖 𝑖 1 (cid:214) 𝐶 = (1 𝛼 𝑗 ) (S5) 𝑖=1 𝑗=1 Here, 𝛼𝑖 is the effective opacity of the 𝑖-th Gaussian in sorted depth order. Gaussian Splatting enables real-time, differentiable rendering and can reconstruct scenes with multi-view supervision. Compared to NeRF [47], 3D Gaussian Splatting is significantly more efficient in both time and memory usage. By representing scenes with Gaussian primitives rather than dense neural networks, it allows for faster rendering and lower computational costs, making it more suitable for real-time applications. Implementation Details Computational Environment: All experiments were conducted on single NVIDIA L40S GPU with 46GB of VRAM. Dataset: NeRF synthetic dataset [47] and tandt db [29], was used for all experiments. B.1 Details of Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD) (1) Backbone Models: For the style-aware diffusion model, we adopt StyleShot, which builds on IP-Adapter and incorporates style-aware encoder to enhance style representation, enabling robust style transfer through score distillation guidance. (2) Fine Timestep Sampling: We employ fine-grained timestep sampling strategy with timestep constant = 1000. Minimum and maximum timesteps were set as 𝑇min = 0.02 and 𝑇max = 0.75 T, respectively. The noise intensity was dynamically reduced to high, medium, and low levels to stabilize the updates during training. (3) Dynamic Guidance Coefficients: The dynamic guidance coefficient Δ𝜆 was tuned to adapt to varying scales of the dataset and style variations. For the NeRF Synthetic dataset, we selected 𝜆max = 20 and confined Δ𝜆 within [7.5, 20]. (4) Guidance Modes and Outpainting Strategy: total of 2800 steps were employed, segmented into specific guidance modes: Main RGB Loss (Local Mode): Steps 100 to 600. Adaptive Iteration (Global Mode): Steps 1 to 1000, alternating between global RGB and global SDS losses. Fixed or Free Global Modes: Steps 1000 to 1900, alternating between global-fix and global-free modes. Local Mode: Steps 1900 to 2800. This hybrid strategy begins with global optimization before transitioning to local refinement, requiring 1800 iterations for SDS loss. (5) Iteration Time and Cost Analysis: StyleMe3D: Stylization with Disentangled Priors by Multiple Encoders on 3D Gaussians ArXiv Preprint, 2025, Average Time Per Iteration: Single-view RGB loss averaged 0.1 seconds, while SDS loss averaged 2.5 seconds. Total Iteration Count and Convergence: Using RGB loss for the initial 1000 steps and SDS loss for the subsequent 2000 steps, convergence was achieved in approximately 2600 seconds. For enhanced local convergence, an additional 500 to 1000 SDS iterations were applied.

The plot illustrates the optimization pathways for pre-training (blue solid line) and post-training (orange dashed line), highlighting the optimization gap (gray shaded area) between 3D reconstruction and stylization. The pretraining pathway shows smooth, steady convergence, while the post-training pathway oscillates due to inherent uncertainty in stylization. The optimization gap represents misalignment between the stages, emphasizing the need for alignment techniques, such as style-aware priors and dynamic guidance, to achieve stable and consistent 3D stylization. Disjoint Loss Landscapes: The loss landscapes for pretraining and post-training differ significantly. Pre-training minimizes reconstruction errors, while stylization involves abstract priors from style information, leading to potential misalignment. The optimization pathways during pre-training and post-training can be represented as two distinct loss functions: Lpre = Lrecon (𝐺pre (𝑥), 𝑥gt), (S6) loss = 1 - (0.4*scores[quality] + 0.4*scores[sharpness] + 0.2*scores[colorfullness]).mean() , where 𝑤𝑞 = 0.4, 𝑤𝑠 = 0.4, 𝑤𝑐 = 0.2 denote quality, sharpness, and colorfulness weights respectively."

            "content": "The challenges of directly transferring 3D generation techniques to 3D stylization stem from the optimization gap between pretraining and post-training stages. This section provides theoretical and visual analysis of this gap. C.1 Misalignment in Optimization Pathways Pre-training Objective: The goal of 3D reconstruction during pre-training is to capture geometric and photometric properties accurately. This optimization process is typically smooth and guided by explicit ground truth data. Post-training Objective: In the post-training phase, the focus shifts to aesthetic alignment using style-aware guidance, which lacks explicit supervision and introduces higher uncertainty. where Lrecon minimizes geometric and photometric errors between the predicted 𝐺pre (𝑥) and ground truth 𝑥gt, and: Lpost = Lstyle (𝐺post (𝑥), 𝑠ref), (S7) where Lstyle aligns the generated results 𝐺post (𝑥) with style reference 𝑠ref using abstract priors. The optimization gap can then be formulated as: ΔL = (cid:12) (cid:12)Lpre Lpost(cid:12) (cid:12) , (S8) where ΔL quantifies the divergence between the loss landscapes, reflecting the mismatch in optimization objectives. C.2 High Uncertainty in Style Information Multi-modal Style Representations: Styles are inherently diverse and lack well-defined ground truth, making the optimization process less predictable. Temporal Instability: Stylization optimization pathways often exhibit oscillations due to conflicts between style priors and geometric constraints. ArXiv Preprint, 2025, Cailin Zhuang, Yaoqi Hu, Xuanyang Zhang, Wei Cheng et al. The uncertainty in style optimization can be modeled as the Introducing regularization terms: Lalign = 𝜆priorLstyle + 𝜆geoLrecon, (S14) where 𝜆prior and 𝜆geo balance style fidelity and geometric preservation, helps align the pathways. C.5 Conclusion This analysis highlights the inherent challenges in aligning pretraining and post-training optimization pathways. The visualization emphasizes the need for dedicated techniques to bridge the gap, ensuring high-fidelity and consistent stylization while maintaining geometric coherence."

C.3 Visualization Analysis The graph (Figure S1) visualizes the optimization gap between pre-training and post-training: Pre-training pathway (blue solid line) shows smooth convergence, reflecting steady optimization for geometric fidelity. Post-training pathway (orange dashed line) exhibits oscillations, driven by the abstract and subjective nature of style priors. Optimization gap (gray shaded area) represents the divergence between the two pathways, indicating the challenges of transitioning between the stages. To bridge the optimization gap, alignment strategies must minimize: min 𝐺 ΔL + 𝜆consLconsistency, (S11) where Lconsistency enforces multi-view consistency, and 𝜆cons is weighting factor to balance consistency with style fidelity.
