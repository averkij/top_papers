            "title": "1 Introduction\nLarge language model (LLM) agents are transforming how we in-\nteract with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, moving beyond\nsingle-turn question-answering to autonomously executing com-\nplex, multi-step tasks [1, 31, 76]. These agentic systems decompose\nuser requests, invoke multiple tools [58], and synthesize results\nacross extended processing periods; from searching and comparing\nflight options to analyzing documents and generating comprehen-\nsive reports. This shift from simple query-response to autonomous\ntask execution introduces fundamental design challenges: How\nshould these systems communicate their progress to users dur-\ning lengthy operations? When should they provide updates versus\nworking silently in the background? How much detail is appropri-\nate, and how should feedback adapt to different contexts and user\nneeds?",
            "content": "These questions become particularly acute in dual-task scenarios where users engage with AI assistants while performing other activities Stappen et al. [64]. Consider an in-car voice assistant that handles complex requests while the driver navigates traffic. In such context, poorly designed feedback can create dangerous distractions or cognitive overload [11, 69, 70], while insufficient communication can result in \"ambiguous silence\" [82], leaving users uncertain about system progress and thereby undermining trust and perceived responsiveness [23, 57, 72]. Currently deployed user-facing agentic systems reveal this gap through diverse feedback practices. Cursor [21], which reached one million users within 16 months, operates nearly silently until completion with details on demand. Manus AI [2] provides verbose step-by-step narration, while Perplexity [3] previews steps but withholds intermediate results. This variability, from minimal to maximal transparency, highlights the lack of shared design principles Kirmayr et al. for agentic feedback and underscores the need for open-research guidelines as user-deployed systems become widespread. Decades of HCI research have established well-tested principles for designing system feedback. Yet agentic systems, with their extended processing and autonomous actions, bring new considerations. First, latency is inherent rather than accidental. Prior work demonstrates that unexpected delays degrade user experience [48, 60] and that progress indicators improve perceived responsiveness [49]. However, in agentic systems, the expanded processing time is consequence of intentionally increased reasoning and multi-step tool use, posing the question of whether findings on perceived delay mitigation transfer to waiting time as it becomes expected. Second, the volume of information generated during multi-step processing also expands well beyond typical single-turn interactions, raising questions about cognitive load and information distribution [10]. As described, this is particularly critical in dual-task contexts such as driving, where even lightweight interactions can impair performance. Third, grounded communication requires evidence of both perception and understanding [4, 9, 20]. In long-running agentic systems, it is unclear whether grounding is maintained when perception is acknowledged upfront but evidence of understanding is deferred until the final response, or whether users expect transparency throughout the process. Finally, trust is known to be key factor in humanAI relationships, as it often determines whether system is adopted and relied upon [72]. Prior work shows that transparency mechanisms such as explanations can foster trust [47, 84]. For agentic systems, this raises questions about which forms of feedback best support users in calibrating trust during extended and autonomous processing. To address the gap between emerging agentic capabilities and established feedback design principles, we investigate the feedback design for an LLM-based agentic in-car assistant through mixedmethods study (N = 45) in controlled car simulation environment. We focus on three critical dimensions: (1) feedback timing whether systems should provide intermediate informative updates during processing or deliver results only upon completion; (2) interaction context how feedback strategies perform when the AI assistant is the primary versus secondary task alongside driving; and (3) adaptive verbosity how feedback detail should evolve with situational demands and long-term use. Our quantitative experiments reveal that intermediate feedback consistently outperforms end-only delivery across multiple metrics and interaction context. Providing planned steps and incremental results during processing increased perceived speed (𝑑𝑧 = 1.01), improved user experience (𝑑𝑧 = 0.54), enhanced trust (𝑑𝑧 = 0.38), and, surprisingly, reduced task load (𝑑𝑧 = 0.26) despite multiple interaction points, compared to silent processing followed by comprehensive final response. Complementing these findings, our qualitative interview analysis uncovers sophisticated adaptation preferences. Participants envisioned systems that initially provide transparent, detailed feedback to establish trust, then progressively reduce verbosity in favor of efficiency as the system proves reliable. Yet they expected transparency to immediately return for novel, ambiguous, or high-stakes requests. Preferences varied regarding context-aware adaptation in social settings and media consumption, with consistent desire for simple override controls when automatic adaptation was unsatisfactory. Effects of Intermediate Feedback from Agentic LLM In-Car Assistants During Multi-Step Processing Contribution Statement. Our empirical findings advance agentic in-car assistant design through: (1) Empirical evidence from controlled in-car study (N=45) showing that intermediate, informative updates during extended agent operation improve responsiveness, trust, and user experience across singleand dual-task contexts; (2) Adaptive verbosity patterns from qualitative interviews showing that users desire adaptive feedback detail that decreases as they experience system reliability over time, but increases situationally for novel, ambiguous, or high-stakes tasks; and (3) Design implications for feedback design and adaptation in in-car singleand dual-task interaction, with potential relevance to other primarytask systems (e.g., customer support) and dual-task contexts (e.g., smart-home assistants while cooking). Latency and Waiting. Delays in system responses have long been shown to degrade user experience. Early work demonstrated that response delays decrease satisfaction [48, 60] and that unexpected waiting increases frustration [60]. In voice interfaces, such delays may even lead users to assume the system has failed [57] or that an error has occurred [23]. Nielsen highlights 10 seconds as an upper bound for keeping users attention during waiting periods [50, p.135]. Succesful mitigation strategies include progress indicators [49], conversation fillers [45], and explanations of ongoing processing [84]. While such strategies reduce anxiety and foster trust, their effectiveness in agentic systems, where latency is not accidental but an expected and productive aspect of multi-step reasoning, remains underexplored."

            "content": "Current systems vary widely from minimal (Cursor [21]) to verbose (Manus [2]) feedback. This diversity reflects different implicit assumptions about user needs. Cursors minimal approach embodies \"stay out of the way\" philosophy, prioritizing uninterrupted workflow over transparency. This implies intermediate details may distract expert users, and suits contexts where users have established trust or where processing steps remain technical rather than decision-relevant. Manuss verbose approach implies that transparency builds trust and helps users maintain situational awareness, though risking information overload. Perplexitys [3] hybrid strategy, showing plans but not intermediate results, attempts to balance expectations management with efficiency. These systems exemplify the diversity of feedback strategies deployed in practice. At the same time, they also underscore the need for empirically grounded design principles. With companies rarely publishing their design rationales or formative studies, the open research community lacks systematic guidance on how feedback strategies should align with varying user needs and task contexts."

            "content": "Grounding and Communication. Research on humanAI communication builds on foundational studies of human communication and human teamwork. Grounding communication theory [20] highlights that effective collaboration requires maintaining common ground, meaning shared knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions. This common ground must be updated continuously, not only about content but also about the process of interaction. Brennan [14] further extends this to human-computer interaction, emphasizing that people need to be able to seek evidence that they are understood, with Yankelovich et al. [82] stating that the absence of feedback leaves the user in an ambiguous silence. In agentic systems, where single user request initiates extended multi-step reasoning, grounding becomes more complex. The question is whether continuous intermediate updates have to be provided or if an upfront indication of perception with deferred condensed final answer suffices to maintain common ground. Trust and Transparency. Trust is central in humanAI interaction, influencing whether users rely on or reject system support [72]. Lee and See [41] define trust as an attitude that an agent will achieve an individuals goal in situation characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability. In the case of agentic systems, users expose themselves to such vulnerability when delegating complex requests to the system. For trust to emerge and persist, users must clearly understand what they can expect. Transparency is widely recognized as means of fostering trust [47], with explanations that align user expectations and system behavior [42, 84]. Empirical findings from humanAI collaboration confirm that transparency enhances trust, especially when systems make their reasoning explicit [75]. Hoff and Bashir [29] further distinguishes trust in automation into dispositional trust as the persons general tendency to trust automation, situational trust in given context, and learned trust by prior experience. For agentic systems, situational and learned trust are particularly important, as they indicate the need for dynamic feedback design. Importantly, in dual-task contexts such as driving, transparency must be carefully balanced: feedback must establish trust without overloading cognitive resources. Human Oversight. Oversight on AI systems encompasses two concepts: passive oversight (monitoring) and active oversight (human intervention) [5, 40, 66]. Its primary goal is to enable humans to detect and correct errors in else autonomous AI decisions, which remain prone to inconsistency and limited self-awareness under real-world uncertainty [36]. This human-AI collaboration can lead to improved agent performance [28], and user control can increase trust in the system [22]. However, research also highlights critical limitations: humans often overtrust plausible AI outputs or override accurate ones, undermining effective human oversight [28]. Additionally, human involvement substantially increases cognitive load on them [28]. Therefore, effective oversight requires careful design. Sterz et al. [66] emphasize that humans need epistemic access, including sufficient understanding of what the system is doing and why. This requires delivering the right transparency at the right time and format to support monitoring without overloading cognition, challenge that intensifies as inter-agent communication introduces novel threat vectors in safety-critical domains [65]. This motivates our research question on designing agentic feedback for clear comprehension."

            "content": "Multimodal Feedback and Cognitive Resources. Work on multimodal feedback highlights strategies for distributing information across sensory channels. Wickens Multiple Resource Theory suggests that tasks utilizing different perceptual modalities draw from separate cognitive resource pools, reducing interference [79]. This principle proves particularly relevant for in-vehicle interaction, where auditory-vocal tasks interfere less with vehicle control than visual-manual ones [30]. However, modality selection involves trade-offs: auditory feedback preserves visual attention but lacks persistence [15], while visual feedback provides spatial detail but requires potentially dangerous gaze shifts [16]. Oviatt and Cohen [55] shows that coordinating modalities, using audio cues to direct attention to visual information, can reduce cognitive load compared to single-modality approaches. For agentic systems with extended multi-step feedback, distributing information across modalities over time without overwhelming any single channel becomes central design challenge. Secondary Task Distraction in Driving and Automotive Interface Design. Even lightweight activities can impair driving performance: hands-free conversations shrink the functional field of view [7], and voice-based interactions impose moderate cognitive workload [68 70]. Driver distraction is major safety factor in crashes [11], yet drivers consistently underestimate its impact [78]. Consequently, automotive HCI research has focused on designing assistants that minimize distraction through careful modality choice. Speech interfaces have been found to generally outperform visual-manual [43] and touchor gesture-based [83] alternatives on driving performance measures. Braun et al. [13] show that still visualizing natural language alongside speech improves information recall through text summaries, while keywords reduce cognitive load and icons increase attractiveness. Nevertheless, even basic voice interactions, such as dictating text messages, elevate cognitive workload compared to undistracted driving [44]. More recently, researchers have begun investigating LLM-powered conversational agents in vehicles. Sorokin et al. [62] examine multimodal systems combining voice and graphical interfaces, arguing that maintaining mutual understanding between the user and LLM requires bidirectional translation: informing users of the AIs focus and changes while making user actions legible to the model. The importance of shared visual context in such settings is further underlined by work on spatial referencing in in-car voice interfaces [32]. However, existing studies largely address short, reactive interactions: command execution, clarification dialogues, or navigation updates. Comparatively little empirical work examines feedback design for long-running, agentic in-vehicle assistants that autonomously perform multi-step tasks. Following Normans principle that design must align with user needs and cognitive limits [51], agentic systems must carefully balance trust-building transparency with cognitive safety. Feedback strategies should therefore support trust development while minimizing distraction, ideally increasing responsiveness perception and overall user experience. Kirmayr et al."

During the quantitative study (cf. Sec. 4.3.1), participants interacted with the voice assistant in two interaction contexts: stationary (single-task), where they sat in the car without performing the additional lane-keeping task, and driving (dual-task), where they concurrently performed the driving-related task. The driving-related task required participants to maintain lane position by continuously correcting lateral drift.

Participants used mouse clicks to control lateral vehicle position. This arrangement enabled controlled manipulation of cognitive load and provided consistent basis for comparing feedback preferences between single-task and dual-task situations. 4.1.2 LLM-based Voice-Assistant System. Our research team had previously developed fully functional agentic LLM-based in-car voice assistant capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks with real-time intermediate feedback. This system served as the foundation for our study, providing realistic interaction flows and response timings. Based on this, for the user study, we created prototype in ProtoPie and deployed it on tablet simulating the vehicles center display. This study-specific LLM-inspired prototype ensured strict comparability across all conditions in the within-subject design. For each task configuration, the target utterance was shown on-screen for participants to read aloud. The system transcribed the spoken input in real-time and displayed the transcription on-screen, signaling to participants that their input had been received. Upon receiving the voice input, the prototype system triggered the corresponding deterministic interaction sequence, delivering visual and auditory outputs at fixed timesteps according to the configuration of one of the eight interaction tasks (cf. Figure 3 and Figure 4). Thus, unlike the working system with its dynamic LLM-generated responses, the study prototype used predefined LLM-inspired responses and fixed response timings to ensure experimental control and reproducibility, while the visible real-time transcription preserved the experience of interacting with live system. 1We provide screen videos of the ProtoPie implementation at https://github.com/ johanneskirmayr/agentic_llm_feedback."

            "content": "As result, shown in Figure 3, each participant performs 8 tasks across the 2 2 2 conditions. IV1: Feedback Timing. To study the effects of feedback timing, we contrasted two complementary system behaviors. The No Intermediate (NI) feedback condition served as strong baseline: after the participants request was spoken, the system confirmed perception with clicking sound and visual message am planning. . . on the center screen, but then remained silent until delivering the final response. This setup reflects how many AI agents operate and is particularly relevant in dual-task settings such as driving, where silence and background operation reduce interruptions and let the assistant get out of the way. In contrast, the Planning & Results (PR) feedback condition represented transparent approach, providing informative intermediate updates during processing in addition to final summary. This condition aims to mitigate uncertainty during waiting and to distribute the increased information load across smaller, progressive steps rather than presenting it all condensed at once. Intermediate updates are conveyed auditorily and complemented by visual display, which has been shown to be an effective design choice [13]. We also considered including third condition with minimal progress cues (e.g., simple signals or conversation fillers, such as \"working on it\"). Prior work has already repeatedly shown that such cues improve perceived latency and user experience [45, 49]. Given the already large design space and the novel dimension of increased information load to be conveyed, we chose not to include this condition here; instead, we revisit whether minimal cues could suffice in the discussion (Section 6.1.2). IV2: Task Duration. As second independent variable, we varied task duration by designing two tasks with different complexity: medium-duration task with 3 intermediate steps and longduration task with 6 intermediate steps. Figure 4 illustrates the two tasks along with the content and timing of intermediate updates and final responses for the respective feedback timing conditions. As displayed, intermediate updates for PR were presented at fixed 5-second intervals; this corresponded to the empirical average step duration in our agentic in-car assistant prototype across different LLM models (GPT-4o [52], Claude-Sonnet-4-Thinking [6], Gemini2.5-Flash-Thinking [71]). This interval is also below the 10-second threshold identified by [50] as the upper limit for maintaining user attention. We provide screen videos of the ProtoPie implementation of the visual and auditive feedback for the different tasks in the supplementary material. To avoid confounding effects of verbosity in the timing study, the appropriate level of detail for feedback in the two task examples was determined in pre-study with (N=7) institutional HCI experts working on user experience in the LLMbased in-car voice assistant. Across the eight tasks, interchangeable Kirmayr et al. attributes (e.g., [fastest shortest] route, [McDonalds Bakery], [20% 10%] battery) were permuted to minimize task memorization and repeated answers, while keeping the tasks conceptually equivalent. The user requests given to participants were deliberately explicit, hinting at the number and type of steps the assistant would take. Explicit requests aimed to reduce variability in expectations across participants with different technical backgrounds. IV3: Interaction Context. As third independent variable, we varied the interaction context between single-task and dual-task setting. In the stationary (single-task) condition, participants interacted with the voice assistant as their sole task while sitting in the stationary car-mockup. In the driving (dual-task) condition, participants additionally performed the driving-related lane-keeping task described in Section 4.1.1, while the voice-assistant interaction remained unchanged. The vehicle did not physically move; instead, the task simulated core attentional demands of driving. In this setting, the lane-keeping task naturally takes priority, relegating the voice assistant interaction to secondary task. We included this manipulation as the concurrent task is expected to reduce available cognitive resources for processing feedback and may make waiting periods feel less idle, both potentially influencing preferred feedback timing and perceived system speed. We thus conceptualize this manipulation primarily as singleversus dual-task comparison rather than an investigation of vehicle motion. While an alternative design, comparing manual with automated driving, could isolate task demands from perceived motion, our conditions capture ecologically valid scenarios: pre-trip navigation setup versus in-drive query. 4.3.2 Dependent Variables and Measurement. To capture the effects of feedback timing, task duration, and context, we measured four dependent variables (DVs) that reflect responsiveness, workload, user experience, and trust: Perceived Speed (DV1): single custom 7-point Likert item (1 = very slow, 7 = very fast) (cf. [84]). This directly measures perceived responsiveness, the most immediate effect of feedback timing and task duration. Task Load (DV2): Three NASA-TLX [27] subscales (Mental Demand, Temporal Demand, Frustration) on 0100 scale (0 = very low, 100 = very high). These capture cognitive demands and frustration, particularly relevant in dual-task settings such as driving. Physical Demand, Performance, and Effort were excluded because tasks were non-physical and largely reactive. It should be noted that we report the unweighted average of the included subscales (Raw TLX, RTLX [26]); this allows for comparisons across our experimental conditions, due to subscale exclusion it should not be compared directly to full NASA-TLX scores in other experiments. User Experience (DV3): Three UEQ+ [59] subscales (Attractiveness (overall impression), Dependability (perceived control and predictability), and Risk Handling (ability to detect and handle risks)) on 7-point scale (3 = strongly negative, +3 = strongly positive). These capture pragmatic and hedonic qualities of real-time feedback, allowing us to assess overall acceptance and perceived control.

Trust (DV4): The short form of the TIAS, S-TIAS [46], which covers Confidence, Reliability, and Trustworthiness on 7-point scale (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) and focuses on trust in artificial intelligence. Trust was measured to capture how different feedback strategies influence users confidence in the assistants behavior. Table 2 summarizes the DVs, including when they were measured and the factorial structure applied in analysis. By design, User Experience and Task Load were collapsed across the condition of task duration. Although task length may influence these measures, our focus was on comparing feedback systems across contexts; duration was included primarily to span plausible range of complexity and duration, with detailed effects analyzed only for perceived speed, as this is the most sensitive measure of waiting. Similarly, Trust was measured once per feedback timing condition as we targeted system-level trust (confidence/reliability/trust in assistant) rather than context-specific preferences. Testing differences between the study interaction context condition would provide limited generalizability given numerous possible contexts (stressful driving, media consumption, etc.) beyond our study scope. Notably, participants experienced both interaction contexts before providing their trust judgment, allowing them to form holistic system-level trust assessments. For the specific context variance included in our study, we expected user experience measures to provide more insightful metrics for context-related preferences. This design also reduces questionnaire burden. Kirmayr et al. Figure 4: Quantitative study tasks: User requests for the two tasks with different durations, along with the assistants final responses for the No Intermediate (NI) feedback system and assistant updates & final response for the Planning & Results (PR) feedback system. As the final answer is longer for the NI feedback system, it was started earlier (at 18s compared to 20s, respectively at 33s compared to 35s) so that the last output is at the same time for both systems. Note that at the beginning of both systems (NI and PR), clicking sound, accompanied by the visual message \"I am planning,\" is played to indicate the perception of the user request. Figure 5: Task order and measurement timing: each participant performed all 8 tasks in hierarchically counterbalanced and randomized order. Dependent variables were measured (white boxes with black border) either after each task (perceived speed), after 2-task block (UEQ+: user experience, NASA RTLX: task load), or after all 4 tasks per feedback system (S-TIAS: trust). 4.3.3 Task Order and Measurement Timing.

As shown in Figure 5, perceived speed was rated after each task, task load and user experience were measured after each two-task block, and trust was measured once per feedback system after four tasks. 4.3.4 Quantitative Analysis. We use repeated-measures ANOVAs with within-subject factors Feedback Timing (NI, PR), Context (Stationary, Driving), and, where applicable, Task Duration (Medium, Effects of Intermediate Feedback from Agentic LLM In-Car Assistants During Multi-Step Processing High) or Subscale. Planned paired t-tests are used to unpack main and interaction effects. When multiple cell-wise comparisons are tested (Perceived Speed across Duration Context), we apply Holm correction. We report F, p, partial eta squared (𝜂2 𝑝 ) for ANOVAs and t, 95% CI, and Cohens 𝑑𝑧 for paired contrasts. Additionally, for multi-item measures for one scale, internal consistency is assessed using Cronbachs 𝛼. 4.3.5 Quantitative Hypotheses. Based on prior work on latency, cognitive load, and trust in interactive systems, we formulate the following hypotheses for our quantitative study: H1: Feedback Timing Effects (RQ1): PR feedback (a) increases perceived speed compared to NI, (b) increases subjective task load compared to NI, (c) improves user experience, (d) increases user trust compared to NI. H2: Interaction Context and Task Duration Effects (RQ1, RQ2): (a) Driving context increases subjective task load compared to stationary and (b) longer task duration decreases perceived speed."

Follow-up prompts were used as needed to clarify or elaborate on participants responses. 4.4.2 Qualitative Analysis. We transcribed the audio recordings of the 45 semi-structured interviews and cleaned the data. We then analyzed the transcripts using thematic analysis [12] and Atlas.ti. Two researchers independently open-coded random subset of 20% of the data. During this phase, the focus was on maintaining close proximity to participants language and experiences while generating granular codes such as interruption reduction during media interaction or mute on demand. The researchers then met in person to compare their initial codes, resolve discrepancies, and consolidate overlapping codes. Through this discussion, shared codebook was developed consisting of 18 codes organized into preliminary conceptual groupings. Using this codebook, we divided the remaining transcripts equally for coding. Finally, the researchers reconvened to review coded extracts, refine code groups, and iteratively develop overarching themes. The researchers refined conceptual boundaries, distinguishing, for example, external real-time adaptation (media/social context) from internal real-time adaptations (task ambiguity, task novelty). This resulted in five themes capturing participants preferences and rationales for feedback timing, verbosity, and adaptive feedback2."

Collapsing across all conditions, perceived speed was significantly higher with large effect under PR compared to NI feedback (𝑡 (44) = 7.67, 𝑝 < .001, 95% CI [0.90, 1.54], 𝑑𝑧 = 1.01) (ref. Figure 6), supporting H1a. Additionally, three-way interaction Timing Duration Context emerged, 𝐹 (1, 44) = 4.09, 𝑝 = .049, 𝜂2 𝑝 = .09. Planned contrasts showed that PR feedback significantly outperformed NI feedback across all Duration Context combinations (all 𝑝 < .001, 𝑑𝑧 = 0.580.95), with the largest advantage for long tasks in the stationary single-task context (𝑑𝑧 = 0.95). We also observed main effect of Duration, 𝐹 (1, 44) = 12.33, 𝑝 = .001, 𝜂2 𝑝 = .22, with longer tasks reducing perceived speed, 𝑡 (44) = 3.51, 𝑝 = .001, 95% CI [0.55, 0.15], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.52, supporting H2b. Planned contrasts revealed that the reduction in perceived speed from Medium to High duration was significant under NI feedback and Stationary context (𝑡 (44) = 3.54, 𝑝 = .001, 95% CI [1.22, 0.53], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.52). This implies that intermediate feedback buffered the negative impact of longer task duration on perceived speed, especially during the single-task condition (cf. Figure 7). 5.1.2 Task Load (H1b, H2a). 223 RM-ANOVA with factors Timing (NI vs. PR), Context (Stationary vs. Driving), and Subscale (Mental Demand, Temporal Demand, Frustration) revealed main effect of Timing (𝐹 (1, 44) = 4.79, 𝑝 = .034, 𝜂2 𝑝 = .10), and an approaching but no significant main effect of Context (𝐹 (1, 44) = 3.96, 𝑝 = .053). Collapsing across subscales and contexts, task load was, unexpectedly, significantly lower with small effect under PR compared to NI feedback (𝑡 (44) = 2.19, 𝑝 = .034, 95% CI [8.54, 0.35], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.26) (ref. Figure 6), contradicting H1b, which expected PR to increase task load due to multiple interaction points. Further planned contrasts showed this reduction was primarily driven by the Frustration subscale (𝑡 (44) = 2.04, 𝑝 = .047, 95% CI [12.81, 0.08], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.26), while Mental and Temporal Demand did not differ significantly (all 𝑝 > .10). Cronbachs 𝛼 = .77 indicated acceptable internal consistency for the composite. Finally, Effects of Intermediate Feedback from Agentic LLM In-Car Assistants During Multi-Step Processing Figure 7: Perceived speed by task duration (medium, 26s vs. high, 45s) and interaction context (stationary vs. driving) for NI vs. PR feedback timing. Intermediate feedback reduced the negative slope in perceived speed for longer tasks. although task load tended to be higher in the driving than the stationary context, this effect did not reach significance (𝑝 = .053), thus providing no clear support for H2a. 5.1.3 User Experience (H1c). 223 RM-ANOVA with factors Timing (NI vs. PR), Context (Stationary vs. Driving), and Subscale (Attractiveness, Dependability, Risk Handling) revealed strong main effect of Timing (𝐹 (1, 44) = 12.09, 𝑝 = .001, 𝜂2 𝑝 = .22), but no main effect of Context (𝑝 = .85) and no Timing Context interaction (𝑝 = .32). Collapsing across contexts, intermediate feedback (PR) significantly improved all three user experience subscales with small to medium effect compared to final-only feedback (NI): Attractiveness (𝑡 (44) = 2.29, 𝑝 = .027, 95% CI [0.04, 0.66], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.38), Dependability (𝑡 (44) = 2.44, 𝑝 = .019, 95% CI [0.07, 0.72], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.47), and Risk Handling (𝑡 (44) = 3.90, 𝑝 < .001, 95% CI [0.35, 1.10], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.60), with the strongest effect observed for Risk Handling. Cronbachs 𝛼 indicated good reliability for all multi-item measures of the subscales (𝛼 = .74.86). Using the UEQ+ KPI weighting by self-reported importance of each subscale, PR feedback also improved the overall user experience composite score with medium effect size (𝑡 (44) = 3.30, 𝑝 = .002, 95% CI [0.06, 0.24], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.54)(ref. Figure 6), supporting H1c. 5.1.4 User Trust (H1d). Trust was measured once per participant for each feedback condition after completing all tasks for that condition. Collapsing across all contexts and durations, trust ratings were significantly higher with small effect under intermediate feedback (PR) compared to final-only feedback (NI) (𝑡 (44) = 2.10, 𝑝 = .042, 95% CI [0.01, 0.60], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.38), supporting H1d. Internal consistency for the three S-TIAS items (confidence in the system, reliability, and trustworthiness) was good (Cronbachs 𝛼 = 0.84). At the subscale level, PR feedback significantly improved Reliability (𝑡 (44) = 2.20, 𝑝 = .033, 95% CI [0.03, 0.60], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.41) and Trustworthiness (𝑡 (44) = 2.41, 𝑝 = .020, 95% CI [0.05, 0.61], 𝑑𝑧 = 0.34), but not Confidence (𝑝 = .194). Counterbalancing ensured that overall trust scores were not affected by order. Nevertheless, as trust can be learned through experience [29], we tested for order effects. 2x2 mixed ANOVA with Timing (NI vs. PR) as within-subject factor and Order (NI-first vs. PR-first) revealed no significant main effect of Order (𝑝 = .418) and no significant Timing Order interaction (𝑝 = .083). Summary of Duration and Context Effects. Perceived speed 5.1.5 showed significant Timing Duration interaction (𝑝 = .049), where intermediate feedback buffered the negative effect of longer tasks. For the other DVs, the effect of duration was not separately measured. Interaction Context (stationary vs. driving) produced no consistent main or interaction effects; trend toward higher task load while driving (𝑝 = .053) did not reach significance, and no Timing Context interactions were observed. Overall, intermediate feedback consistently improved perceived speed, user experience, and trust while unexpectedly reducing task load; duration mainly affected perceived speed, whereas interaction context showed no consistent effects across dependent variables. Summary of Demographic and Familiarity Effects. No signifi5.1.6 cant main effects of age or familiarity with LLMs, voice assistants, or the companys voice assistant were observed on any dependent variable. However, moderation analyses revealed that higher LLM familiarity significantly amplified improvements in trust (𝑝 = .017, 𝑑𝑧 = 0.74) and user experience (𝑝 = .021, 𝑑𝑧 = 0.72) from NI to PR feedback conditions. This pattern may reflect PR feedbacks structural similarity to Chain-of-Thought [77] reasoning outputs typical of LLMs, though alternative explanations warrant investigation. No additional moderation effects reached significance. Future research with larger sample size may better capture the influence of demographic variables and technical familiarity. actions (e.g., choosing fast-food stop), many preferred the assistant to proceed with minimal dialog: McDonalds, just take the faster one (P5). Finally, participants highlighted novelty as cue for more transparency: As long as the information is new and not repeated, its relevant to me (P16). Kirmayr et al."

            "content": "5.2.1 T1: Longitudinal adaptation should be gated by trust and enabled by learning. Across interviews, participants emphasized that feedback verbosity should decrease over time when the system has proven itself and learned their routines. Most described trust as the primary precondition for reducing transparency; some explicitly tied this to repeated successful outcomes and predictable behavior. As P1 noted, Trust only grows over time-when it delivers good results consistently. Echoing this, P28 suggested, With more trust, it can say less. Participants also articulated how such reductions would be operationalized: the system should recognize recurrent tasks and remember prior choices to streamline future interactions. P9 commented, For recurring complex tasks, it could keep it shorter. Similarly, P35 proposed, It should remember my answers and ask fewer questions next time. While participants generally endorsed this progression, they also implied that reduced transparency should remain reversible if trust is challenged. 5.2.2 T2: Real-time external adaptation: balancing responsiveness with social and media context. Participants advocated for feedback that adapts to the surrounding situation, particularly media and social contexts, yet views diverged on how much to reduce interruptions. Several participants preferred minimal intermediate speech while listening to music or podcasts; P39 said, With music on, one condensed summary would be better. P2 added, Its annoying if things are said multiple times during podcast. In contrast, others wanted consistent output regardless of concurrent media: Even with music, want the output when ask for it (P31; see also P35, P42). Social presence introduced additional sensitivity: some felt continuous intermediate speech could be intrusive with passengersWith passenger, intermediate steps could be more tiring (P13), and preferred single end summary to avoid disrupting conversation (e.g., P22). 5.2.3 T3: Real-time internal adaptation: task ambiguity, stakes, and novelty heighten transparency needs. Participants reached clear consensus that ambiguity requires clarification independent of trust. It should ask follow-up questions when something is ambiguous (P6; see also P7, P10). They further differentiated between highand low-stakes actions: for decisions with higher consequence or higher error cost, most participants wanted verification and intermediate checkpoints: With contacts, its important to ask (P4); With emails, lot can go wrong (P13). In contrast, for low-stakes 5.2.4 T4: Active user control as safety valve for feedback. Regardless of context policy, there was broad support for lightweight, user-driven controls to modulate verbosity. Participants repeatedly requested way to mute or dampen spoken feedback when needed. P23 stated, want to choose how much information get, mute is very important. P11 was even more direct: should be able to tell it not to talk. Participants suggested using such controls especially during media playback or when passengers are present (e.g., P44). 5.2.5 T5: Progressive chunking lightens cognitive load compared to end-only dumps. Participants contrasted progressive, small updates with cognitively heavier all at once delivery. P1 put it succinctly: Its the same information, but complete dump is harder to absorb. Several echoed that stepwise updates made the process feel lighter and easier to follow than dense end summary."

While participants were briefed on these mechanisms\nand given explicit requests that hinted at multi-step processing,\nlatency may still have felt unexpected at times due to misaligned\nmental models [34, 67].",
            "content": "Intermediate updates were particularly helpful for longer, more complex tasks: perceived speed declined under final-only feedback but was buffered by stepwise updates. This underscores the importance of sustaining sense of progress as task duration increases. The strongest effects were observed when interacting without secondary task, suggesting that idle waiting is especially pronounced. While benefits were also observed during dual-task interaction, the moderation effects were weaker, and for other dependent variables, we did not find significant interactions with context or duration. This highlights robustness but also underscores the need for in-thewild validation under more varied dual-task demands. Design implication: From the users perspective, agentic in-car assistants should provide intermediate updates during long-running, multi-step tasks if possible, particularly as task complexity grows. This guideline is most critical in early phases of adoption when Effects of Intermediate Feedback from Agentic LLM In-Car Assistants During Multi-Step Processing overall trust is still developing. Benefits hold across both stationary and driving contexts, but may vary with situational trust or when competing attentional demands alter user priorities (see Section 6.2.2). 6.1.2 Are simple progress cues enough, or must updates include content? natural design question is whether lightweight progress indicators (such as auditory fillers, e.g., \"working on it\", or visual and haptic cues) could substitute for content-rich updates, especially once trust has been established. Our results and related work suggest otherwise. Early work on ambiguous silence showed that minimal feedback leaves users uncertain about what the system is doing [82], problem documented in voice interfaces [57] and reflected in theories of grounding: communication requires not just perception-level confirmation (I heard you) but also understanding-level evidence (I understood what you meant)[4, 9, 19]. If intermediate steps are hidden until the final response, users are deprived of understandinglevel feedback throughout the wait. This forces them into laborious checking behaviors to re-establish common ground, dynamic well described in conversational grounding research [14]. Trust research supports this interpretation: Zhang et al. [84] found that simply notifying users of delay is insufficient, while providing justifications for what is happening increases trust. Our workload results reinforce the point that when identical information is delivered in smaller steps, task load decreases significantly, with small effect size, compared to receiving single condensed final response. Participant explanations (T5) complement this: they described stepwise updates as cognitively lighter than dense dumps. This is also important to enable effective human oversight, as Sterz et al. [66] outlines that epistemic access, including comprehending what the agent is doing, is important. An analogy to visual driver distraction guidelines is interesting: AAM standards restrict individual glances to in-car displays while driving to two seconds and cumulative glances to complete one task to 20 seconds [13, 25]. single long information dump parallels prolonged glance, intensifying momentary distraction, whereas stepwise updates are akin to multiple brief glances - each less demanding and less disruptive to ongoing tasks. Design implication: Content-bearing intermediate updates appear more effective than progress-only cues. They help preserve grounding, maintain trust, and distribute cognitive effort more evenly across time. This holds when the cognitive feedback channel (e.g., auditive) is available; if not, updates might be experienced as interruptive, and user preferences can differ (see Section 6.2.2). One promising direction to gain efficiency while maintaining these benefits is through learned cue associations. As users learn mappings between simple cues and specific system actions, those cues can effectively convey the content of what the assistant is doing without verbose language. Cho et al. [18] demonstrate this approach with direct multimodal feedback cues in repetitive tasks, reducing cognitive load while preserving informational value."

            "content": "in verbosity were only acceptable once the in-car assistant had demonstrated reliability. Trust was described as the decisive factor, developing over time through repeated successful interactions. This resonates with Hoff and Bashir [29] three layers of trust: dispositional, situational, and learned. In our qualitative findings, learned trust - understood as users emerging confidence grounded in experienced reliability - was central for long-term verbosity adaption. As the system repeatedly performed well, participants expressed willingness to accept less transparency in favor of greater efficiency. This illustrates trajectory where transparency, represented by intermediate feedback, initially outweighs efficiency due to its benefits for perceived speed, trust, and task load. Over time, as learned trust grows, verbosity can be scaled back without eroding confidence in the system. Reversibility was mentioned (T1) by some participants, but is inherently part of this learned-trust-dependent adaptation: when reliability falters, transparency must reappear. Design implication: Our empirical findings suggest that feedback verbosity should start high to establish transparency, then decrease as the system demonstrates reliability. This trajectory treats demonstrated reliability as practical proxy for learned trust, enabling efficiency without undermining confidence. 6.2.2 Real-time situational context adaptation - internal vs. external factors. Participants described the need for real-time adjustments to feedback, shaped by both internal task factors and external situational factors. For internal factors (T3), situational trust was crucial: when task was novel or ambiguous, participants sought greater transparency, regardless of their prior experience. This supports prior work showing that explanations are most valuable when outcomes are uncertain or likely to surprise the user [63]. Similarly, high-stakes requests such as contacting people or handling emails were seen as requiring verification, whereas routine or low-stakes actions could be handled more efficiently with minimal verbosity. This highlights the need for transparency to scale with task stakes, enabling human control and potential intervention, which Dietvorst et al. [22] found to increase user trust . By contrast, external context factors (T2), such as media consumption or social interaction in the car, produced divergent preferences. Some participants preferred condensed, final-only summary to avoid interruptions, while others valued consistent updates independent of distractions. Because no uniform policy fits all, userfacing controls (e.g., mute button or voice command) become an effective and wanted (T4) practical way to resolve mismatches between system adaptation and individual preferences. Although not explicitly mentioned by participants, we hypothesize that verbosity controls should also permit the expansion of detail on demand for instance, through the visual unfolding of step within an interface element, or in response to user-initiated clarification requests. Design implication: Our qualitative findings suggest that verbosity should be increased when task factors are novel, ambiguous, or high-stakes and can be reduced for routine or low-stakes requests. External context adaptation remains more contested: until robust personalization methods exist, systems might provide simple user controls for in-the-moment overrides. Kirmayr et al. Long-term verbosity adaptation based on demonstrated reliability. Our empirical findings indicate that users prefer an adaptive system that reduces feedback verbosity, as they perceive sufficient reliability. This relates to Googles PAIR guidebook on trust, which identifies ten levers of trust [24]; our findings specifically reveal dynamic relationship between two of these levers: Reliance, indicating how much users can depend on the system, and Transparency, which helps users understand and predict agent responses. While trust itself is latent variable that cannot be directly measured [73, 80], the relationship between the more objective demonstrated reliability from interaction history and verbosity preferences may offer more tractable direction for future system design. Prior work on online trust estimation, using Bayesian Networks to infer user trust states in robot-collaborative settings [81] or Finite State Automata to model trust from acceptance behaviors [74], may inform future operational approaches. Trust-related behavioral signals from interaction history, such as acceptances, interruptions, corrections, rejections, and override rates, are commonly used and may serve as practical proxies for demonstrated reliability, potentially yielding systems better aligned with the preferences we identified. Future work would need to determine which signals best estimate demonstrated reliability and identify appropriate verbosity adaptation levels. Situational verbosity adaptation based on task novelty, stakes, and confidence. Novelty can be estimated from memory and task history [37, 56], and stakes are often estimable in closed domains with limited action space. In contrast, detecting ambiguity remains an open challenge and is an active research area [38]. Current LLMs internal confidence assessments are yet poorly calibrated [35, 85], limiting reliable detection. These challenges, informed by our empirical findings, offer concrete entry points for future systems research on agentic feedback."

In dual-task contexts with different channels, examples include smart home assistants used during everyday activities, such as cooking [33], or emerging wearable agents that deliver feedback via audio or haptics alongside physical tasks. Here, along with feedback timing implications, our results on verbosity adaptation based on internal task factors and lightweight user control may help strike balance between responsiveness and flexibility. Regarding temporal scope, our implications target agentic systems with execution times ranging from multiple seconds to one minute. They likely do not extend to \"deep agent\" systems, such as OpenAIs Deep Research [54], which operate over multiple minutes to half an hour. Such extended durations naturally push interactions into background processing, as sustained intermediate feedback across many minutes would likely overwhelm users rather than maintain engagement. This distinction raises an interesting research question for future work: identifying the temporal threshold where agentic systems should transition from maintaining user attention to background operation. Finally, the application of our implications ultimately also depends on domainand modality-specific constraints. Just as driving imposes limits on distractions, other domains will have their own boundaries. Our insights may inform design considerations in other domains, but likely require adaptation to specific contextual constraints rather than direct transfer."
