            "content": "We are in the midst of technological transformation. With the rapid year-by-year and month-bymonth progress brought about by large language models (LLMs), we are seeing AI-based assistance or automation become commonplace in tasks that were unthinkable only few years ago. In fact, the pace of progress is so fast that some have gone so far as to claim that the majority of human labor may be automatable within the next couple of years (Eloundou et al., 2023; Amodei & Fridman, 2024). On the other hand, others are skeptical, claiming that language models cannot truly reason (Kambhampati et al., 2024), do not generalize well to novel tasks (Chollet et al., 2024), and may only have an impact on small minority of the labor market (Wittenstein, 2024). What is the reason for this disconnect? We argue that it is, in part, due to lack of objective benchmarks that not only demonstrate the power of existing LLM-based agents to accelerate Equal contribution. 1 Preprint. It features reproducible and selfFigure 1: An overview of TheAgentCompany benchmark. hosted environment, simulated colleagues to test agent communication capabilities, checkpoint and execution-based evaluation, and set of 175 diverse, realistic and professional tasks in software engineering company setting. wide variety of repetitive tasks encountered in every-day workplaces, but also provide appropriate caveats about the tasks that agents cannot do. This is pressing issue, because the commercial and policy implications of diverse and effective acceleration or automation of work-related tasks will be broad, both positive (e.g. increase of quality of life and accelerated scientific discovery) and negative (e.g. potential displacement or loss of jobs and increase in wealth disparities). In this paper, we take some first steps towards resolving this gap and providing clearer view of where we are now with respect to acceleration or automation of consequential work-related tasks, and litmus test for future development in this direction. Concretely, we propose benchmark, TheAgentCompany (Figure 1) that estimates the ability of AI agents to perform tasks encountered in everyday workplaces. We create simulated software development company where agents must perform tasks related to software engineering, project management, financial analysis, and other typical tasks encountered in such business settings. The agents must browse the web, code, and interact with other simulated co-workers to achieve success on the provided tasks. TheAgentCompanys environment is based entirely on open-source software and self-hostable for reproducibility purposes, and we create rigorous evaluators that also assign partial credit when the agent gets the answer partially correct. We perform experiments using seven large language model backbones, including API-based models such as Anthropic Claude (Anthropic, 2023), OpenAI GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), Google Gemini (Team et al., 2023), Amazon Nova (Intelligence, 2024), as well as open models including Meta Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) and Alibaba Qwen (Yang et al., 2024). All models are run using the OpenHands agent framework (Wang et al., 2024b),1 which provides stable and strong agent harness for both web browsing and coding. As result of experiments, we find that the best performing model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to autonomously perform 24.0% of the provided tests to completion, and achieve score of 34.4% on our metric that provides extra credit for partially completed tasks. These results present nuanced picture of the current ability of AI agents to perform tasks. Agents powered by the current gold-standard AI techniques are able to autonomously perform wide variety of tasks encountered in everyday work. However, they are not close to automating every task encountered in workspace, even on the subset of tasks presented in TheAgentCompany, which are well-scoped administrative and coding tasks encountered in software companys day-to-day work. In the rest of this paper, we explain detail comparisons to other existing benchmarks ( 2), how we set up realistic and reproducible environments ( 3), how we define tasks ( 4) and how we create them ( 5), our baseline agent ( 6), experimental results ( 7), and finally implications and future directions ( 8). 1https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands 2 Preprint. is desktop, Table 1: Comparison of different AI agent benchmarks.

            "content": "In order to evaluate the ability of agents to perform tasks in complex real-world settings, we built TheAgentCompany with number of desiderata in mind. The comparison with several existing prominent agent benchmarks with respect to these desiderata is in Table 1. Coverage of Multiple Work-related Tasks: In order to make any valid statements about the potential of AI to accelerate or automate various types of real-world work, we should have tasks that are motivated by real-world work across multiple job categories. Many benchmarks are not relevant to real-world work (e.g. MiniWob++ (Liu et al., 2018)) or very relevant to real-world work, but only over limited scope of tasks (e.g. SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024)). In contrast, TheAgentCompany contains set of more diverse, realistic, and professional tasks that would typically be completed by multiple job roles in software engineering company. Requirement for Interaction: If agents are to integrate into real-world workplaces, they will need to communicate with the other human members of the workspace. Most other benchmarks do not measure communication or interactivity, with the exception of τ -bench (Yao et al., 2024), which only measures interaction in customer service scenarios. TheAgentCompany provides better testbed for communication as many tasks involve asking and providing information to colleagues as part of more complex task. Long-horizon Tasks with Checkpoints: In real-world settings, many tasks require taking many different steps to achieve higher-level goal. One major novel contribution of TheAgentCompany is that we both (1) contain tasks that require an agent to perform significantly more consecutive work (i.e. involving more steps and realistically taking human professionals longer to accomplish) than previous benchmarks, and (2) provide granular evaluators that measure the ability of models to perform subtasks of these larger tasks. Versatile Environment Interface: In order to handle diversity of tasks in real-world settings, we minimally should be able to interact with the tools that real-world workers use including web interfaces, programs, command-line terminals, and communication tools. TheAgentCompany covers all of these interfaces, while most previous benchmarks focus only on one or two. Preprint. Self-hosted and Reproducible: In order to allow for careful comparisons between different methods that remain constant over time, the benchmark should be fully self-hosted and reproducible. This contrasts with existing benchmarks that do not have execution environments (e.g. Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023)) or require the usage of third-party software (e.g. WorkArena (Drouin et al., 2024))."

            "title": "3 THEAGENTCOMPANY ENVIRONMENT SETUP",
            "content": "Our benchmark is set in an imaginary software engineering startup called TheAgentCompany, hence the benchmarks name. Within TheAgentCompany, we create tasks inspired by tasks handled by workers inside such companies. More details about the companys imaginary background, overview and employees can be found in Appendix A. The benchmark environment contains multiple components. Local Workspace The local workspace runs locally on the agents host, which is analogous to human professionals local workspace, e.g. their work laptop computer. This environment is created as sandboxed Docker environment to provide safe execution environment that will not affect other parts of the evaluation machine (Wang et al., 2024b).2 This environment is where agents work on the task, and within this environment the TheAgentCompany baseline agent ( 6) uses browser, code editor and Linux terminal with typical software preinstalled.3 Intranet This part of the environment mimics the companys internal websites that host code, documents, project management software, and communications software. To achieve our goal of reproducible, self-contained environment, we follow WebArena (Zhou et al., 2023), in using open-source, self-hostable software to host our environment. The environment mainly contains the following websites: 1. GitLab,4 an open-source alternative to source-code repositories such as GitHub. This is used for hosting TheAgentCompanys code repositories and tech-oriented wiki pages. 2. OwnCloud,5 an open-source alternative to office software such as Google Drive or Microsoft Office. This to save and share files, especially for document storage and collaborative editing. 3. Plane,6 an open-source alternative to task management software such as Jira or Linear. This is used to track issues, run sprints cycles, and manage product roadmaps. 4. RocketChat,7 an open-source alternative to communication software such as Slack. This is company-internal real-time messaging tool that facilitates collaboration between employees. All the websites hosted are reproducible and reset-able with mock data inspired by that from software engineering company. The data inside these company internal websites are populated with real-world software project data, as well as data manually curated by co-authors who have some experience in the relevant corporate roles. Simulated Colleague Communication One major aspect of working in company is communicating with other company members, and in TheAgentCompany we also test the ability of models to perform this type of communication. Specifically, we allow agents to use RocketChat to message other company members and obtain information that may not be available in the original task description. To create these simulated colleagues, we rely on the Sotopia platform (Zhou et al., 2024), which supports the creation of simulated human characters with LLMs. Each simulated colleague is equipped with detailed profile that includes their name, role, responsibilities, and project affiliations. 2https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/custom-sandbox-guide 3Other options would include using something like GUI-based desktop environment with office software (Xie et al., 2024), but we opt to build baseline solution that is entirely web-based, reflecting the recent trend of more enterprise software moving to the cloud. 4https://about.gitlab.com/install/ 5https://doc.owncloud.com/ 6https://github.com/makeplane/plane 7https://www.rocket.chat/install 4 Preprint.

(e.g., Sarah Johnson, who serves as the CTO, oversees technical strategy planning and R&D team leadership, with access to all technical channels). Agents can interact with these simulated colleagues through direct messages or in specific channels, as is standard in RocketChat and other platforms. By default, all simulated human characters are backed by the Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20241022 LLM across experiments, as we found that it provided the best results during preliminary experiments. For example conversations between the agent and the simulated colleagues drawn from empirical experiments, please refer to Appendix B."

            "title": "4 TASK STRUCTURE",
            "content": "The tasks in TheAgentCompany include task intent, list of checkpoints that the agent must achieve, programmatic evaluator to check success on these checkpoints, and code to initialize and finalize the environment. We show some examples in Table 2, and describe each of aspect in detail below. Task Intent Each task begins with an English description, simulating how user would instruct an LLM-based agent to perform real-world task. In general, we aim for these tasks to be clear enough so that human worker would be able to complete the task without asking for further instructions directly from the user (although they may need to ask questions of their other co-workers). Checkpoints Tasks are divided into checkpoints representing intermediate milestones, each assigned point value to measure progress. Each checkpoint is awarded certain number of points based on its significance to the overall completion of the task. Checkpoints are written in English, and typically specify one or more of the following: 5 Preprint. Action Completion: Verifying whether required actions, such as using tools, navigating to URLs, or collecting data, were carried out successfully. Data Accuracy: Evaluating the correctness and completeness of the output, such as extracted data or formatted documents. Collaboration: Assessing interactions with simulated colleagues or sharing of output, such as posting messages or asking for additional information to complete the task. Evaluators Checkpoints are created in the task design phase, but for actual evaluation, each of the checkpoints must be concretely implemented through an evaluator program that checks the completion of the checkpoint. These evaluators are implemented by examining environment states, such as the local workspace, intranet status, simulated colleague interactions, or by analyzing agent trajectories, like verifying browsing history or action sequences. In most cases, these evaluators are deterministic and written as simple Python functions. For instance, in the SWE task in Table 2, the checkpoints are deterministic: verifying if the JanusGraph repository is cloned, the binary file is built, and the server is launched with an HTTP endpoint. However, for tasks with more complex and unstructured deliverables, such as in Table 2, the last checkpoint in the Finance task requires contacting the correct finance director (David Wong) to resolve ambiguous questions, which involves judgment from (simulated) human colleague, deterministic evaluation can be challenging due to subjectivity and variability. In such cases, we employ LLM-based evaluation. This involves prompting LLMs with predefined rubrics or reference outputs to assess the agents deliverables, enabling more nuanced and flexible evaluation of these tasks. Same as the NPC backbone, all LLM-based evaluators are backed by the Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20241022."

Full completion score We define the full completion score Sfull as: Sfull = (cid:26)1 0 if all checkpoints are successfully passed, otherwise. This binary metric evaluates whether the agent successfully completed the task by passing all checkpoints. Partial completion score To provide more nuanced measure that rewards partial task completion while strongly incentivizing full task completion, we define partial completion score Spartial as: Spartial = 0."

This formulation ensures that agents are awarded partial credit in proportion to the points achieved, reflecting their progress toward task completion. At the same time, full task completion is strongly incentivized by incorporating an additional 50% credit, which is awarded only when all checkpoints are successfully completed. This design ensures that agents achieving partial progress receive scores scaled linearly with their performance, while those reaching 100% completion are distinctly rewarded to emphasize the importance of achieving the end goal. Preprint. Figure 2: Example TheAgentCompany workflow illustrating an agent managing sprint for the RisingWave project. The task involves identifying and moving unfinished issues to next sprint cycle, notifying assignees of those issues, running code coverage script, uploading summarized report to OwnCloud, and incorporating feedback on report from simulated project manager. Number of steps The number of steps is defined as the total number of LLM calls made during the task execution. This metric quantifies the operational effort required to perform the task. Cost per instance The cost per instance measures the monetary cost of querying the underlying LLM through its API to complete task. Assuming no prompt caching, the cost is calculated as: Cost = (Prompt token countPrompt token cost)+(Completion token countCompletion token cost). This efficiency metric reflects the computational expense of task completion based on token usage."

            "title": "4.2 WORKFLOW",
            "content": "Each task typically follows workflow involving the following stages: 1. Initialization: The agent sets up its workspace and prepares to execute the task. 2. Execution: The agent completes subtasks, such as navigating tools, collecting data, or processing information or if required by the task, the agent interacts with simulated colleagues or shares results via communication platforms. 3. Finalization: The agent produces and submits the final output for evaluation. Example Task We consider task designed to evaluate an agents ability to perform realistic project management workflows using multiple tools and services hosted in the benchmark. The task involves managing sprint for the RisingWave project, requiring the agent to execute interdependent steps such as sprint issue management, team communication, repository operations, and report generation while incorporating feedback from simulated project manager. The workflow as illustrated in Figure 2 begins with the agent identifying unfinished issues in the current sprint on Plane and updating their sprint assignments. This step is worth 2 points and is fully completed, earning the agent the maximum score of 2/2. Next, the agent successfully notifies the relevant assignees using Rocket.Chat regarding their pending tasks and earns 1/1 point. The agent then proceeds to clone the RisingWave repository from GitLab and execute Python script in the terminal to calculate updated code coverage. This step, worth 2 points, is only partially completed, as the agent successfully clones the repository but fails to run code coverage. As result, the agent earns 1/2 points for this checkpoint. The subsequent stepsgenerating and sharing the sprint summary report on OwnCloud and incorporating feedback from simulated project managerare not completed, resulting in 0/2 and 0/1 scores, respectively. Notably, the checkpoints can also fail if the report does not meet quality standards as assessed by the LLM-based evaluator, which evaluates the report for clarity, completeness, and successful incorporation of feedback. This ensures that the assessment reflects both the generation of outputs and their qualitative relevance to the task. 7 Preprint. Finally, the overall score is calculated using the partial completion formula defined in 4.1, where the total possible points are 8, and the awarded points sum to 4. Substituting these values, the agent achieves final score of 0.25 (25%). Our scoring mechanism thus rewards incremental progress while strongly incentivizing full completion. This example represents typical task in the TheAgentCompany benchmark, where agents are required to handle complex workflows involving multiple tools and interdependent steps. By evaluating both partial progress and overall outcomes, our benchmark provides rigorous and realistic measure of agent performance, allowing us to identify their strengths and pinpoint areas for improvement in task execution."

            "title": "5.1 CHOOSING TASK CATEGORIES",
            "content": "Many previous agent benchmarks discussed in 2 were created to evaluate agents on tasks people perform in daily life (Zhou et al., 2023; Lù et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2023), or tasks that accomplish digital chores (Yoran et al., 2024; Trivedi et al., 2024). Obtaining realistic tasks for the benchmark poses challenges. Some benchmark (Xie et al., 2024; Drouin et al., 2024; Yoran et al., 2024) crowdsourced tasks based on predetermined interfaces, platforms, and services available to the agent. They also adopt strategy to first gather task templates and then instantiate more task instances by filling in the variables. Some benchmark (Zhou et al., 2023; Koh et al., 2024; Bonatti et al., 2024) took semi-systematic approach of reviewing the action history of the research team and choosing tasks that reflected the types of task that the researchers carried out in their daily life. There are several obvious issues with this if we want to evaluate agents with broader implications in the TheAgentCompany benchmark. Despite some grounding in realistic data, the process of creating tasks from these data was susceptible to heuristic, and no consideration was made for how important or time-consuming the tasks are. The tasks are biased towards those important for academics in computer science and do not reflect the tasks performed by the entire population. In TheAgentCompany, we attempt to cover wide variety of tasks motivated by real-world work. While it is highly challenging to create representative sample of tasks, fortunately we can rely on existing resources created for other purposes as reference. Specifically, we start by referencing the 29.1 release of O*NET database (O*NET, 2024; Rounds et al., 1999), which is database of jobs performed by workers in the US created by the US Department of Labor. It also contains information about tasks performed within the context of each job, abilities required to perform each task, whether the task is major or minor task for that job category, and other pieces of relevant information. Based on this data, we first identified few categories of occupation categories to focus on. First, based on statistics from O*NET, we identified job categories that have large number of people performing this job. Then, we used median salary information for each of these job categories from the US department of labor statistics, and multiplied the number of employees in that category to estimate the aggregate value of performing this job. Based on this, we identified several categories of jobs such as General and Operations Managers, Registered Nurses, Software Developers, and Financial Managers that have both high population and high average salary. Because TheAgentCompany is designed to be non-embodied benchmark in the digital domain, we excluded the categories that require extensive physical labor such as Registered Nurses, and eventually settled on the setting of software company, which would allow us to cover tasks from the other categories."

In this setting, we attempted to create diversity of tasks, but mostly focused on concrete tasks that have well-defined goals and success criteria.

            "content": "Once we set up the environment required for our desired jobs and task categories ( 3), we return to the curated list, and perform manual curation process for tasks. For each task, this consists of the following steps: We first create description of task intent, checkpoints, and how to evaluate each checkpoint. We then identify and import the required data for the task that are currently missing in the company Intranet services and create any necessary data. We then write scripts to configure the required initialization state in the local workspace. Finally, we implement the checkpoint evaluators that calculate the scalar scores for each checkpoint. All tasks were created by coauthors of the paper. Overall, it took 20 computer science students, software engineers, and project managers over 2 months, consuming approximately 3,000 personhours in total. Some of the more complex tasks take more than 10 hours each to design, implement, test, and verify. To ensure quality control of the task creation process, we implement several check and verification processes. For each task implementation, we require screenshot proof that the evaluator is valid and that the task is able to get full score when successfully completed. We also encourage including tests for the implemented evaluator programs. Each task contribution is also code reviewed by panel of lead authors before merging into the benchmark. After creating all tasks, final round of manual human double-check of required environment data, evaluator behavior, and checkpoint scoring for every task is performed to ensure quality. Notably, during the process person who has not curated the tasks checks all the checkpoint score assignments to make sure that the importance scoring is consistent over all the tasks and that it correlates reasonably with the relative importance of the checkpoint within the task."

            "content": "To test the current state-of-the-art performance on the TheAgentCompany benchmark, we need agents that can at least perform tasks using browser, operate local workspace using terminal, and write and execute programs to perform most of the tasks. Throughout this paper, we experiment with OpenHands main agent (Wang et al., 2024b;a; Song et al., 2024), CodeAct Agent with Browsing.8 An overview of the agent architecture is illustrated in Figure 3. Interfaces The agent can interact with the environment through 3 interfaces. (1) bash shell that connects with the local workspace operating system environment for command execution. (2) Jupyter IPython server to handle interactive python (IPython) code execution requests and return the execution results back. (3) Chromium browser based on Playwright. The provider 8More specifically, version 0.14.2. Full details can be found in https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/ tree/main/openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent 9 Preprint. provides set of action primitives defined by BrowserGym (ServiceNow; Drouin et al., 2024), such as navigation, clicking, typing, and scrolling. After executing these actions, the browser runtime provides rich set of observations about the current state of the browser, including HTML, DOM, accessibility tree (Mozilla), screenshot, opened tabs, etc. These observations can be also augmented with configurable attributes that could allow agents to better understand web page observations, such as using set-of-marks on screenshot (Yang et al., 2023; He et al., 2024), visible element marking, focused element, interactable element marking, in-viewport element filtering (Zhou et al., 2023), etc. Actions The agent connects with the environment through core set of general actions. Actions IPythonRunCellAction and CmdRunAction enable the agent to execute arbitrary Python code and bash commands inside the sandbox environment (e.g., secure isolated Linux operating system used as our local workspace). BrowserInteractiveAction enables interaction with web browser with domain-specific language for browsing introduced by BrowserGym (Chezelles et al., 2024; Drouin et al., 2024). These actions provide comprehensive, yet flexible set of primitives that cover most of the tasks performed by human employees of TheAgentCompany, including navigation, click, hovering, and typing, etc. Observations Observations describe the environmental changes that the agent observes. The main types of observations used in the CodeAct agent include the execution result of bash terminal commands, Python programs, and browser actions. Specifically, the execution result of browser actions is usually browser snapshots and textual representation in the form of accessibility tree of the current browser viewport. Workflow At each step, the underlying backbone LLM will take in prompts consisting of previous agent history and the current observation of the environment, and generate response consisting of the action to execute next. On higher level, the agent can perform the task by executing code, including executing bash commands, Python code, or browser-specific programming language (defined in BrowserGym).9 This general action space allows the agent to perform various tasks, including editing files, browsing the Web, running programs, etc."

We can see that the Claude-3.5-Sonnet is the clear winner across all models. However, even with the strongest frontier model, it only manages to complete 24% of the total tasks and achieves score of 34.4% taking into account partial completion credits. Note that this result comes at cost: It requires an average of almost 30 steps and more than $6 to complete each task, making it the most expensive model to run both in time and in cost. This is expected as most of the tasks in our benchmark are of long-horizon nature. The Gemini 2.0 Flash model that comes second in terms of capability requires 40 steps on average to complete the tasks, which is time consuming, yet only to achieve less than half the success rate compared to the top-performing model. Surprisingly, its cost is less than $1, making it very cost-efficient yet relatively strong model. qualitative examination demonstrated that this was due to instances where the agent got stuck in loop or aimlessly explored the environment. Among the open-weight models, Llama 3.1 (405B) achieves the highest performance, nearly on par with OpenAIs GPT-4o model, though still having big gap behind the leading Claude 3.5 Sonnet. 9https://github.com/ServiceNow/BrowserGym/blob/main/browsergym/core/src/browsergym/core/action/ functions.py 10 Preprint.

Anecdotally, our inspection showed that GPT-4o seems to be better at giving up early, saving steps and costs if the task is clearly out of the capacity range of the agent. This suggests that open-weight models are not always the most cost-effective choice in agents given serving cost, especially with highly complex tasks. On the other hand, the newer generation of Llama model, Llama 3.3 (70B) achieves considerably high performance of 6.9% success rate, on par with the much larger (405B), older generation (Llama 3.1) model. This model also costs significantly less because of its smaller size. This suggests promising future for LLM development, as smaller and more efficient models begin to catch up in agent performance."

Table 4 presents performance breakdown on tasks that involve different platforms in TheAgentCompany. task is categorized under platform if one of the platforms that the task requires it. From Figure 4a, we can see that most models struggle with RocketChat and ownCloud. RocketChat platform is where all the social interaction with peers happens, and the low performance on this platform suggests that current-day LLMs still need improvements in communicating with others. ownCloud platform provides online Office suite functionality, and due to the complexity of the UI of web-based Office software, it is expected that current LLMs fail badly on the platform. This suggests that the browsing capability of the agents, especially on more complex websites, still needs improvement. These results underscore the inherent challenges and complexities of performing tasks that occur in real-world work environments, involve social interaction, or require understanding and navigating complex web interfaces. 11 Preprint.

How well do agents perform on different type of tasks? Table 5 presents performance breakdown on different types of tasks in TheAgentCompany. According to the nature of the task, i.e. what kind of professionals are usually assigned with the task, the tasks in TheAgentCompany can be categorized into several job departments: Software Development Engineering (SDE), Project Management (PM), Data Science (DS), Administrative (Admin), Human Resources (HR), Financial (Finance) and all the remaining (Other). From the success rate demonstrated in Figure 4b, we can see that data science, administrative, and finance tasks are among the lowest, with many LLMs completing none of the tasks successfully, and even the strongest Claude model achieving much less than the rest of the tasks. On the other hand, software engineering tasks, which may seem like much harder tasks for many humans, result in higher success rate. This suggests that there exists gap between the perceived difficulty of the tasks for humans versus the difficulty for LLM agents. For example, some tasks in the administrative and finance category involves making spreadsheets, collecting and filling in lot of information from various people, or reading and understanding images scanned by employees. These tasks are arguably easier conceptually for humans in terms of professional skill sets than software engineering, as SDE jobs usually have higher barrier of entry and more prerequisites for certain knowledge. However, most LLMs achieve much higher score on the SDE tasks. However, LLMs fail these seemingly easier tasks due to lack of ability to understand documents, communicate with other people, navigate complex software and tedious processes, and autonomously automate repetitive tasks. We hypothesize that part of the reason lies in the fact that current LLM development is heavily based on software engineering abilities, such as coding, due to several high profile benchmarks that measure this capability (e.g. HumanEval, SWE-Bench) as well as the abundance of publicly available training data related to software. On the other hand, administrative and financial tasks, are usually private data within companies, not readily available for training LLMs. 12 Preprint."

            "title": "7.3 COMMON AGENT FAILURES",
            "content": "Overall, the agent performance on TheAgentCompany is still low and majority of tasks are failed. Among those, we try to find some common and interesting agent mistakes that are often surprising because they are usually not made by humans. Lack of commonsense Some tasks are failed because the agent lacks the common sense and domain background knowledge required to infer implicit assumptions. For example, one task asked the agent to Write the responses to /workspace/answer.docx but does not explicitly states that this is Microsoft Word file. human can infer this requirement from the file extension. The agent instead treats it as plain text file, writing text directly to the file, resulting in task failure. Lack of social skills Sometimes, the agent fails to understand the implications and goals in the social conversations with colleagues in TheAgentCompany. For example, one task involves asking Alex for help, and the agent first successfully asks the right question Could you tell me who should introduce myself to next on the team? Then the simulated colleague Alex replied You should introduce yourself to Chen Xinyi next. Shes on our frontend team and would be great person to connect with! At this point, human would then talk to Chen Xinyi, but instead the agent then decides to not follow up with her, and prematurely considers the task accomplished. Incompetence in browsing Often times, the biggest obstacle in tasks is the parts that require browsing the Web. This is expected as browsing is still hard for agents given the complexity of modern-day web UIs and the numerous distractions on webpage. For example, on many tasks that involve ownCloud, the closable popup that sometimes shows up and asks the user to download the mobile phone apps for better experience has become an obstacle. Humans can simply click on the to close the popup, while the agents are stuck. Similarly, when trying to download file from ownCloud, there are several popups to click through before the actual download, and each step is error prone for agents due to the complex UI. Deceiving oneself Interestingly, we find that for some tasks, when the agent is not clear what the next steps should be, it sometimes try to be clever and create fake shortcuts that omit the hard part of task. For example, during the execution of one task, the agent cannot find the right person to ask questions on RocketChat. As result, it then decides to create shortcut solution by renaming another user to the name of the intended user."

            "title": "IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS",
            "content": "In this paper, we present TheAgentCompany, new benchmark that stands out because it specifically focuses on real-world tasks that would be tackled within the context of real-world work. Unsurprisingly, current state-of-the-art agents fail to solve majority of the tasks, suggesting that there is big gap for current AI agents to autonomously perform most of the jobs human worker would do, even in relatively simplified benchmarking setting. Looking at how different models perform on different types of tasks, we argue that tasks that involve social interaction with other humans, navigating through complex user interfaces designed for professionals, and tasks that are typically performed in private, without significant open and publicly available resources, are the most challenging. However, we believe that currently new LLMs are making significant progress: not only are they becoming more and more capable in terms of raw performance, but also more cost-efficient (e.g. Gemini 2.0 Flash). Open-weights models are closing the gap between proprietary frontier models too, and the newer models are getting smaller (e.g. Llama 3.3 70B) but with equivalent performance to previous huge models, also showcasing that efficiency will further improve. That said, this is just first step towards forming firmer grasp on how AI may affect the tasks performed within workspace, and it has its limitations. First, our tasks are generally on the more straightforward side due to the need to automatically evaluate with programs and test cases, and we do not cover more complex creative tasks such as brainstorming new product ideas or designing system architectures. Second, we are only using one agent scaffold as the baseline performance, and others may differ in performance. Third, while it would be interesting to know the actual performance of human professionals on these tasks to understand how LLM agents perform in 13 Preprint. comparison, due to resource limitations we were not able to perform this comparison in the current iteration of TheAgentCompany. Fourth, the topic and content of the tasks were mostly created through introspection by people familiar with these workspaces, which may result in some disconnect with actual tasks performed in enterprise settings. Based on this, there are many future directions for further improvement of TheAgentCompany or other related benchmarks in this space. These include further expanding the benchmark tasks to those encountered in other industries, or tasks that require physical labor. Benchmarking may also be expanded with tasks that have more vague intents to better simulate real-world scenarios where the goal is not immediately clear at the very beginning. Further, benchmarks could also be expanded to include higher-level longer-horizon tasks such as conceptualizing new product and carrying it to execution. We hope that TheAgentCompany provides first step, but not the only step, towards these goals, and that we or others may build upon the open source release of TheAgentCompany to further expand in these promising directions."

Figure 5: Simulated Colleague Communication Example 1 The agent is tasked with collecting required equipment while adhering to the departments budget. After calculating that the requested items exceed the budget, the agent negotiates with the simulated colleague to reduce the request, showcasing its ability of effective communication. 22 Preprint. Figure 6: Simulated Colleague Communication Example 2 The agent is tasked with writing job description for new graduate software engineering position. To fulfill the task, the agent communicates with simulated Project Manager to gather requirements. The agent requests the job description template, minimum and preferred qualifications, and the ideal salary range. This interaction evaluates the agents ability to gather information systematically and clarify task-related requirements through effective communication. 23 Preprint. Figure 7: Simulated Colleague Communication Example 3 - The agent is tasked with scheduling meeting between NPCs Emily Zhou and Liu Qiang based on their availability. Emily is available on Wednesday and Thursday, while Liu is only available on Thursday. The agent identifies Thursday as the common free day and successfully proposes mid-morning slot at 10:30 AM, which both participants confirm. This example highlights the agents ability to manage multi-turn conversations, effectively going back and forth between participants to align schedules and finalize meeting time."
