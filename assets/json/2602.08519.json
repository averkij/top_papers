            "title": "1 Introduction\nThe proliferation of graph-structured data across diverse domains,\nfrom billion-scale social networks and e-commerce platforms to\ncomplex protein interaction maps, has cemented the importance of\nextracting structure from unlabeled data. Attributed Graph Clus-\ntering (AGC), which aims to partition nodes into disjoint groups\nby synergizing structural topology and node attributes, stands as a\npivotal unsupervised learning task in this landscape [24]. Unlike\ntraditional community detection [31] (which ignores attributes) or\nKMeans clustering [29] (which ignores topology), AGC algorithms\nmust integrate these heterogeneous signals to uncover latent pat-\nterns. This capability makes it indispensable for industrial applica-\ntions where ground-truth labels are notoriously scarce or expensive\nto obtain, such as detecting communities in social networks [32],\nidentifying fraud rings in transaction networks [44], or segmenting\nusers for personalized recommendation [26].",
            "content": "Driven by the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [14] and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) [20], the landscape of AGC has evolved rapidly. Existing AGC methodologies can be unified under an Encode-Cluster-Optimize framework, which dissects existing algorithms into three conceptual pillars: representation learning, cluster assignment, and optimization objectives. Regarding Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yunhui Liu et al. encoders, approaches range from non-parametric spectral filters that smooth node features over the graph topology [18, 48] to parametric GNNs that fuse structure and attributes into deep latent embeddings [6, 23]. For cluster projection, strategies diverge significantly: neural centroid-based models align embeddings with learnable prototypes [22, 38], subspace methods rely on self-expressive coefficients to reveal global segmentation [7, 16], while recent community-centric approaches employ differentiable pooling layers to directly map nodes to probabilistic assignments [4, 34]. Finally, the optimization paradigms dictate how these components interact, shifting from disjoint two-stage training, where clustering is post-hoc operation (e.g., KMeans) on fixed embeddings, to endto-end joint learning that supervises representation quality with graph reconstruction [13, 38], contrastive learning [17, 21], feature decorrelation [19, 46], or clustering-specific objectives [22, 41]. Despite these algorithmic strides, chasmic gap remains between academic research and industrial reality. Through rigorous survey of existing literature, we identify that the current evaluation ecosystem for AGC is brittle, biased, and largely disconnected from the challenges of real-world deployment. We summarize the critical limitations of the current landscape as follows: The Cora-fication of Datasets: The vast majority of AGC models are evaluated almost exclusively on canonical set of small academic citation networks (e.g., Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) [2]. These datasets are characterized by small scale, textual features, and high homophily (where connected nodes share similar labels). This creates path dependency where algorithms are over-fitted to clean, academic scenarios, failing to generalize to industrial graphs (e.g., transaction or web networks) that are often largescale, heterophilous, noisy, and dominated by heterogeneous tabular features [1]. The Scalability Bottleneck: Most state-of-the-art AGC methods rely on full-batch matrix operations (e.g., constructing adjacency matrix [30, 38] or pairwise contrastive learning [17, 23]) that scale quadratically with the number of nodes. This restricts their applicability to toy graphs with few hundred thousand nodes. There is glaring absence of production-ready, minibatch compatible implementations that can handle the memory constraints of modern GPUs when processing graphs with millions of nodes. Consequently, the behavior of deep clustering on industrial-scale graphs is largely unexplored. The Supervised Metric Paradox: Although AGC is fundamentally an unsupervised task, the community defaults to supervised evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Normalized Mutual Information, and Adjusted Rand Index [24, 39]. This creates label-fitting incentive, where models are tuned to recover human-annotated classes rather than discovering intrinsic clusters themselves. In realistic industrial settings where labels are unavailable, practitioners may require algorithms that optimize intrinsic structural density or separability, yet these unsupervised quality metrics are systematically underreported [42]. The Reproducibility and Benchmarking Gap: While recent DGCBench [39] has attempted to standardize the evaluation landscape by providing unified codebase, it fails to resolve the fundamental dilemmas outlined above. It largely inherits the traditional academic evaluation paradigm, retaining full-batch training mechanisms and focusing on standard, smaller-scale datasets. Consequently, the critical \"last mile\" challenges of industrial application, specifically massive scalability via mini-batch training, robustness to feature/structure heterogeneity, and purely unsupervised structural validation, remain open problems that require dedicated, production-oriented benchmark. To bridge these gaps, we introduce comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework designed to rigorously stress-test AGC methods across diverse domains, scales, and structural properties. Our work is anchored by PyAGC, production-ready library that systematizes the chaotic landscape of clustering algorithms into unified Encode-Cluster-Optimize framework. Crucially, PyAGC is not merely research prototype; it has been battle-tested in highstakes industrial environments at Ant Group, supporting critical workflows in Fraud Detection, Anti-Money Laundering, and User Profiling. This industrial validation ensures that our benchmark addresses genuine scalability and robustness challenges. Our contributions are summarized as follows: Diverse and Challenging Data Atlas: We curate benchmark of 12 datasets ranging from 2.7 103 to 1.1 108 nodes, spanning diverse domains (citation, social, e-commerce, web). We deliberately introduce industrial datasets (e.g., HM, Pokec, WebTopic) [1] that challenge models with low homophily, tabular attributes, and massive scale, moving beyond the comfort zone of academic datasets. From Full-Graph to Production-Grade Scalability: We break the scalability barrier by providing standardized, memory-efficient mini-batch implementations for diverse AGC algorithms. We demonstrate that methods previously limited to small graphs can be scaled to 111 million nodes with promising performance, paving the way for industrial adoption. From Supervised Metric to Holistic Evaluation: We advocate for holistic evaluation protocol that prioritizes practical utility. In addition to traditional supervised metrics, we mandate the reporting of unsupervised structural metrics (Modularity [31], Conductance [15]) to assess intrinsic cluster quality in the absence of labels. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive efficiency profiling, tracking training time, inference latency, and memory consumption. Unified, Scalable, and Reproducible Framework: We release PyAGC, modular PyTorch-based library that unifies data processing, model initialization, and evaluation. Crucially, PyAGC refactors state-of-the-art AGC algorithms into efficient minibatch implementations, enabling the training of deep clustering models on graphs with over 111 million nodes in under 2 hours on single 32GB V100 GPU. By addressing these challenges, this benchmark serves as bridge between academic innovation and industrial application, setting new standard for the evaluation of Attributed Graph Clustering."

            "content": "The Representation Encoding Module (E). The encoder is responsible for fusing structural topology and node attributes into latent representation space 𝒁 R𝑁 𝐻 : 𝒁 = (𝑨, 𝑿 ; ΘE ), where ΘE denotes the learnable parameters. Existing methods diverge in their parameterization of E: Parametric Encoders: Typically instantiated as graph neural networks such as GCN [14] or GAT [35]. These models learn complex non-linear mappings by fusing topology and attributes via message passing [6, 21, 38]. (1) Non-Parametric Encoders: These involve fixed filtering operations that smooth features over the graph topology without training weights, such as low-pass graph filters or adaptive smoothing [16, 47, 48]. In this case, ΘE = . The Cluster Projection Module (C). The clusterer transforms the latent embeddings 𝒁 into cluster assignment matrix 𝑷 R𝑁 𝐾 , representing either soft probabilities or hard partitions: (2) 𝑷 = C(𝒁 ; ΘC). Based on the differentiability of this mapping, which dictates the feasibility of end-to-end optimization, we categorize clustering mechanisms into two fundamental paradigms: Differentiable Projection: This category treats clustering as differentiable layer within neural network, allowing gradients to flow from the loss back to the encoder. It encompasses discriminative approaches [4, 34] that use Softmax-activated MLPs/GNNs to output probabilities directly, and prototypical approaches [22, 38] that compute soft assignments via differentiable kernels (e.g., Students 𝑡-distribution [41]) over learnable prototypes. Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yunhui Liu et al. Discrete / Post-hoc Projection: This category applies discrete clustering algorithm to the fixed representations generated by the encoder. Since the mapping is non-differentiable, the clustering process is decoupled from representation learning. Common instantiations include KMeans [17, 21], Spectral Clustering [18, 48], and Subspace Clustering [7, 16]. The Optimization Strategy (O). The optimization strategy defines the objective function and the interaction between encoding ΘE and clustering ΘC. The general objective is formulated as: min ΘE,ΘC Ltotal = Lrep (𝑨, 𝑿, 𝒁 ) + 𝜆Lclust (𝑷, 𝑨). (3) where Lrep supervises the quality of embeddings (e.g., via graph reconstruction [11, 13] or contrastive loss [17, 21]) and Lclust enforces clustering structure (e.g., KL divergence [41], Modularity maximization [34], or Dilation+Shrink [22]). Crucially, the coordination of these components defines two distinct training paradigms: Decoupled Training: The encoder is pre-trained using only the self-supervised objective Lrep, followed by disjoint application of the post-hoc clusterer [17, 21, 25]. Joint Training: The encoder and clusterer are optimized end-toend [22, 34, 38]. The clustering objective Lclust provides supervisory signals to refine the embeddings."

            "content": "Encoders (pyagc.encoders): This module houses the representation learning backbones. We follow [28] to provide optimized implementations of standard GNNs [10, 14, 35, 36] that support both full-batch processing for small graphs and neighborsampling-based mini-batching for massive graphs. We also support graph transformers [5, 40] implemented by PyTorch Geometric [8]. This allows any clustering head to be easily paired with varying backbones without code duplication. Clusters (pyagc.clusters): We refactor clustering mechanisms into standalone Cluster Heads. Whether it is the differentiable pooling [4, 34], the prototypical assignment [22, 38], or the discrete partitioning [29], each module inherits from base class ensuring consistent input/output interfaces. This abstraction allows single encoder to be easily paired with different clustering mechanisms to isolate performance gains. Models (pyagc.models): The high-level model classes orchestrate the interaction between the encoder and the cluster head. They define the optimization strategy, managing the forward pass and the computation of joint losses (e.g., reconstruction loss + clustering loss). This design facilitates plug-and-play experimentation; for instance, swapping GCN encoder for GAT within the DAEGC framework requires changing single line in the configuration file. Unified Evaluation: PyAGC integrates data processing, metric computation, and experiment management. It provides unified data loaders and graph augmentations, alongside an optimized suite of label-based and structural metrics. All experiments are strictly configuration-driven via YAML files, decoupling hyperparameters from implementation to ensure full reproducibility and seamless transition between different graph datasets."

By utilizing neighbor sampling and subgraph-based objective approximations, PyAGC decouples GPU memory consumption from graph size.

The dataset collection is characterized by four core dimensions of diversity: Scale Diversity. Recognizing existing benchmarks often cap at 𝑁 105, our atlas spans five orders of magnitude. While we include canonical Tiny benchmarks like Cora and Photo for sanity checking, the core of our benchmark focuses on Medium to Large productionscale graphs (105 𝑁 < 107) such as Reddit and WebTopic. The collection culminates in the Massive Papers100M dataset, which contains over 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. This hierarchy serves as the ultimate stress test for mini-batching strategies, allowing us to evaluate the transition from memory-intensive full-batch methods to industrial-grade scalable implementations. Attribute Diversity. critical gap in existing AGC research is the over-reliance on textual graphs, where features are clean bag-ofwords or sentence embeddings. However, industrial nodes are frequently described by tabular metadata consisting of heterogeneous categorical and numerical features. Our benchmark introduces tabular graphs HM, Pokec, and WebTopic [1]. These present unique challenge as tabular distributions are often skewed, multi-modal, and noise-heavy. Unlike textual graphs where language models provide common latent space, tabular graphs require models to handle arbitrary feature types and distributions, reflecting the true complexity of real-world tabular metadata (e.g., user demographics and transaction counts). Structural Diversity. While classical benchmark datasets provide essential environments for method testing, industrial graphs often exhibit distinct topological profiles that extend the requirements for model robustness. Our atlas captures broad homophily-heterophily spectrum: while classic datasets often display high homophily (e.g., Physics, edge homophily H𝑒 = 0.93), industrial graphs like HM and WebTopic are characterized by heterophilous patterns (H𝑒 < 0.25), where edges frequently bridge nodes from different latent clusters. Furthermore, we account for varying levels of structural density; the benchmark spans from sparse citation graphs (e.g., ArXiv, Avg. Deg. 6.9) to the dense, high-order connectivity found in co-purchase networks (e.g., HM, Avg. Deg. 460.9). These diverse structural regimes ensure that AGC models are tested for their ability to combat oversmoothing in sparse, homophilous settings while effectively identifying latent structures in dense, heterophilous, and potentially noisy industrial topologies. Domain Diversity. By integrating industrial data, we extend the evaluation domain from narrow Citation and Co-author networks to E-commerce (Products, HM), Social Networks (Reddit, Pokec, Flickr), and the Web Graph (WebTopic). This ensures that the discovered insights are not domain-specific but are generalizable to the broader ecosystem of graph machine learning applications where ground-truth clusters are intrinsically tied to specific industrial behaviors like fraud, co-purchasing, or user navigation. GAE [13], DGI [37], CCASSG [46], S3GC [6], NS4GC [17] and MAGI [21]; 4) Deep Joint Methods: DAEGC [38], DinkNet [22], MinCut [3], DMoN [34], and Neuromap [4]. Table 5 provides detailed classification of these methods within the ECO framework, while more detailed descriptions are presented in Appendix B.

For Medium, Large, and Massive datasets, standard implementations result in Out-Of-Memory errors.

            "content": "Hardware Environment. To ensure fair comparisons and demonstrate the accessibility of our benchmark to standard research laboratories, all experiments are conducted on Linux workstation equipped with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8163 CPU @ 2.50GHz, 480GB RAM, and single NVIDIA Tesla V100 (32GB) GPU. By restricting evaluation to single GPU, we stress-test the memory efficiency of the proposed mini-batch implementations, verifying that our scalable solutions are relevant to standard industrial and academic settings without reliance on massive multi-GPU clusters. Training Protocol. All deep learning methods are optimized using the Adam optimizer. To ensure statistical reliability and mitigate the impact of random initialization, we report the mean and standard deviation of all metrics across 5 independent runs with different random seeds. Regarding the massive Papers100M dataset, due to its prohibitive computational cost, we restrict the training of deep methods to single epoch. For all other datasets, models are trained until convergence or for fixed number of epochs. Reproducibility and Hyperparameters. To resolve the reproducibility crisis often observed in clustering research, we do not hard-code parameters. Instead, all specific hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, encoder depth, hidden dimensions) are strictly managed via configuration files (YAML) located in each methods directory (e.g., benchmark/DMoN/train.conf.yaml). The code and resources are publicly available via GitHub, PyPI, and Docs."

A compara-\ntive analysis reveals a stark dichotomy between performance on\ntraditional academic datasets and industrial-scale graphs.",
            "content": "The \"Cora\" Comfort Zone. On classic small-scale, high-homophily datasets (Cora, Photo, Physics), most methods achieve high performance. For instance, on Photo, simple baselines like Node2Vec and sophisticated methods like NS4GC both achieve NMI scores > 65%. This confirms that in clean, homophilous environments, structure and attributes are highly correlated, making the clustering task relatively trivial. Collapse on Industrial Graphs. Performance degrades largely when moving to industrial environments (HM, Pokec, WebTopic). On Pokec (a large social network), the best performing method (SAGSC) only achieves an NMI of 38.33%, while most deep learning methods (e.g., DAEGC, DGI) fail to surpass 5% NMI. This collapse is attributed to two factors: (1) Heterophily and Noise: Industrial graphs like HM (H𝑒 = 0.16) are highly heterophilous. Methods relying on GNN encoders tend to over-smooth features across class boundaries, rendering the learned embeddings indistinguishable. (2) Tabular Complexity: Unlike the clean text features, the tabular features contain heterogeneous distributions and noise. Traditional KMeans and spectral filtering methods struggle to capture the complex dependencies in this feature space without learnable non-linear transformations. Robustness of Deep Decoupled Methods. Among the evaluated categories, Deep Decoupled methods (e.g., NS4GC, MAGI, S3GC) demonstrate the most consistent robustness. By separating representation learning from clustering, these methods benefit from stable self-supervised pre-training, avoiding the clustering collapse phenomenon often observed in joint training (where the clusterer forces the encoder into trivial solution).

Table 2\n(Modularity and Conductance) highlights the disconnect between\nstructural quality and label alignment.",
            "content": "Structure vs. Semantics Misalignment. We observe instances where supervised metrics and structural metrics diverge. For example, on Products, SAGSC achieves the highest Modularity (84.56%) and lowest Conductance (12.62%), indicating it finds extremely dense, well-separated communities. However, its NMI (51.78%) is lower than NS4GC (54.63%). This highlights critical nuance: ground-truth labels do not always reflect topological communities. In practical applications like fraud detection, partition with high modularity (isolating dense cliques) may be more valuable than one aligning with broad semantic labels. Failure Modes in Heterophily. On the highly heterophilous HM dataset (H𝑒 = 0.16), standard GNN methods yield low or even negative Modularity scores, implying they fail to detect non-trivial community structures. Interestingly, DMoN, which directly optimizes spectral modularity objective, achieves the highest structural quality (Q = 12.54%), despite having mediocre supervised scores. This underscores the necessity of including structural metrics in evaluation; relying solely on Accuracy would mask DMoNs utility in detecting latent structure in label-poor environments."

            "content": "Breaking the Memory Wall. Standard implementations of methods like DAEGC or NS4GC typically scale quadratically or require the full adjacency matrix, making them infeasible for graphs larger than Physics. Our mini-batch implementations clamp GPU memory usage effectively. As shown in Table 3, training NS4GC on Papers100M consumes only 14GB of GPU memory, well within the limits of standard V100 (32GB), whereas the full-batch equivalent would require terabytes of RAM. Training Throughput. PyAGC achieves production-grade throughput. We successfully train deep clustering models on Papers100M (111M nodes) in remarkably short windows: GAE completes an epoch in 0.67 hours, and contrastive methods like NS4GC take 1.24 hours. This proves that deep graph clustering is no longer limited to toy datasets and is ready for high-frequency industrial retraining cycles. Among deep joint methods, DMoN and Neuromap are particularly efficient due to their compact matrix formulations, processing WebTopic in under 7 minutes. Trade-offs. Non-parametric methods like MS2CAG are extremely fast on medium datasets (0.16 min on Reddit) but hit hard scalability wall on Massive graphs. Conversely, deep mini-batch methods incur time overhead due to sampling and data loading but offer linear scalability to virtually infinite graph sizes. This distinction allows practitioners to choose the right tool: non-parametric solvers for rapid prototyping on medium graphs, and PyAGC mini-batch deep models for massive-scale deployment."

To comprehensively evaluate AGC algorithms, we selected datasets spanning diverse domains (Citation, Co-purchase, Social, Web) and feature modalities (Textual, Tabular). The datasets are categorized by scale, corresponding to the taxonomy presented in Table 4. A.1 Tiny Scale Datasets (𝑁 < 104) Cora [14]. This is standard citation network frequently used in graph clustering literature. Nodes represent machine learning papers, and edges represent citation links. The node attributes are sparse bag-of-words vectors indicating the presence of specific keywords in the paper. The clustering task involves grouping papers into seven distinct research topics. Photo [33]. segment of the Amazon co-purchase graph. Nodes represent goods (photo), and edges connect two products if they are frequently bought together. Node features are bag-of-words vectors extracted from product reviews. The goal is to cluster products into eight categories based on the product type. A.2 Small Scale Datasets (104 𝑁 < 105) Physics [33]. This is co-authorship graph constructed from the Microsoft Academic Graph. Nodes are authors, and edges are established if two authors have co-authored paper. Node features are bag-of-words representations of paper keywords. The authors are clustered into five research fields. HM [1]. This dataset is derived from the H&M Kaggle competition. The graph represents co-purchasing network where nodes are products, and undirected edges connect products that are frequently bought by the same customers.

The task is to partition products into 21 distinct product categories. Flickr [45]. An image-sharing social network dataset. Nodes represent images uploaded to Flickr, and edges reflect common metadata (e.g., same location, same gallery, or shared by the same user). Node features are 500-dimensional bag-of-words vectors based on userprovided tags. The clustering target is to group images into seven classes based on their tags. A.3 Medium Scale Datasets (105 𝑁 < 106) ArXiv [12]. citation network representing Computer Science papers in arXiv. Nodes represent papers, and edges represent citations.

This dataset is constructed from Reddit posts made in the month of September 2014. Each node represents post, and the ground-truth labels represent the community (subreddit) that the post belongs to. Nodes are connected based on common users commenting on both posts. Node features are 300-dimensional GloVe word vectors averaged over the content associated with the posts, including the title, comments, score, and number of comments. MAG [12]. Extracted from the Microsoft Academic Graph, this is heterogeneous network containing papers, authors, institutions, and fields of study. For the purpose of this benchmark, we utilize the homogeneous subgraph of papers connected by citation links. The node features are 128-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings of paper abstracts. The clustering task involves distinguishing between 349 venue categories (journals or conferences). A.4 Large Scale Datasets (106 𝑁 < 108) Pokec [1]. Based on data from the popular social network in Pokec. Nodes represent users, and directed edges connect users who have marked others as friends. The node features are tabular and derived from user profile information, including numerical features (e.g., profile completion proportion) and categorical indicators (e.g., whether specific profile fields are filled). The task is to predict which region user belongs to, presenting an extreme multi-class clustering challenge with 183 classes and moderate heterophily. Products [12]. large-scale co-purchase network from Amazon. Nodes represent products, and edges connect products that are purchased together. Node features are generated from the product descriptions using dimensionality-reduced bag-of-words approach. The clustering task is to group products into 47 top-level categories. WebTopic [1]. This dataset represents segment of the Internet (Web Graph) obtained from the Yandex search engine. Nodes are websites, and directed edges exist if user followed link from one website to another within selected period. The features are tabular and highly heterogeneous, including numerical features (e.g., number of videos on the site) and categorical features (e.g., the websites zone, free hosting status). The goal is to cluster websites into 28 topics. This dataset is notable for its low homophily and complex feature distribution. A.5 Massive Scale Datasets (𝑁 > 108) Papers100M [12]. Currently one of the largest public graph benchmarks available. It is citation network of approximately 111 million papers indexed by MAG. Directed edges represent citations. Node features are 128-dimensional embeddings averaged from the word embeddings of titles and abstracts. The task is to cluster papers into 172 subject areas. Note that approximately 1.5 million of nodes are labeled with one of arXivs subject areas.

To facilitate systematic comparison, we categorize these methods based on the Encode-Cluster-Optimize framework introduced in Section 2. B.1 Traditional and Non-Parametric Methods These methods typically employ fixed or simplified encoding mechanisms and decouple the clustering process from representation learning. Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yunhui Liu et al. Node Similarity Matrix which guides the representation learning. The method aligns node neighbors and performs semantic-aware sparsification to ensure the learned embeddings preserve intrinsic semantic structures suited for clustering. MAGI [21]: MAGI bridges the gap between community detection and contrastive learning. It uses modularity maximization as pretext task. Positive and negative pairs are defined not by random corruption, but by modularity-based communities, effectively using the GNN to maximize the modularity of the resulting partitions. This aligns the representation learning objective directly with the clustering goal. B.3 Deep Joint Methods These methods optimize the encoder and the cluster assignments simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion. DAEGC [38]: DAEGC employs Graph Attention Network as the encoder to capture neighbor importance. It combines reconstruction loss with clustering guidance loss (KL divergence between soft assignments and target distribution). The selftraining process iteratively refines the clusters and the embeddings. DinkNet [22]: DinkNet is designed explicitly for scalability. It replaces the traditional KL-divergence loss with Dilation (separating different clusters) and Shrink (compacting same-cluster nodes) loss. It initializes cluster centers as learnable parameters and uses an adversarial mechanism to optimize the distribution. MinCut [3]: This method provides continuous relaxation of the normalized min-cut problem. GNN projects nodes directly into soft cluster assignment matrix. The loss function minimizes the cut value (edge connections between clusters) while enforcing orthogonality to prevent trivial solutions (all nodes in one cluster). DMoN [34]: DMoN optimizes the spectral modularity objective. It essentially acts as differentiable pooling operator that coarsens the graph. Unlike MinCut, it does not require orthogonality constraints because the modularity metric naturally penalizes trivial partitions. Neuromap [4]: Neuromap creates differentiable formulation of the Map Equation, an information-theoretic measure for community detection based on flow dynamics. It optimizes the code length required to describe random walks on the graph, naturally balancing cluster internal density with external separation without requiring pre-specified number of clusters, though we fix 𝐾 for consistent benchmarking. KMeans [29] & Node2Vec [9]: We include these as fundamental representatives to assess the value of attribute-structure fusion. KMeans clusters raw node features (ignoring topology), while Node2Vec clusters structural embeddings learned via random walks (ignoring attributes). SSGC [49]: SSGC addresses the over-smoothing and scalability issues of deep GCNs. It utilizes modified Markov Diffusion Kernel to derive spectral graph convolution that balances lowand high-pass filter bands. In our framework, SSGC acts as non-parametric encoder that aggregates features over multiple hops in single step, followed by standard KMeans clustering. Its linearity allows for efficient processing, though it lacks the expressivity of deep non-linear encoders. SAGSC [7]: SAGSC combines Laplacian smoothing with subspace clustering. It first smooths attributes over the graph to incorporate structural information. It then employs self-expressive subspace clustering procedure that learns factored coefficient matrix, projecting factors into new space to generate valid affinity matrix for spectral clustering. This method represents hybrid approach where the encoding is fixed smoothing operation, and the optimization targets self-expressiveness. MS2CAG [16]: MS2CAG improves upon subspace graph clustering by formulating rank-constrained SVD problem. It introduces linear-time optimization solver that avoids the explicit construction of the 𝑁 𝑁 self-expressive matrix, which is common bottleneck in subspace clustering. Theoretical analysis links its objective to modularity maximization. B.2 Deep Decoupled Methods These methods utilize parametric Graph Neural Networks to learn node embeddings via self-supervised tasks, followed by post-hoc application of discrete clusterer (typically KMeans). GAE [13]: foundational generative method that uses GNN encoder to parameterize the latent distribution of node embeddings. The objective is to reconstruct the adjacency matrix via decoder. Clustering is performed on the learned representations. DGI [37]: DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between local node patches and global graph summary vector. It learns representations by contrasting true graph patches with corrupted counterparts (negative sampling). This contrastive objective encourages the encoder to capture global structural properties without explicit reconstruction. CCASSG [46]: Unlike contrastive methods requiring negative pairs, CCASSG optimizes feature-level objective inspired by Canonical Correlation Analysis. It generates two views via augmentation and minimizes the correlation between different feature dimensions while maximizing invariance across views. This decorrelation prevents collapse and removes the need for costly negative sampling. S3GC [6]: S3GC utilizes contrastive learning framework specifically designed to enhance clusterability. It employs random walks to define positive neighborhoods and optimizes contrastive loss that sharpens the decision boundaries between potential clusters. It effectively scales to massive-scale datasets. NS4GC [17]: NS4GC argues that standard contrastive learning may neglect semantic node relations. It introduces Reliable Bridging Academia and Industry: Comprehensive Benchmark for Attributed Graph Clustering Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Table 6: Clustering performance comparison measured by ARI and F1 (%) (Mean SD). The best and second-best results are highlighted. \"\" denotes OOM errors as these methods strictly require full-graph processing."
