This benchmark holds significant importance for accelerating the discovery of superconducting materials using AI-based methods. Keywords: Benchmark, Superconductors, Artificial Intelligence Introduction. Superconducting materials, characterized by their exceptional property of zero electrical resistance, have remained central research focus in condensed matter physics since their discovery in 1911 (when mercury exhibited superconductivity at 4.2 [1]). As evidenced by the arXiv [2] preprint repository, scholarly publications containing the keyword Superconductivity have now surpassed 60,000 entries to date, underscoring the sustained scientific significance of this field. High-temperature superconducting materials serve as key components for energy-efficient transmission [3], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [4], nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [5], and fusion devices [6]. Therefore, the discovery of new high-temperature, or even roomtemperature, superconductors holds great significance for human production and daily life. With technological advancements, AI has become an essential tool for discovering superconducting materials [7]. Kamal Choudhary et al. [8] performed largescale calculations on crystal materials databaszes based on atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN) [9] predictions and identified 105 dynamically stable superconductors with Tc > 5 K. Similarly, Miguel A. L. Marques et al. [10] applied this approach to hydrogen-based systems and discovered 59 superconducting materials, among which Li2CuH6 exhibits superconducting tranzfgao@ruc.edu.cn sition temperature of 86 K. InvDesFlow [11] explored new chemical spaces through crystal generative model, demonstrating the feasibility of generative models in superconducting material discovery. In its latest application, InvDesFlow identified Li2AuH6 [12] with superconducting transition temperature of 140 K, which significantly exceeds the McMillan limit and even surpasses the liquid nitrogen temperature regime. Recently, numerous AI tools have been employed to predict superconducting transition temperatures. The ALIGNN model has achieved mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 2 in its predictions [8]. The bootstrapped ensemble of tempered equivariant graph neural networks (BETE-NET) [13] predicts Tc using three moments (λ, ω, and ω2) of the spectral function α2F (ω), reducing the MAE to 2.1 K. The BANS [14] model, based on deep learning framework that incorporates 3d vision transformer (3D-ViT) architecture and attention mechanisms, predicts Tc by analyzing electronic band structures. For systems with Tc < 10 K, the prediction error is less than 2 K, while for high-Tc superconductors, the error remains below 25 K. The InvDesFlow-AL [15] proposes the SuperconGNN model, which employs an equivariant graph neural network based on spherical harmonics to predict superconducting transition temperatures. This framework achieves prediction accuracy of less than 2 for conventional BCS superconductors as well. However, these models lack unified standard for evaluating their performance. Developing standard5 2 0 2 ] - s . - c [ 1 7 3 8 3 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r ized benchmarks is crucial for the advancement of algorithms. For example, in protein structure prediction, the PoseBusters benchmark introduced by AlphaFold3 [16] has been widely adopted for assessing various AI tools. In this work, we compile superconducting materials newly reported during the 20242025 period, including X2YH6 systems, perovskite-type MXH3 structures, fluorite-type M3XH8 compounds, cage-like BCN-based materials evolved from the LaH10 structure with metal atom doping, and two-dimensional honeycomb structures derived from MgB2. Additionally, we highlight several approaches based on physical intuition for the inverse design of high-Tc superconductors. retrospective analysis of these strategies offers valuable insights for future efforts in discovering materials with even higher superconducting transition temperatures. Methods. In this section, we present the establishment process of HTSC-2025, the testing methodology for AI algorithms on this benchmark, and the validation procedures for AI-discovered novel materials. As illustrated in Figure 1(a), our construction process initiates with an extensive literature review of theoretically predicted superconductors. Considering the essential requirements of timeliness, high application value, and rapid validation for benchmark systems, we specifically focus on high-temperature superconducting materials discovered since 2024 that exhibit ambientpressure superconductivity. To enable efficient verification of AI performance, we prioritize materials identified through BCS superconducting mechanisms, as this selection ensures that AI predictions can be rapidly validated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Subsequently, we systematically collect crystal structure information (CIF files) and corresponding theoretically predicted superconducting transition temperatures through multiple approaches: expert manual construction, automated script replacement, and direct communication with original authors via email. Finally, through systematic literature analysis, we categorize these materials into specific crystalline systems: X2YH6-type structures, perovskite MXH3-type structures, M3XH8-type structures, LaH8-type clathrates, MgB2-like 2D honeycomb lattices, and other structures, thereby establishing structured framework for subsequent AI performance evaluation. As illustrated in Figure 1(b), prior to evaluating AI models on the HTSC-2025 benchmark, the training dataset must rigorously exclude these materials to prevent data leakage. The AI models then convert crystal data into graph representations or other structured formats for input, subsequently predicting the superconducting Tc of the materials. To quantify predictive performance, we calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) between model predictions and DFT-computed For comprehensive evaluation, the test set results. is partitioned according to the aforementioned crystalline systems (X2YH6, MXH3, etc.), enabling both system-specific MAE calculations and total MAE. Fur2 thermore, given the greater application value of hightemperature superconductors compared to their lowtemperature counterparts, we introduce an additional evaluation metric: the prediction success rate across different critical temperature intervals. This stratified analysis aims to quantify the performance of AI in identifying materials within specific Tc ranges, with particular focus on technologically critical regimes such as the McMillan limit and the liquid nitrogen temperature range. As shown in Figure 1 (c), the performance of AI models is often further validated by their ability to discover new high-temperature superconducting materials. For AI-recommended candidate superconductors, the BCS theory provides convenient framework for verification using first-principles methods, such as those implemented in VASP [17] and Quantum Espresso [18]. According to BCS theory, superconductivity arises from the formation of cooper pairselectron pairs bound via phononmediated interactions that overcome coulomb repulsion. The collective condensation of these cooper pairs near the fermi surface opens superconducting energy gap, resulting in the characteristic zero-resistance state. To verify whether candidate material follows the BCS superconducting mechanism, systematic first-principles computational protocol is employed, including crystal structure optimization, phonon spectrum analysis, and electronphonon coupling calculations. Results. In this section, we analyze the ambientpressure superconducting materials and their mechanisms within HTCS-2025. Notably, the HTCS-2025 excludes comprehensive literature-reported materials, retaining only representative candidates. This selective curation enhances AI model training by ensuring exposure to related superconducting materials (outside HTCS2025), thereby improving generalization performance. Figure 2(a) presents histogram of the Tc distribution, where the vertical axis indicates the number of materials within each Tc interval. The HTCS-2025 dataset contains total of 140 samples, with an average Tc of 27.3 K. Notably, more than half of the crystals exhibit Tc exceeding 20 K, highlighting the datasets focus on evaluating materials with relatively high Tc values. Figure 2(b) shows heatmap overlaid on the periodic table, in which the color intensity represents the frequency of each element appearing in HTCS-2025. Hydrogen is the most frequently occurring element, present in 79 compounds, underscoring the significant potential of hydrides in achieving high-temperature superconductivity. Figure 2(c) illustrates representative materials from different material systems. Table presents the average Tc, maximum Tc, corresponding chemical formula, space group, and the number of materials for each material system. As illustrated in Figure 2 (c), the discovery of Mg2IrH6 (Tc = 160 K) [19] has inspired researchers to conduct more detailed investigations into X2YH6 systems. Many systems with superconducting Tc exceeding 20 Kand even reaching up to 70 Khave been discovered. Notable examples include Li2CuH6 (Tc = 86 K), Mg2PtH6 3 FIG. 1.

(Tc = 78 K), Mg2PdH6 (Tc = 63 K), Mg2RhH6 (Tc = 53 K) [10], as well as the recently AI-discovered Li2AuH6 (Tc = 140 K) [12]. The superconducting mechanisms of these structures appear to be similar. The electronic structure of X2YH6 compounds reveals the presence of van hove singularities near the fermi level, which may contribute to their high Tc. In addition, the significant contribution of hydrogen 1s orbitals to the electronic density of states enables strong coupling between high-frequency phonon modes and electrons near the fermi level, thereby enhancing the overall electronphonon coupling strength. Inspired by studies on X2YH6 compounds, fluoritetype M3XH8 compounds (Figure 2 (c)) with the m3m space group, where = Li, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Ga, Rb, Sr, and In, and denotes 3d, 4d, or 5d transition metals, have also attracted considerable attention. total of 29 dynamically stable compounds have been identified. The band structure of Mg3OsH8 (Tc = 73 K) [20] shows three bands crossing the fermi level, indicating its metallic nature. The electronic density of states of hydrogen is uniformly distributed near the fermi level, facilitating electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, the significant phonon density of states contribution from hydrogen atoms in the high-frequency phonon region further enhances this coupling. The high-throughput computational discovery of ZnHCr3 (Tc = 30 K), ZnHAl3 (Tc = 80 K) [21], and MgHCu3 (Tc = 42 K) [22] has sparked increasing interest in the superconducting properties of cubic perovskite MXH3 systems [23]. Miguel A. L. Marques et al. have also identified series of superconducting materials [10, 24, 25] within the MXH3 family, such as KInH3 (Tc = 73 K), KAlH3 (Tc = 52 K), AlHgH3 (Tc = 28 K), PbHgH3 (Tc = 25 K), KCaH3 (Tc = 23 K), and PbOsH3 (Tc = 23 K). Recently, Bin Li et al. systematically explored perovskite hydrides by selecting alkali and posttransition metals as the M-site elements and 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals as the X-site elements. Through high-throughput calculations, they identified 17 dynamically stable perovskite hydrides [26]. Notably, SrAuH3 (Tc = 132 K) and SrZnH3 (Tc = 107 K) exhibit exceptionally high superconducting transition temperatures, highlighting the great potential of this family of materials for achieving high-Tc superconductivity. Multiple electronic bands cross the fermi level. The 5d orbitals of Au contribute significantly near the fermi level, forming 4 FIG. 2.

(c) Representative high-Tc materials from different material systems. pronounced van hove singularity, which may enhance the density of states at the fermi level and thereby promote superconductivity. More recently, additional superconducting materials within this system have continued to be discovered [27], such as KScH3 (Tc = 40 K), RbScH3 (Tc = 32 K), and CsScH3 (Tc = 18 K). The dynamical stability of cage-like hydrides such as CaH6 [28, 29], YH6 [30, 31], CeH10 [32], and LaH10 [33, 34] requires high-pressure conditions, which limits their synthesis and practical applications. However, the conventional superconducting mechanisms observed in these materials have inspired physicists to explore the possibility of achieving high-temperature superconductivity within BCS-type materials. Given that and are the lightest elements capable of forming strong covalent bonds, and considering the compositional diversity of guest metal atoms, significant progress has been made in substituting hydrogen in cage-like hydride structures with these elements. The hexagonal cage-structured XB8C compounds (X = Ca, Sr, Ba) exhibit superconductivity with Tc=77.1, 64.4, and 53.2 K, respectively [35]. First-principles calculations reveal metallic ground state characterized by multiple bands crossing the fermi level. The coexistence of flat and dispersive bands near fermi level leads to an enhanced electronphonon coupling strength, providing mechanism for the observed elevated Tc values. Phonon spectrum calculations show that the electron-phonon coupling is mainly concentrated in the high-frequency optical modes. La(BN)5 and Y(BN)5 [36] adopt cage-like crystal structures analogous to that of LaH10, in which boron and nitrogen atoms substitute for hydrogen to reduce the high pressure typically required for maintaining dynamical stability. Their superconducting transition temperatures are 69 and 59 K, respectively. similar structure, AlB6N6, exhibits predicted Tc of 47 [37]. Quaternary superconductors, including RbBaB6C6 (Tc = 68 K) [38] and KPbB6C6 (Tc = 88 K) [39], exhibit crystal structures primarily composed of covalent BC framework, with metal atoms doped as guest species. By doping metals into the boron-nitride cage (BN)5, four stable superconductors M(BN)5 (M = Na, Al, In, Tl) are obtained, with corresponding Tc of 8 K, 22 K, 15 K, and 15 K, respectively. The electronic band structure of Al(BN)5 [40] reveals multiple bands crossing the fermi level, giving rise to both electron-type and hole-type fermi surfaces. The electronic states at the fermi surface are primarily derived from the orbitals of and atoms, as well as the orbitals of the Al atom, which is favorable for Cooper pair formation and enhances electronphonon coupling. Atomic doping is an effective approach to enhance the superconducting transition temperature. The transition from insulator to metal and the induction of high-temperature superconductivity are achieved by doping guest atoms (such as Li and Mg) into zinc blende-type structures (XY4Z4, where Y4Z4 = B4N4, Si4C4, B4P4) [41]. Notably, LiB4N4 and MgB4P4 exhibit superconducting transition temperatures as high as 67 and 45 K, respectively, surpassing that of the conventional high-temperature superconductor MgB2. The elevated Tc values in these compounds are attributed to high electronic density of states at the fermi level and the softening of low-frequency acoustic phonon modes, which significantly enhance the electron-phonon coupling strength. By introducing potassium atoms into the metal borohydride Ca(BH4)2, strong electron-phonon coupling between BH σ molecular orbitals and bond-stretching phonon modes can be achieved. At doping concentration of 0.10, the transition temperature reaches maximum value of 130 [42]. In addition to the material systems mentioned above, we also observe progress in physics-inspired strategies for discovering high-temperature superconductors, such as hole doping, introducing light elements to form strong covalent bonds, and tuning spinorbit coupling. The compound (BN)5 exhibits insulating behavior in its pristine state. However, hole doping induces downward shift of the fermi level, leading to the metallization of the sp3 hybridized σ-bonding band. This electronic transition is accompanied by the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity with Tc reaching 96 [43]. With increasing hole concentration, although the overall electronic structure remains largely unchanged, strong coupling arises between mid-frequency optical phonon modes and the σ-electrons, contributing significantly to the total electronphonon coupling. At ambient pressure, MgB2C2 and hole-doped NaBC exhibit potential for high-temperature superconductivity [44]. The hole concentration can be tuned via thermal deintercalation methods. For instance, low-temperature sodium deintercalation in NaBC effectively suppresses the formation of defects in BC layers and preserves strong electron-phonon coupling. The deintercalated layered structures (e.g., Na3/4BC and Mg2/3B2C2) remain stable under kinetic constraints, and the planarity of the BC layers is crucial to superconductivity. Excessive buckling, such as in Na2/3BC where davg = 0.12 A, disrupts the coupling between σ-band electrons and high-frequency bond-stretching phonons (65 meV), significantly reducing the Tc. These hole-doped materials exhibit strong electron-phonon coupling strengths (λ 0.951.32) and characteristic two-gap superconducting behavior similar to MgB2, with Tc values ranging from 43 to 88 K, the highest being observed in Na7/8BC. The two-dimensional honeycomb structure KB2C2 (Tc = 153 K) [45] is designed based on the AlB2-type structure of MgB2 [46]. By introducing carbon atoms to form strong covalent B-C σ bonds, strong coupling between electrons and high-frequency in-plane phonon vibrations is achieved. Its multigap nature (coexistence of σ and π states) further facilitates cooper pair formation. Biaxial tensile strain induces phonon mode softening and significantly enhances the electron-phonon coupling constant λ, far exceeding that of conventional two-dimensional su5 perconductors. Similarly, by replacing the BB surface layer of MgB2 with BC layer, the two-dimensional material Mg2B4C2 exhibits high-temperature superconductivity, with predicted Tc estimated to be around 4748 [47]. At ambient pressure, I4mm-Mg2BN, Cm-Mg2BN, Cmmm-MgB2N, and R3m-Mg2BN exhibit superconducting transition temperatures Tc of 31 K, 19 K, 11 K, and 4.5 [48], respectively. The low-frequency lattice vibrations primarily contributed by Mg and atoms play dominant role in electron-phonon coupling, serving as key factor for superconductivity. Among these phases, I4mm-Mg2BN exhibits the strongest EPC (λ = 1.33), corresponding to its highest Tc (31 K), whereas R3mMg2BN shows the weakest EPC (λ = 0.38). The kagome metals Rh3M2S2 (M = Pb, In, Tl) exhibit the coexistence of superconductivity and topological states [49]. These materials are weak superconductors, with superconducting transition temperatures Tc of 1.03 (Pb), 2.31 (In), and 5.39 (Tl), respectively. Notably, spin-orbit coupling has significant influence on Tc. Discussion and Conclusion. Most of AI-based studies on superconducting Tc prediction have claimed significant improvements in accuracy [8, 1315]. However, the field still lacks unified, open, and extensible benchmark, which hinders fair comparisons between models and limits further development. In this work, we propose HTSC2025, benchmark dataset for high-Tc superconductors under ambient pressure. It features timely coverage (materials predicted from 2023 to May 2025), practical value (ambient pressure and high Tc focus), quick verifiability (compatible with BCS theory and DFT), and broad scope (including X2YH6, perovskite-type MXH3, M3XH8 systems, etc.). We also review series of physically inspired design strategies, highlighting that hole doping, the introduction of light atoms forming strong covalent bonds, and spin-orbit coupling engineering can enhance Tc. HTSC-2025 is publicly released and will be continuously maintained. It provides reproducible and quantitative basis for cross-model evaluation and offers physically interpretable templates to support inverse design and the discovery of new high-Tc superconductors. Recently, AI has driven significant progress in the discovery of high-pressure superconductors. For example, Jiang et al. [50] developed Tc prediction model under high pressure and identified 14 new clathrate hydride prototypes. Among them, 11 ternary clathrate structures were predicted to exhibit Tc values above 250 at 300 GPa, with Li2NaH17 and ThY2H24 approaching room-temperature Tc (297 and 303 K, respectively) at lower pressures. Wang et al. [51] also identified 144 high-pressure superconductors using AI tools. However, HTSC-2025 does not include these materials. This reflects balance between practical and academic value: while high-pressure superconductors offer insights into achieving room-temperature Tc, their extreme pressure conditions limit real-world applications.
