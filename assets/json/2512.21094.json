            "content": "Generative AI has witnessed paradigm shift from unimodal synthesis to cohesive multimodal content creation (Singer et al., 2023; Ho et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025a; Tang et al., 2025), with Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation emerging as frontier that unifies visual dynamics and auditory realism. Recent breakthroughs, from proprietary systems like Sora (OpenAI, 2024) and Veo (DeepMind, 2024) to open research efforts (Yang et al., 2024; Ruan et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024), have demonstrated the ability to generate high-fidelity audio-video pairs from textual prompts. Despite this rapid progress, the evaluation of T2AV systems remains fundamentally underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks largely evolve from unimodal or weakly multimodal settings. On the one hand, existing benchmarks either prioritize visual quality in isolation (e.g., VBench (Yu et al., 2023), EvalCrafter (Liu et al., 2023) or focus solely on audio fidelity (e.g., AudioCaps (Kim et al., 2019), AudioLDM-Eval (Liu et al., 2024a)), failing to capture the cross-modal semantic alignment and temporal synchronization that define realistic T2AV generation. On the other hand, emerging audiovideo benchmarks take important steps toward joint evaluation, yet they often face critical trade-offs: limited coverage of fine-grained coupling phenomena, insufficient handling of long and compositional prompts, reliance on narrow metric sets, or lack of interpretable diagnostic signals (e.g., instruction following, realism). For example, current evaluations struggle to answer core questions: Do generated sounds correspond to visible events? Are multiple audio sources synchronized with complex visual interactions? Does the model faithfully follow detailed instructions while maintaining physical and perceptual realism? These challenges are exacerbated by the intrinsic complexity of T2AV generation. Specifically, high-quality output requires simultaneous success along multiple axes: unimodal perceptual quality, cross-modal semantic alignment, * Equal Contribution.

(e) Hierarchical distribution of evaluation dimensions, clearly organizing objective metrics and MLLM-based assessments across video, audio, and cross-modal alignment. precise temporal synchronization, instruction following under compositional constraints, and realism grounded in physical and commonsense knowledge. To address this gap, as shown in Figure 1, we introduce T2AV-Compass, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating text-to-audio-video generation. Specifically, first, T2AVCompass employs taxonomy-driven curation pipeline to construct 500 complex prompts and ensure broad semantic coverage and challenging audiovisual scenarios, which impose precise constraints across cinematography, physical causality, and acoustic environments. Second, we propose duallevel evaluation framework that integrates objective evaluation based on classical automated metrics with subjective evaluation based on MLLM-as-judge. The objective evaluation quantifies video quality (technical fidelity, aesthetic appeal), audio quality (acoustic realism, semantic usefulness), and crossmodal alignment (text-audio/video semantic consistency, temporal synchronization). The subjective evaluation mainly evaluates video and audio instruction following abilities based on well-defined checklists and perceptual realism (e.g., physical plausibility and fine-grained details), which aims to address the limitations of automated metrics in capturing nuanced semantic and causal coherence. In summary, our contributions are threefold as follows: Taxonomy-Driven High-Complexity Benchmark: We introduce T2AV-Compass, benchmark comprising 500 semantically dense prompts synthesized through hybrid pipeline of taxonomybased curation and video inversion. It targets fine-grained audiovisual constraintssuch as off-screen sound and physical causalityfrequently overlooked in existing evaluations. Unified Dual-Level Evaluation Framework: We propose paradigm that integrates objective signal metrics with novel MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol. By employing reasoning-first diagnostic mechanism based on granular QA checklists and violation checks (e.g., Material-Timbre Consistency), our framework bridges the gap between low-level fidelity and high-level semantic logic with enhanced interpretability. Extensive Benchmarking and Empirical Insights: We conduct systematic evaluation of 11 state-of-the-art T2AV systems, including leading proprietary models like Veo-3.1 and Kling2.6. Our analysis unveils critical Audio Realism Bottleneck, revealing that current models struggle to synthesize physically grounded audio textures that match the fidelity of their visual counterparts."

Early work on video generation primarily focused on intrinsic visual fidelity and textvideo relevance (Yu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; 2024b; He et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025; Duan et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025).

Additionally, the table includes breakdown of sound types in terms of: Sound (general sound), Music (musical content), Speech (speech-related content), where applicable. The evaluation dimensions include: VQ (Video Quality), AQ (Audio Quality), CMA (Cross-Modal Alignment/Synchrony), IF (Instruction Following, which includes tasks involving constraints or negations), and RE (Realism Fidelity, which focuses on the perceived accuracy of the generated content beyond general perceptual quality). to audio and audiovideo generation, explicitly stressing temporal alignment and fine-grained semantic controllability (He et al., 2025; Hua et al., 2025; Iashin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Unimodal evaluation. Video benchmarks such as VBench assess visual fidelity, motion quality, and text video alignment with multi-dimensional rubrics (Yu et al., 2023), while text-to-audio benchmarks such as TTA-Bench focus on perceptual quality and robustness through large-scale human annotations (He et al., 2025). However, unimodal metrics cannot reliably determine whether generated audio and video remain consistent in timing, spatial cues, and semantic content (Iashin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Hua et al., 2025). Emerging text-to-audio-video generation benchmarks. As shown in Table 1, recent efforts introduce evaluation sets tailored for joint audiovideo generation. JavisBench focuses on diverse open-domain audiovideo generation and spatio-temporal alignment stress tests (Liu et al., 2025a), while Verse-Bench and Harmony-Bench provide structured test suites to probe synchronized generation across different acoustic scenarios (Wang et al., 2025b; Hu et al., 2025). VABench proposes multi-dimensional framework combining expert-model metrics with MLLM-based evaluation, covering multiple tasks and content categories (Hua et al., 2025). Nevertheless, existing benchmarks often necessitate trade-offs between (i) fine-grained semantic taxonomy, (ii) scalable, interpretable judging signals, and (iii) balanced coverage of diverse coupling phenomena (e.g., multi-source sound mixing, physical plausibility, and commonsense consistency). These limitations motivate the development of T2AV-Compass (Yu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; 2024b; Tong et al., 2025; He et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2025; He et al., 2025; Hua et al., 2025)."

Data Collection To establish foundation of broad semantic coverage, we aggregate raw prompts from variety of high-quality sources, including VidProM, the Kling AI community, LMArena, and Shot2Story (Wang and Yang, 2024; Kuaishou Technology, 2024; LMArena Community, 2024; Han et al., 2025) which showed in figure F. To mitigate the imbalance between common concepts and long-tail distributions, we implement semantic clustering strategy. Specifically, we encode all prompts using all-mpnet-base-v2 and perform deduplication with cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 (Reimers and 3 Figure 2: Data construction and checklist-based evaluation generation. The prompt suite is constructed from (1) curated community prompts with semantic deduplication (cos 0.8), clustering-based sampling, LLM rewriting, and human refinement, and (2) video-inversion stream using filtered 410s YouTube clips with dense captioning and manual verification. The finalized prompts are then converted into two types of checklists: instruction-alignment checks via slot extraction and dimension mapping, and perceptual-realism checks for video/audio quality. Gurevych, 2019). We then apply square-root sampling (where sampling probability is inversely proportional to the square root of cluster size) to preserve semantic distinctiveness while preventing the dominance of frequent topics. Prompt Refinement and Alignment. Raw prompts often lack the descriptive density for state-of-the-art models (e.g., Veo 3.1, Sora 2, Kling 2.6) (DeepMind, 2024; OpenAI, 2024; Kuaishou Technology, 2024; Wang et al., 2025c). To address this, we employ Gemini-2.5-Pro to restructure and enrich the sampled prompts. We enhance descriptions of visual subjects, motion dynamics, and acoustic events, while enforcing strict cinematographic constraints (e.g., camera angles, lighting). Following automated generation, we conduct rigorous manual audit to filter out static scenes or illogical compositions, resulting in curated subset of 400 complex prompts. Real-world Video Inversion. To counterbalance potential hallucinations in text-only generation and ensure physical plausibility (Guo et al., 2025; Duan et al., 2025). , we introduce Video-to-Text inversion stream. We select 100 diverse, high-fidelity video clips (410s) from YouTube and utilize Gemini-2.5-Pro to generate dense, temporally aligned captions. Discrepancies between the generated prompts and the source ground truth are resolved via human-in-the-loop verification, yielding 100 high-quality prompts anchored in real-world dynamics."

As depicted in Figure 1(b), our prompts exhibit notably higher token counts compared to existing baselines (e.g., JavisBench, VABench), more accurately mirroring the complexity of real-world user queries. The dataset encompasses broad spectrum of themes, soundscapes, and cinematographic styles, with the corresponding hierarchical QA distribution detailed in Figure 3(a). To quantify diversity, we analyze the semantic retention rates of CLIP (video) and CLAP (audio) embeddings after deduplication. As shown in Figures 1(c) and (d), our benchmark demonstrates superior semantic distinctiveness across both modalities, significantly outperforming concurrent datasets. Difficulty Analysis. We assess benchmark difficulty across four axes in Figure 3(b): (1) Visual Subject Multiplicity: 35.8% of samples feature crowds ( 4 subjects); (2) Audio Spatial Composition: 55.6% involve mixed on-screen/off-screen sources; (3) Event Temporal Structure: 28.2% contain long narrative chains ( 4 event units); (4) Audio Temporal Composition: 72.8% include simultaneous or overlapping audio events.

            "title": "3.3.1 Objective Evaluation",
            "content": "We use set of expert metrics to cover the three pillars above. Specifically, we measure video quality using perceptual and distributional metrics, audio quality using acoustic fidelity and intelligibility metrics, and cross-modal alignment using synchronization and semantic alignment metrics. Overall, these objective metrics offer stable and comparable basis for evaluating T2AV systems. Video Quality. We evaluate the visual performance of T2AV generation from two complementary perspectives: low-level technical fidelity and high-level aesthetic appeal. Video Technological Score (VT). This metric quantifies low-level visual integrity, explicitly penalizing artifacts such as noise, blur, and compression distortions. We employ DOVER++ (Wu et al., 2023) to score representative frames, aggregating frame-level predictions into holistic video score. Higher VT values signify cleaner, sharper, and more photorealistic renderings. Video Aesthetic Score (VA). This metric captures high-level perceptual attributes, including composition, lighting, and color harmony. We utilize the LAION-Aesthetic Predictor V2.5 (Schuhmann et al., 2022) on extracted keyframes. By averaging these scores, VA serves as proxy for subjective visual preference and artistic coherence. Audio Quality. We assess synthesized audio quality in isolation from the visual stream to reduce crossmodal interference effects. Following the Audiobox (Vyas et al., 2023) protocol, we use reference-free metrics to evaluate acoustic fidelity and semantic perceptibility in standardized manner. Perceptual Quality (PQ). PQ measures signal fidelity and acoustic realism of generated audio. It is sensitive to degradations such as background noise, bandwidth limitations, and unnatural timbre. Higher scores indicate clear, high-fidelity audio that approximates natural recordings. Content Usefulness (CU). CU quantifies the semantic validity and information density of the generated audio. It evaluates whether the synthesized signals contain distinguishable and meaningful auditory eventsas opposed to generic textures or indeterminate noiseensuring that the audio possesses sufficient semantic content to be practically usable. Figure 4: Illustration of the subjective evaluation framework in T2AV-Compass. Unlike traditional metrics, our protocol provides interpretable diagnosis through two distinct tracks: (Top) Instruction following is evaluated via rigorous Q&A checklist pairs, ensuring semantic alignment in complex scenarios like social interactions and sound effects. (Bottom) Realism scrutinizes perceptual quality, rewarding fine-grained details (e.g., fur texture) while explicitly penalizing visual hallucinations (e.g., two-headed dog) or audio dissonance. The examples demonstrate the judges ability to discern model capabilities (Veo-3.1 vs. Ovi-1.1) with grounded evidence. Cross-modal Alignment. We evaluate cross-modal alignment to ensure coherence across text, audio, and video. Our protocol assesses two dimensions: semantic consistency and temporal synchronization. TextAudio (TA) Alignment. We measure TA alignment using CLAP (Elizalde et al., 2022), which maps text and audio into shared embedding space. The cosine similarity between embeddings reflects semantic correspondence between the generated audio and the prompt. TextVideo (TV) Alignment. Visual adherence to the prompt is evaluated via VideoCLIPXL-V2 (Wang et al., 2024). We compute the cosine similarity between text and video feature embeddings to measure the high-level semantic consistency of the visual content. AudioVideo (AV) Alignment. To assess cross-modal consistency independent of the text prompt, we compute AV semantic similarity using ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023). This score checks whether generated audio events align semantically with the visual content. Temporal Synchronization. Beyond semantics, we assess temporal correspondence between audio and visual events using DeSync (DS) computed by Synchformer (Iashin et al., 2023). DS measures synchronization error as the absolute time offset between audio and visual onsets, averaged over video (lower is better). For talking-face scenarios, we additionally report LatentSync (LS) (Li et al., 2024), SyncNet-based lip-sync metric for diagnosing speechlip synchronization."

This framework comprises two distinct evaluation tracks: Instruction Following Verification (IFV) and Realism. Crucially, we enforce reasoning-first protocol, mandating that the judge explicitly articulates the rationale behind its decision prior to assigning score on 5-point scale. This protocol not only enhances interpretability but also significantly facilitates downstream error attribution. Instruction Following (IF). This track assesses the models fidelity to textual prompts.

Composed systems remain highly effective for specific metrics. Notably, the Wan-2.2 + HunyuanFoley pipeline achieves the highest score in Video Realism, surpassing all end-to-end models. This suggests that chaining expert models effectively preserves unimodal fidelity, yielding superior perceptual quality."

            "content": "Figure 5: Macro-level comparison across six evaluation dimensions. We report the averaged Video Instruction-Following score (Video IF, Avg.) of five representative models (Veo-3.1, Wan-2.5, Ovi-1.1, PixVerse-V5.5, and Sora-2) on Aesthetics, Attribute, Cinematography, Dynamics, Relations, and World. Overall, Veo-3.1 and Wan-2.5 form the top tier with consistently strong performance; Sora-2 is competitive on Attribute and Cinema but lags on Dynamics; PixVerse exhibits mid-range performance across most dimensions; and Ovi-1.1 shows the lowest scores, with the largest gaps on Dynamics and World. Analysis on Sub-dimensions of Instruction Following (Video) As illustrated in Figure 5, the macrolevel evaluation reveals clear stratification of model capabilities across the six visual dimensions. Veo-3.1 and Wan-2.5 consistently constitute the top tier, demonstrating robust and balanced performance across Aesthetics, Attribute, and Cinematography(Cinema). Notably, Sora-2 remains highly competitive in static-centric dimensions such as Attribute and World, even surpassing the other leaders in the latter, which suggests strong prior in factual and naturalistic grounding. However, Dynamics emerges as the most challenging and discriminative dimension for all systems. Wan-2.5 attains the peak score in Dynamics, with Veo-3.1 following closely, underscoring their relative strength in executing motion-centric instructions. In contrast, Sora-2 exhibits noticeable decline in this category, indicating potential bottleneck in maintaining complex temporal coherence and interactions. For open-sourced models, 8 Figure 6: Multi-metric radar comparison of representative T2AV systems. We report five complementary criteria for overall generation quality: AAS, MSS, MTC, OIS, and TCS (higher is better). The leftmost panel summarizes the average performance across models, while the remaining panels present per-model radar profiles for OVI-1.1, PixVerse-V5.5, Sora-2, Wan-2.5, and Veo-3.1, respectively. Overall, Veo-3.1 and Sora-2 achieve the strongest balanced performance, whereas OVI-1.1 shows the lowest scores with particularly weak MTC. the Ovi-1.1 struggles in Dynamics and World, reflecting significant difficulties in handling temporally demanding tasks and knowledge-intensive prompts. Analysis on Sub-dimensions of Realism As shown in Figure 6, the radar plots provide holistic view of model behavior under five complementary criteria for video realism (MSS, OIS, and TCS) and audio realism (AAS and MTC). From an overall perspective, the evaluated systems exhibit consistent trend: OIS and TCS achieve relatively higher scores for strong models, while MTC remains the most challenging dimension and contributes the largest cross-model variance. For example, Veo-3.1 demonstrates the most balanced high-level performance, leading on MSS and maintaining strong OIS/TCS, indicating robust content presentation and temporal consistency. Sora-2 is highly competitive and attains the strongest OIS and TCS, but shows lower value on AAS, suggesting that its strengths lie more in overall realism/coherence than in fine-grained attribute adherence. Wan-2.5 forms the second tier with solid OIS/TCS yet noticeably weaker MSS/MTC, implying relative gap in multi-aspect stability and cross-topic robustness."

            "content": "We introduced T2AV-Compass, unified benchmark for systematically evaluating text-to-audio-video generation. By combining taxonomy-driven prompt construction pipeline with dual-level evaluation framework, T2AV-Compass enables fine-grained and diagnostic assessment of video quality, audio quality, cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and realism. Extensive experiments across broad set of representative T2AV systems demonstrate that our benchmark effectively differentiates model capabilities and exposes diverse failure modes that are not captured by existing evaluations. We hope T2AV-Compass serves as practical and evolving foundation for advancing both the evaluation and modeling of text-to-audio-video generation. References Uriel Singer, Adam Polyak, et al.

Specifically, we utilize the default video frame rates and audio sampling rates provided by the original models. Regarding spatial resolution, most systems are configured to output at 720p. To ensure comprehensive comparison, we set Javis to 480p resolution, while Kling-2.6 is leveraged at 1080p. Notably, for systems based on Ovi-1.1 and composed generation, we employ Gemini-2.5-Pro to paraphrase the original prompts. This ensures the input text aligns with the specific reasoning and instruction-following requirements of their respective generation pipelines, thereby facilitating more equitable performance assessment. 14 Table 7: Technical Quality Evaluation Framework: Five Scoring Dimensions and Sub-dimensions Dimension Sub-dimension"

This multi-source aggregation ensures that T2AV-Compass captures wide spectrum of user intents, ranging from creative storytelling to rigorous physical interaction scenarios. Semantic Denoising and Diversity Enhancement To mitigate the inherent imbalance between common concepts (e.g., generic landscapes) and long-tail distributions (e.g., specific causal physical events), we implement sophisticated semantic clustering and sampling strategy: Embedding and Deduplication: We encode all candidate prompts into high-dimensional semantic space using all-mpnet-base-v2. To eliminate redundant entries while preserving subtle 15 stylistic variations, we perform aggressive deduplication using cosine similarity threshold of 0.8. Square-root Sampling: We cluster the deduplicated prompts and apply square-root sampling (cid:112)Sc (Sc being the cluster strategy, where the sampling probability is defined as P(c) 1/ size). This approach effectively suppresses over-represented topics and elevates the visibility of niche, semantically distinctive scenarios, ensuring the benchmark is not biased toward frequent but simplistic prompts. F.2 Real Video Collection Real-World Reference Collection To establish an empirical realism ceiling and provide high-fidelity baseline for the T2AV-Compass benchmark, we curated diverse collection of authentic videos sourced from YouTube. Each entry is meticulously documented with its source URL and precise temporal segments (start and end timestamps) to ensure full reproducibility. We implemented multi-stage expert filtering pipeline based on the following criteria: Spatiotemporal Specifications: All videos strictly adhere to 16:9 aspect ratio with minimum native resolution of 720p (unified to 720p in post-processing). To capture meaningful semantic units, clips are trimmed to 510 seconds. The content spans various complexities, ranging from single-event visual atoms (e.g., person smiling) to intricate, sequential narratives involving four or more logical steps (e.g., person picking up glass and dropping it). Anti-Overfitting & Integrity: We prioritized content published after October 2024 to mitigate potential data leakage from the training sets of current T2AV models. We manually excluded User-Generated Content (UGC) with watermarks, heavy text overlays, or rapid montage-style editing (2 cuts per clip), while retaining scene-inherent text necessary for narrative context. Audiovisual Complexity: The collection emphasizes rich, multi-layered soundscapes featuring 1 4 distinct sound effects and essential off-screen audio (e.g., ambient BGM or narration). Notably, 30% of the videos contain coherent human speech, while 70% incorporate diverse camera dynamics, including linear translation, angular rotation, zooming, and realistic handheld jitters, to test the models ability to handle non-static viewpoints. Thematic Distribution: The reference set mirrors our proposed taxonomy across seven domains: Modern Life & Drama (25%), Documentary & History (23%), Fantasy (17%), Sci-Fi (14%), Animation (14%), Horror & Humor (14%), and Commercial & Promotion (13%)."

Criterion: Please rate the completion quality of the video on 5-point Likert scale: -1: strongly incomplete (completely failed / Not present). -2: Somewhat incomplete (Poor / Major discrepancies). -3: Neutral (Fair / Acceptable but still has flaws). -4: Somewhat complete (Good / Mostly accurate). -5: Fully complete (Excellent / Perfectly meets the standard). You must respond ONLY with valid JSON object using the following structure: { \"reason\": \"A detailed explanation for your rating.\", \"score\": An integer between 1 and 5 } G.5 MLLM Judge-Realism Prompt MSS (Motion Smoothness Score) Prompt for video motion smoothness / temporal stability # Role Definition You are computer vision expert specializing in temporal video analysis and signal processing. Your expertise is evaluating inter-frame quality, especially distinguishing physically plausible motion blur (cid:44) from generation failures such as unnatural artifacts or temporal jitter. # Task Description will provide video generated by text-to-video model. Please focus on transition quality and visual stability (cid:44) between frames. Ignore scene logic (that is not your job). Concentrate only on pixel-level smoothness and stability, (cid:44) then assign an MSS (Motion Smoothness Score). # Evaluation Dimensions (MSS Guidelines) Before scoring, analyze the video carefully along the three dimensions below: 1. Artifacts & Degradation: - Unnatural blur: Is there blur that cannot be explained by camera motion or fast object motion? (e.g., static object suddenly becomes smeared). - Tearing / mosaic: Are there blocky pixels, bursts of noise, or momentary structural collapse? - Flickering: Is there high-frequency brightness flicker or texture popping? 2. Fluidity of Motion: - Perceived frame rate: Does the video feel coherent, or does it stutter with dropped-frame sensations? (cid:44) - Optical-flow consistency: Are pixel trajectories smooth, or do they exhibit abrupt (cid:44) frame-to-frame jumps (jitter)? 3. Scene-aware analysis: - Distinguish dynamic vs. static scenes: For high-motion scenes (e.g., racing, fighting), some (cid:44) motion blur is plausible (and can be acceptable). For static/slow scenes (e.g., dialogue, landscapes), any blur should be treated as defect. (cid:44) Adjust your tolerance based on scene dynamics. # Scoring Standards (1-5 Scale) Provide an integer score from 1 to 5: - 1 (Bad): Severe collapse, intense flicker, or persistent unnatural blur; details are hardly recognizable and cause discomfort. (cid:44) - 2 (Poor): Clearly unsmooth motion with frequent stutters or obvious artifacts; subject/background often becomes inexplicably blurry. (cid:44) - 3 (Fair): Mostly smooth, but visible quality drops in complex motion or mild inter-frame jitter. - 4 (Good): Smooth and natural motion; only minor texture loss in few high-motion frames. - 5 (Perfect): Extremely smooth transitions; cinematic and physically plausible motion blur; no (cid:44) artifacts or abnormal jitter. # Output Format Output ONLY valid JSON string (no Markdown code fences), in the following format: \"reason\": \"Provide detailed analysis of artifacts, smoothness, and scene-aware blur handling here.\", \"MSS\": <an integer from 1 to 5> OIS (Object Integrity Score) Prompt for structural/anatomical integrity under motion # Role Definition You are computer vision expert with strong knowledge in anatomy and structural mechanics. 27 You specialize in detecting structural and morphological consistency of moving subjects. Think like an orthopedic (cid:44) doctor and structural engineer: catch any non-physical deformations during motion. # Task Description will provide video generated by text-to-video model. Focus on the structural integrity of the moving subject (cid:44) (human, animal, or object). Judge whether the subject maintains plausible physical structure during motion, then (cid:44) assign an OIS (Object Integrity Score). # Evaluation Dimensions (OIS Guidelines) Before scoring, analyze carefully along the three dimensions below: 1. Biological Anatomical Constraints: - Limb-length consistency: Do limbs unnaturally stretch/shrink during motion (rubber-man effect)? (cid:44) - Joint-angle limits: Are there impossible joint bends, excessive twists, or non-physical (cid:44) rotations? (e.g., knees bending the wrong way, head rotating 360 degrees). - Facial stability: Do facial features melt, distort, or shift during motion/turning? 2. Rigid Body Rigidity: - Shape preservation: Do rigid objects (vehicles, buildings, furniture) deform like jelly during movement/camera turns? (cid:44) - Edges and contours: Do outlines remain stable, or do they wobble and warp irregularly? 3. Texture & Semantic Consistency: - Do texture details (e.g., clothing patterns, logos) stay consistent across frames, or randomly (cid:44) morph over time? # Scoring Standards (1-5 Scale) Provide an integer score from 1 to 5: - 1 (Bad): Severe deformation; subject becomes unrecognizable; violates physical structure. - 2 (Poor): Obvious structural errors (limb stretching, face collapse, rigid-body warping); strong uncanny feeling. (cid:44) - 3 (Fair): Subject mostly recognizable, but large motions cause proportion issues, hand/detail corruption, or mild rigid deformation. (cid:44) - 4 (Good): Structure largely preserved; only tiny contour jitter in very fast motion or near occlusion boundaries. (cid:44) - 5 (Perfect): Rock-solid structural integrity throughout; anatomy/rigid-body dynamics remain (cid:44) physically plausible. # Output Format Output ONLY valid JSON string (no Markdown code fences), in the following format: \"reason\": \"Provide detailed analysis of anatomy, rigid deformation, and structural constraints here.\", \"OIS\": <an integer from 1 to 5> TCS (Temporal Coherence Score) Prompt for object permanence / identity stability over time # Role Definition You are computer vision expert in multi-object tracking and scene understanding.

Focus on existence continuity along the timeline. (cid:44) Track the main objects (subjects), check whether they follow object permanence, then assign TCS (cid:44) (Temporal Coherence Score). 28 # Evaluation Dimensions (TCS Guidelines) Before scoring, analyze carefully along the three dimensions below: 1. Existence Continuity: - Abnormal disappearance: Does an object vanish without occlusion or leaving the frame? - Abnormal appearance: Does an object pop in without plausible source (entering the frame / un-occluding)? (cid:44) - Flicker: Does an object rapidly disappear and reappear across consecutive frames? 2. Identity Stability: - Category flip: Does moving object suddenly change category/species (e.g., dog becomes cat, or turns into chair)? (cid:44) - Appearance flip: Without drastic lighting changes, do color/clothing/core attributes change (cid:44) inexplicably? 3. Occlusion & Boundary Logic: - Reasonable filtering: If an object exits the frame, enters shadow, or is occluded by (cid:44) foreground object, that is correct and should NOT be penalized. - Reappearance consistency: After occlusion, does the object reappear as the same identity? # Scoring Standards (1-5 Scale) Provide an integer score from 1 to 5: - 1 (Bad): Severe incoherence; frequent random flicker, disappearances, or identity swaps (hallucination-like). (cid:44) - 2 (Poor): Major object loss or clear identity flips that break narrative continuity. - 3 (Fair): Main objects mostly persist, but background/secondary objects occasionally pop in/out, or reappearance fails after occlusion. (cid:44) - 4 (Good): Tracking is stable; only brief flickers on tiny/ambiguous objects near boundaries; little impact on overall coherence. (cid:44) - 5 (Perfect): Strong object permanence; disappear/appear behavior fully follows occlusion and (cid:44) physical boundary logic; identities remain locked. # Output Format Output ONLY valid JSON string (no Markdown code fences), in the following format: \"reason\": \"Provide detailed analysis of disappear/appear events, identity stability, and occlusion logic here.\", \"TCS\": <an integer from 1 to 5> AAS (Acoustic Artifact Score) Prompt for audio artifacts / technical fidelity (reference-free) # Role Definition You are an audio signal processing expert and an audiophile-level sound engineer. Your task is not to judge audio content, but to evaluate technical fidelity and detect auditory artifacts introduced (cid:44) by generation algorithms. # Task Description will provide video generated by an AI model. Ignore the visuals; focus only on the purity and coherence of the audio stream. (cid:44) Detect unnatural noise, distortion, or algorithmic defects, then assign an AAS (Acoustic Artifact (cid:44) Score). # Evaluation Dimensions (AAS Guidelines) Before scoring, analyze carefully along the three dimensions below: 1. Generative Artifacts: - Metallic / robotic tone: Does speech or environmental audio have an unnatural metallic sheen, electronic tone, or phasey/comb-filter effects? (cid:44) - Smearing: Are transient sounds (e.g., claps, drums) blurred or smeared instead of crisp? - Bandwidth truncation: Are highs severely missing, making audio sound underwater or like (cid:44) low-bitrate telephone quality? 29 2. Temporal Stability: - Pops and dropouts: Are there random pops, clicks, or brief silent gaps? - Noise-floor consistency: Is background noise stable, or does it \"breathe\"/pump with the (cid:44) foreground audio? 3. Signal Integrity: - Clipping/distortion: Is there clipping at high-volume segments? - Hallucinated noise: Are there strange, scene-irrelevant noises (e.g., electrical hum, radio (cid:44) interference)? # Scoring Standards (1-5 Scale) Provide an integer score from 1 to 5: - 1 (Bad): Extremely poor; harsh electronic noise/metallic artifacts/frequent pops; nearly unusable. (cid:44) - 2 (Poor): Clear generation artifacts; muddy/dull sound; unstable noise floor; fatiguing to listen to. (cid:44) - 3 (Fair): Acceptable clarity but noticeable algorithmic noise/phase issues in quiet or high-frequency regions. (cid:44) - 4 (Good): Mostly clean; only minor transient imperfections; non-experts may not notice. - 5 (Perfect): Studio-grade high fidelity; full-band response; crisp transients; no pumping or (cid:44) mechanical artifacts. # Output Format Output ONLY valid JSON string (no Markdown code fences), in the following format: \"reason\": \"Provide detailed analysis of electronic artifacts, distortion, frequency response, and noise-floor stability here.\", \"AAS\": <an integer from 1 to 5> MTC (MaterialTimbre Consistency) Prompt for materialsound matching and environmental acoustics # Role Definition You are senior Foley artist with 20 years of experience and an acoustic physicist. You are highly sensitive to sound textures produced by different materials (metal, wood, glass, liquids, fabric, etc.) (cid:44) under physical interactions, and you understand spatial acoustics (reverb characteristics). # Task Description will provide video generated by an AI model. Ignore background music (if any). Focus on sound-source objects and their environment. (cid:44) Compare visual physical properties with auditory timbre, judge whether they match or cause perceptual mismatch, then assign an (cid:44) MTC (Material--Timbre Consistency) score. # Evaluation Dimensions (MTC Guidelines) Before scoring, analyze carefully along the three dimensions below: 1. Material--Timbre Matching: - Core texture: Is the material of the sounding object (e.g., hollow metal pipe vs solid wood stick vs shattered glass) reflected correctly in the sound? (cid:44) - Spectral characteristics: Does the spectrum match physics (heavy objects -> low-frequency (cid:44) impact; light/thin objects -> high-frequency overtones; metal -> crisp transients; plastic -> dull/muffled)? - Example failures: Footsteps on gravel but sounding like smooth concrete; knocking metal door (cid:44) but sounding like wood. 2. Interaction Dynamics: - Force response: Does loudness/envelope (attack/decay) match action strength? (A light touch should not sound like huge impact.) (cid:44) - State change: If object state changes (e.g., water poured into cup and level rises), does (cid:44) pitch change accordingly? 3. Environmental Acoustics / Reverb: - Space match: Do perceived reverb/echo match the visual space and surfaces (small bathroom vs (cid:44) open canyon; carpet vs tiles)? - Dry/wet separation: Outdoor open scenes should sound \"dry\"; churches/empty rooms should sound (cid:44) \"wet\" with long RT60. # Scoring Standards (1-5 Scale) Provide an integer score from 1 to 5: - 1 (Bad): Severe mismatch; material or space acoustics are completely wrong; very immersion-breaking. (cid:44) - 2 (Poor): Broad material class is roughly right but details are wrong, or audio feels pasted-on studio-dry sound with no environment. (cid:44) - 3 (Fair): Generally plausible but lacks fine texture variation; reverb is generic and not scene-specific. (cid:44) - 4 (Good): Material timbre is recognizable; footsteps/collisions distinguish surfaces; reverb is largely appropriate. (cid:44) - 5 (Perfect): Extremely realistic; convincingly conveys weight, density, and surface texture; (cid:44) environment acoustics match the scene (cinema-grade foley). # Output Format Output ONLY valid JSON string (no Markdown code fences), in the following format: \"reason\": \"Provide detailed analysis of material recognition, interaction feedback, and environmental reverb matching here.\", \"MTC\": <an integer from 1 to 5>"
