            "content": "Humans learn and improve through rich feedback from others Take the example of writing an academic paper. Authors typically write first draft, seek feedback from their colleagues (informally or through peer review) and improve their paper based on the feedback. Similarly, when writing new code, developers commonly create Pull/Merge Request, seek feedback from other developers and improve their code based on the feedback. Outside of writing paper/code, even as we are taking significant life decisions (e.g. choosing job or PhD program), we first develop an initial inclination, seek feedback from family/friends Figure 1: Dedicated Feedback and Edit Models enables Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct to reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, compared to 90.4 achieved by OpenAI o1-preview-2024-0912 (LMSys, 2024) and 92.3 by DeepSeek R1 (DeepSeekAI et al., 2025) * means model specialized in Math, Coding and Logic problems, which are highly represented in Arena Hard. and update our decision in light of their feedback. In each of these cases, we benefit from rich feedback that goes beyond whether the initial draft is good/bad, and discusses why specific areas might be of concern and how those can be improved. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback is not enough While feedback from humans has inspired methods to align large language models such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), we have thus far only utilized limited forms of such feedback. Early works (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022) use information on whether response is preferred in terms of its helpfulness over the other. Subsequent works expand upon the single dimension of preferences by adding dimensions such as factual correctness, creativity, complexity and coherence (Wu et al., 2023; Köpf et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c). However, such fixed dimensions might still be insufficient to capture the holistic feedback for response. For instance, if response is marked down on factual correctness, it might not be specific enough to infer where such mistakes were made, especially if the response contains thousands of words. Welleck et al. (2022) supports this belief by finding that oracle natural language feedback (i.e. based on differences from the ground truth correct answer) can be more helpful than ratingonly scalar feedback on math, constrained natural language generation and toxicity reduction tasks but it remains unclear how useful natural language feedback will be in tasks without ground truth correct answers, which are common among general domain tasks. Inference-Time Scaling by training models to think before responding is insufficient popular technique for inference-time scaling is to train models to think before responding. This has been used by many models including QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024), Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (GoogleDeepmind, 2024) and Deepseek R1 (DeepSeekAI et al., 2025). reproduction attempt (Qin et al., 2024) of OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024) uses similar approach. While this approach is promising, it should not be regarded as the only axis for inference-time scaling. Techniques utilized to induce such behavior typically require that tasks have answers that can be verified, restricting their application to domains such as math, multiplechoice question answering and competitive coding situations. These techniques include Reinforcement Learning with verifiers (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Lambert et al., 2024), Process Reward Models (Lightman et al., 2023), Generative Verifiers (Zhang et al., 2024b,c), Monte-Carlo Tree Search (Zhang et al., 2024a), Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023) and Execution Feedback (Gehring et al., 2024). However, there exists large set of openended but challenging problems for which no such ground-truth verifiable answers exists. Such problems include proposing good research ideas (Si et al., 2024), writing speech for important events or even coming up with an effective approach for delivering complex software product. Interestingly, OpenAI (2024) found that GPT-4o (without thinking before responding) is preferred over OpenAI o1 in the domain of personal writing, suggesting that thinking-before-responding is not suited for some tasks. Therefore, there needs to be complementary approaches for inference-time scaling."

            "title": "Efficacy of LLMs in providing feedback and\nmaking edits to their own responses is unclear",
            "content": "Given the value of feedback and refinement loops for inference-time scaling, the most straightforward solution is to simply prompt an instructionfollowing LLM to provide feedback and/or editing on its own (Anthropic, 2024; Yuan et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024). While this is possible, LLMs that were not specifically trained might not be able to provide effective feedback leading to minimal improvements relative to high quality feedback (Chen et al., 2023; Tyen et al., 2024). supporting observation is that using feedback from general instructionfollowing models (Ye et al., 2024; Ankner et al., 2024) is less useful for preference modeling compared to using feedback from model that has been trained (using distant supervision signals) to generate better feedback (Yu et al., 2024). There are some reports that LLMs can selfcorrect when given high quality feedback for code/reasoning-related (Chen et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2024; Tyen et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024) and documented-grounded/summarization tasks (Saunders et al., 2022; Wadhwa et al., 2024). However, we are not aware of any study on whether LLMs can productively edit their responses based on provided feedback in general domain tasks. Relatedly, Ji et al. (2024) show that specifically trained model can improve model responses to general domain tasks without using feedback, but its efficacy relative to improvements conditioned on feedback is under-explored."

            "title": "2 Dataset",
            "content": "2.1 Data Collection Prompt Curation Our data consists of prompts from several categories (General, STEM, Coding and Multilingual), similar to Llama 3 data (Dubey et al., 2024). Across all tasks, we perform filter to exclude potentially unsafe prompts/responses (e.g. harmful content, illegal activities, profanity, bias and stereotyping) and ask annotators to skip tasks missed by our filter, in addition to tasks containing Personally Identifiable Information (e.g. name, address, SSN, email, phone numbers). Following HelpSteer2 (Wang et al., 2024b), we sourced Coding and Multilingual prompts from ShareGPT (RyokoAI, 2023), dataset curated from user conversations with ChatGPT that are voluntarily shared. We chose ShareGPT because HelpSteer2 has demonstrated promise as high-quality preference modeling dataset but previously lacked Coding and Multilingual prompts. For General and STEM prompts, we use WildChat (Zhao et al., 2024), dataset similar to ShareGPT but significantly larger (approximately 1 million prompts), to minimize potential overlap with HelpSteer2. Further details on prompt language classification and preprocessing steps are provided in Appendix A. Response Generation Following HelpSteer2 (Wang et al., 2024b), we generate two responses per prompt using diverse selection of models, including Nemotron 4 340B Instruct (Nvidia et al., 2024), Mistral Large 2 (Mistral, 2024c), Mistral 7B-Instruct-v0.3 (Mistral, 2024b), Mixtral 8x22B Instruct (Mistral, 2024e), Mixtral 8x7B Instruct (Jiang et al., 2024), Mistral NeMo 12B (Mistral, 2024d), Codestral 22B (Mistral, 2024a), Gemma 2 (2B, 9B, 27B) (Team et al., 2024b), Gemma 2B (Team et al., 2024a), Phi 3 (Mini, Small, Medium) (Abdin et al., 2024), IBM Granite (8B and 34B) (Mishra et al., 2024) and Snowflake Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). We selected these models because they were popular at the start of our annotation exercise and have commercially permissive licenses. All models were accessed through the NVIDIA API Catalog (NVIDIA, 2024c). To enhance the compatibility of our Feedback and Edit Models, we deliberately included models with varying sizes and capabilities, prioritizing larger models for generating more responses. Responses were generated with temperature 0, top 0.9 and maximum tokens of 3072. Multi-turn Prompt Completion Following HelpSteer2 (Wang et al., 2024b), we include multiturn prompts because users might want to apply Feedback-Edit loop for follow-up prompts. Instead of using ChatGPT generated assistant turns from ShareGPT/WildChat, we use the models used for response generation to generate intermediate assistant turns. This was done to avoid using any ChatGPT response in our dataset curation process. Feedback Annotation Annotators are asked to provide free-text feedback on the overall helpfulness of the last assistant response in conversation. Concretely, annotators are asked to provide feedback of 2-10 sentences (50 - 250 words) that starts with The response is {not / slightly / partially / mostly / perfectly} helpful. For Multilingual data, we specifically encourage the annotators to provide feedback if the response language is not the same as the prompt language or the language the user expects the output in (e.g. for translation/languagelearning tasks). For Coding data, we encourage the annotators to provide feedback on whether there are sufficient comments to describe the code and whether code follows best practices recommended by Google (2024). All feedback is provided in English, including for Multilingual responses. Annotators evaluate two responses from different models sequentially, with the ability to review both before finalizing their feedback. This process helps calibrate their assessments and prevents overly harsh feedback for minor errors. Following HelpSteer2 (Wang et al., 2024b), we assign 35 annotators per task to reduce subjectivity and ensure more balanced feedback across model responses. We collaborate with data annotation vendor, Scale AI, to recruit annotators for General, STEM, and Coding tasks. STEM and Coding tasks have stricter inclusion criteria, requiring annotators to have relevant qualifications, such as undergraduate degrees in related fields or software engineering experience. These tasks, along with their associated prompts and responses, are conducted in English only. For Multilingual tasks, we partner with separate vendor, Translated. Across both vendors, we recruit over 7,000 annotators from more than 80 countries, with details provided in Table 7. Annotators are encouraged to use internet resources for fact-checking when necessary but prohibited from using LLMs. Response Editing We consolidate feedback for each task and send them to separate pools of annotators to edit responses based on the provided feedback. Our qualitative inspection of early feedback suggests that outlier annotations (i.e. an annotator who finds response to be slightly helpful when four annotators find it perfectly helpful) tend to be mistaken. Therefore, we follow HelpSteer2 to only use feedback from three annotators that agree most with one another, in terms of their overall helpful judgment. We note that feedback from three annotators is preferable to feedback from single annotator, as different people may identify distinct areas for improvement, even if their overall assessments of helpfulness are similar. Additionally, we find that responses rated as either perfectly helpful or not helpful by most annotators are not suitable for editing. The former cannot be meaningfully improved while the latter needs to be rewritten entirely. Therefore, we exclude such responses. 2.2 Data Pre-processing Using the collected data, we formulate three datasets for model training: Feedback Demonstration aims to show models how humans provide feedback in order to train them to imitate such feedback, given user prompt and model response. With the data collected for Feedback Annotation, we perform few data cleaning steps. First, we retain only the three feedback per prompt that agree most to filter out outliers. An advantage of using multiple feedback per response is that it increases the diversity of potential model responses when doing sampling, instead of over-fitting to single feedback. Then, we remove prompts for which the three most agreeing prompts have too large disagreement (e.g. one finds the response to be perfectly helpful while another finds it to be slightly helpful). Such large degree of disagreement typically suggests that one or more of the annotators overlooked or misunderstood an important aspect of the response. Edit Demonstration seeks to show how humans edit responses by training the model to generate an edited response given user prompt, model response and set of feedback. We first filter out any feedback that starts with that The model response is perfectly helpful because such type of feedback does not contain any suggestion for improvement. We also want to exclude feedback that was not used in the editing process to ensure the model learns to apply every piece of feedback. However, we did not collect any data that explicitly specifies which feedback were (actually) used to edit the response. Therefore, we use distant supervision signal to identify this instead. Specifically, we use the change summary that each edit annotator needed to write to accompany their edits. We then prompt Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (Llama, 2024) to see if the change summary addresses the issues mentioned in the feedback (prompt template in Appendix B). Feedback which were not mentioned in the change summary were excluded. Finally, we include all permutations of linearized feedback from the set of feedback, in order to teach the model the orderindependence of the feedback when performing the edit. Edit Preference is used to train model to distinguish good edits from unsatisfactory edits. The first type of unsatisfactory edits are bad edits that are not based on the feedback, but instead on what an edit annotator thought was needed (see Appendix for details). This was common issue during our initial annotation. We identified tasks that have bad edit as well as good edit (i.e. the task was reworked later on such that it follows the provided feedback). The second type of undesirable edits is when no edit was made (i.e. the edited response simply copies the original model response). While this was not seen in the human annotated data, we observed this phenomenon in substantial fraction of model trained on the Edit Demonstration dataset. We believe this might be related to how Supervised Fine-tuning calculates loss at token level and hence the model might learn short-cut that simply copying the original response can minimize the loss for most tokens since the human edits preserve most initial tokens. We create an Edit Preference dataset by having these two types of unsatisfactory edits in 1:1 ratio, paired with the corresponding Good Edit. Only data relating to General/STEM subsets is available for this task."

Table 1 shows that more than half of the data from both Feedback and Edit Demonstration datasets are from specialist annotators (STEM, Coding and Multilingual). This means that the datasets contains diverse feedback and edits, which can help train models to be useful across domains. The dataset also contains 14 programming and 13 natural languages with detailed distributions in Appendix D. An example of General task is in Appendix E. the original responses (within 100 characters). On the Coding subset however, there is substantial increase in average length by 782 characters. This is likely due to the Edit annotator adding more comments and explanation to the code or including handling of edge cases not included in the original response (e.g. making solution work on Windows in addition to Unix systems). Feedback Demonstration Multilingual feedback (339.2 characters) tends to be shorter while coding feedback (518.6 characters) is longer than overall (437.8 characters). Our qualitative inspections of the multilingual feedback suggests that multilingual prompts tend to be straightforward and do not typically require annotators to perform extensive fact checking in order to provide feedback. Therefore, feedback annotators might have less content to write. On the other hand, coding prompts often require annotators to check the code implementation (often using real-world software libraries). This means that feedback annotators can point out concrete issues with the code, giving them more to write in their feedback. Edit Demonstration on average contains slightly fewer than 3 feedback per response (2.3), as small fraction has been removed due to the feedback mentioning that the response is perfect (and hence no need to edit) or the change summary accompanying the edit not mentioning issues raised by the feedback (and likely ignored by the annotator). Original responses are moderately long at 1642.7 characters and similar in length to the responses in HelpSteer2 with 1492.6 characters (Wang et al., 2024b). Coding responses tend to be substantially longer at 2243.7 characters, likely due to extensive white-spaces in languages such as Python. Conversely, multilingual responses have fewer characters (1141.4) possibly because many languages in the dataset (see Table 6) use scripts different from the Roman alphabets used in English.

Within the General, STEM and Multilingual subsets, the edited responses have similar length as Edit Preference In Table 2, bad edits tend to lead to decrease in response length by an average of 122.1 characters. This is likely because such edits are typically based on the edit annotators own opinion of what should be changed and the averse incentive for annotators to shorten responses since its relatively easier to delete content than to write new content. On the other hand, good edits result in minimal change of response length (an increase of 32.5 characters, with std. of 727), suggesting that annotators of good edits were willing to either include missing content or exclude superfluous writing, depending on provided feedback."

            "title": "3.1 Evaluation",
            "content": "Metrics Following Wang et al. (2024a); Dong et al. (2024); Meng et al. (2024), we measure the helpfulness of models to general-domain prompts using three popular metrics: AlpacaEval 2.0 Length Controlled (Dubois et al., 2024), GPT-4Turbo MT Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) and Arena Hard (Li et al., 2024). AlpacaEval contains Easy prompts, MT Bench contains Medium-difficulty prompts (including multi-turn) and Arena Hard contains the hardest prompts. All responses are generated greedily. To give sense of average response length, we report the mean number of characters in MT Bench responses. MT Bench is also used as validation metric for checkpoint selection. Further details are in Appendix F. Feedback and Edit Generation We generate 10 feedback per initial response with temperature of 0.7 and top of 0.9. We then exclude any feedback which finds the initial response perfectly helpful, since such feedback does not contain information for improvement for the Edit model to make. Out of the remaining feedback, we randomly choose up to 3 feedback for generating an edit of the initial response. The choice of generating 10 feedback was made to balance the amount of feedback required against having most responses having 3 feedback after filtering. We then greedily generate the edited response conditioned on the prompt, initial response, and feedback. Prompt templates for feedback and edit generation can be found in Appendix B. 3.2 Model Training We use the Llama 3.3 70B Instruct model (Llama, 2024) to initialize Feedback and Edit Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) model training. Edit Reward Model (RM) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model are initialized from the Edit SFT Model. Each dataset is split into 95% train and 5% validation. Prompt templates are available in Appendix and further details are in Appendix G. Feedback SFT We perform SFT on the Feedback Demonstration dataset. We train for 1 epoch (with 1,858 steps of global batch size of 128) and save checkpoints every 200 steps. The checkpoint with best validation performance is at step 1,400. Edit SFT We perform SFT on the Edit Demonstration dataset. We train on 1 epoch (with 385 steps of global batch size of 128) and save checkpoint every 100 steps. The checkpoint with best validation performance is at step 385. Edit RM We perform Bradley-Terry modeling (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022) on the Edit Preference dataset. We train up to 1 epoch (94 steps of global batch size 128) and save checkpoint every 10 steps. The checkpoint with the lowest validation loss is at step 80. While the dataset is leaning small, we kept to 1 epoch because Bradley-Terry (BT) style Reward Models over-fit when trained beyond (Wang et al., 2024a; Zhu et al., 2024). One design we implemented was that each step only contains 32 distinct prompt-initial-response-feedback tuples with one pair of (bad edit, good edit) and another pair of (no edit, good edit). Compared to having (bad edit, good edit) and (no edit, good edit) pairs in separate global batches, this setting led to slightly lower validation loss and higher validation accuracy. We believe this is advantageous to support the RM to jointly optimize for good edits against bad and no edits in one backward pass, while preventing multiple gradient updates from having identical good edit samples in separate global batches, which risks over-fitting BT RMs. Edit RL Following Wang et al. (2024a), we perform REINFORCE Leave One Out (Ahmadian et al., 2024) on the Edit SFT model guided by the Edit RM. We train up to 1 epoch (47 steps of global/rollout batch size of 64) and save checkpoint every 5 steps. We select the checkpoint at step 45 which shows best validation performance."

Higher is better for all metrics, except Length. To better understand the contribution of each system component, we conduct few ablation studies: Self-Feedback and Self-Edit First, we want to probe the value of having Feedback-Edit loop over the initial model responses. To do this, we replace the dedicated Feedback and Edit models with Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct prompted similarly. As seen in Table 4, the Self-Feedback and Self-Edit setup perform better on both AlpacaEval (57.6 to 64.6) and MT Bench (8.98 to 9.11) but worse on Arena Hard (85.0 to 84.6) when compared with just the initial Llama-3.1-Nemotron70B -Instruct model. We believe this difference is because AlpacaEval has simple prompts (e.g. How did US states get their names?) while Arena Hard has very challenging prompts (e.g. how does memory affect performance of aws lambda written in nodejs) with MT Bench in between in terms of difficulty. This suggests that simply prompting general instructionfollowing LLM to improve responses does not work well on challenging prompts, underpinning the importance of training dedicated feedback and edit models. We also note that the Self-Feedback model tends to give much longer feedback (around 4 to 5 times as many characters) compared to the trained Feedback model, often encouraging to generate more details (see examples in Appendix and J). As result, Self-Feedback and Self-Edit setup give substantially longer responses (3587.0 characters compared to the initial model with 2199.8). Feedback and Self-Edit To better understand whether general Instruct models such as Llama-3.1Nemotron-70B-Instruct are constrained by their ability to give effective feedback or to edit initial responses based on the given feedback, we conduct separate ablation using the trained Feedback model and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct prompted to self-edit given the feedback. Note that using prompted Self-Feedback model with an Edit model is not practical since the feedback given by Llama3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct is substantially different from the distribution that the Edit model was trained on, since self-feedback is 3-4 times longer (see examples in Appendix and J). Relative to the Feedback and Edit set-up, there is an increase in AlpacaEval (62.8 to 66.2) but substantial drop in MT Bench (9.16 to 8.94) and Arena Hard (87.0 to 85.4). This suggests that prompted Self-Edit models struggle with editing based on given feedback to medium or hard prompts, stressing the value of dedicated Edit model. In addition, we noticed some unexpected behavior when prompting Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct to edit responses based on feedback. It sometimes starts with prefix like Heres the edited response: or Im glad to hear that the response was helpful. Further, it occasionally plans what to do based on the feedback or provides multiple alternative edits (when the edited answer is short). Such behaviors might not be useful to end users who expect straightforward model responses, similar to the responses before applying the edits. Removing RL from Edit Training We introduce RL for training the Edit Model because we observe that the SFT-only Edit frequently (around 30%) leaves the response entirely unchanged, even though clear areas for improvement are mentioned in the provided feedback. Post-RL, we see that such plain repetition no longer occur, which also leads to an increase in mean response length on MT Bench (from 2284.4 to 2614.4 characters). We see that the medium-difficulty MT Bench increases from 9.12 to 9.16 and high-difficulty Arena Hard increases from 86.4 to 87.0 while the low-difficulty AlpacaEval slightly drops from 64.4 to 62.8, which is likely an effect of the length-correction penalty due to the slightly longer length. Importance of Feedback Finally, we want to understand whether feedback is helpful for grounding edits, drawing from Ji et al. (2024). We train an Edit SFT1 model using exactly the same data and hyper-parameters while excluding feedback and slightly changing the prompt template accordingly (see Appendix B). Relative to the Feedback + Edit w/o RL setup, Edit w/o Feedback has similar performance on MT Bench (9.12 vs. 9.14) but higher score on easy prompts in AlpacaEval (64.4 vs. 67.4) and lower score on challenging prompts It is critical to in Arena Hard (86.4 vs. 84.5). note that the Edit w/o Feedback setup achieves an even lower score on Arena Hard (84.5) compared to Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct alone (85.0). Such an observation agrees with Ji et al. (2024) which found that training an Edit model without feedback to be useful on improving AlpacaEval 2 LC of GPT-4-Turbo from 55.0 to 58.3%, although our improvement is substantially larger (57.6 to 67.4%). Together, this suggests that feedback is not beneficial for simple tasks (e.g. straightforward open-ended question answering) similar to 1RL training is not feasible because we dont have signal on what good edit is vs. bad edit since goodness is based on how relevant the edits are to the feedback. in Fig. 2, scaling from 2 to 16 initial responses per prompt leads to an increase in Arena Hard from 89.0 (95% CI: -1.4, 1.2) to 90.2 (95% CI: -1.6, 1.2). This suggests that the Feedback-Edit setup is complementary to Best-of-N sampling. Effective Feedback per Response Our baseline setup in Sec. 3.1 generates 10 feedback per response. However, when looking carefully into the feedback, we find that many feedback describe the quality of the response but do not provide constructive criticism (i.e. areas that can be improved to make the response better). This means that there are often fewer than three actionable suggestions for the Edit model to act upon. Concretely, we estimate there to be around two effective feedback. To solve this issue, we increase the number of feedback generated and re-rank feedback based on heuristic: the number of constructive criticism keywords2 they contain. Therefore, we generate 16, 32 and 64 feedback respectively to obtain 4, 8 and 16 effective feedback. In addition, we find that when generating at the same temperature of 0.7, there are very few differentiated feedback beyond 16 samples. Therefore, for 32 feedback, we generate 16 with temperature 0.7 and 16 with temperature 0.6; for 64 feedback, we generate 16 feedback for each temperature - 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.83. Scaling from 2 to 16 effective feedback increases Arena Hard from 87.0 (95% CI: -1.5, 1.7) to 89.0 (95% CI: -1.5, 1.3). Edited Responses per Feedback set We explore generating up to 16 edits per Feedback set. This means that given the prompt, original response, feedback, we generate up to 16 edited responses with temperature 0.7 and top 0.9 and then pick the one with the highest reward from Llama-3.1Nemotron-70B-Reward. Scaling from 2 to 16 edits increases Arena Hard from 88.4 (95% CI: -1.7, 1.2) to 89.6 (95% CI: -1.4, 1.3). Scaling multiple axes simultaneously Based on Fig. 2, we chose to scale up responses per prompt and effective feedback per response, which seem to be more promising than edits per feedback set. Given compute constraints, we were only able to scale up to 8 responses with 16 effective feedback each. This means generating about 16 times as many tokens as one would with the default greedy generation, similar to the Best-of-N 16 re2However, improve, lack, benefit, but 3Even lower temperatures loses diversity while even higher temperature leads to frequent hallucinations Figure 2: Feedback and Edit Models enable effective Inference-Time scaling across various dimensions. those in AlpacaEval but is advantageous for more challenging tasks (e.g. solving complex real-world code tasks) in Arena Hard which requires more targeted feedback for the model to make meaningful improvements. To concretely demonstrate the utility of diverse feedback for challenging tasks, we include select generated feedback in Appendix J."

            "content": "While dedicated Feedback and Edit models can benefit model performance used at small scale during inference-time, greater value can be unleashed by scaling up various aspects of this system. Here, we show it can be scaled at inference time by increasing the number of initial responses per prompt, effective feedback per response and edited responses per feedback set. To illustrate such capability (within compute constraint), we focus on the Arena Hard task as it is the most challenging. Best-of-N (Baseline) We perform Best-of-N Sampling, which involves temperature-sampling multiple times and using Reward Model to pick the best generation. We generate up to 16 responses using Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct using temperature 0.7 and top 0.9 and then choose the response that has the highest reward from Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward (NVIDIA, 2024b), top performing reward model on RewardBench (AllenAI, 2024). From Fig. 2, scaling from Best of 2 to Best of 16 increases Arena Hard from 86.4 (95% CI: -1.8, 1.7) to 88.5 (95% CI: -1.2, 1.5). Initial Responses per Prompt We take each of these 16 responses from Best-of-N sampling and individually pass them through the Feedback-Edit system. Finally, we take the 16 edited responses and choose one with the highest reward as scored by Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward. As shown sponses setup. Our setup achieves an Arena Hard of 91.0 (95% CI: -1.0, 1.2), meaning that it outperforms Best-of-N 16 at 88.5 (95% CI: -1.2, 1.5). Finally, qualitative inspection suggests that Llama3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward model was not always optimal for selecting the best response. Therefore, after the conclusion of our initial experiments, we attempted to use an alternative recently-released Llama-3.3-Nemotron-70B-Select model (NVIDIA, 2025) instead, which reaches Arena Hard of 92.7 (95% CI: -1.2, 0.9). This surpasses both OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 at 90.4 (95% CI: -1.1, 1.3) (LMSys, 2024) and DeepSeek R1 at 92.3 (95% CI: unreported) (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025)."

            "content": "Inspired by DeepSeek-AI et al. (2025), we investigate whether data generated from the FeedbackEdit system can be used to train models to generate better responses zero-shot (i.e. without using the scaling system at inference time). Data We use all unique first-turn prompts from the Feedback Demonstration dataset (totaling 22, 644 with 21, 850 train and 794 val). We only use first-turn prompts due to practical constraints to minimize prefix lengths for generation throughput. In addition, we used vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023), specialized inference framework in order to substantially increase generation throughput. We apply the optimal multi-axes scaling setup with Llama3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct as the initial response model from Section 6. Model Training We use Llama 3.3 70B Instruct model (Llama, 2024) and Llama-3.1-Nemotron70B-Instruct (NVIDIA, 2024a) to initialize training. We perform SFT for 1 epoch (with 170 steps of global batch size of 128) and save checkpoints every 10 steps. The checkpoint with best validation performance is at steps 150 and 160 respectively. Evaluation Metrics follows Section 3.1 - Metrics. Further training details in Appendix G. MT Bench (GPT-4-Turbo) Length (Chars.)

Higher is better for all metrics, except Length. Results Table 5 shows that Distillation can improve upon both initial models across MT-Bench, AlpacaEval and Arena Hard, although the improvements are generally lower compared to when the Feedback-Edit system is optimally applied at inference-time (see Table 3 and Fig. 2). Notably, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct has substantial increase in AlpacaEval (35.0 to 61.6) and Arena Hard (62.4 to 88.8), indicating the effectiveness of the distillation process. Together, this suggests that the Feedback-Edit system can be useful for generating data to train models useful in applications that are latency/cost-sensitive, while even greater benefits can be reaped in other tasks that can scale at inference time."

            "title": "Ethical Considerations",
            "content": "Societal Impact Beyond general alignment improvements discussed in the main paper, our Feedback-Edit Inference-Time Scaling approach brings along additional advantages that may enable more to develop and use advanced AI systems with higher customization, improved ease-ofdeployment, lower latency and innate capacity for personalization. First, the Feedback-Edit system offers finegrained control over how much inference-time compute to use, by controlling the number of initial responses per prompt, feedback per response and edited responses per feedback set. Second, Feedback and Edit models can be served in disaggregated manner rather than on the same compute resource - which is necessary for monolithic models (e.g. DeepSeek R1 with over 600B parameters). Third, when performing scaling, sampling multiple candidates at each stage - initial responses, feedback and edited responses - can be done in parallel. This means that the overall system only has about 2 times the latency as greedy generation, since the initial response and edited response take similar time and feedback are much shorter and can be generated very quickly. On the other hand, thinking tokens from models such as DeepSeek R1 have to be generated sequentially. This leads to much higher latency upper-bounds, especially if model thinks with many more tokens than it responds with, which is not uncommon. Finally, using feedback that are human interpretable and selectable opens new research avenues for personalized alignment of models. Users can potentially choose model-generated feedback that is most in line with their own preferences. Such feedback can then be used to ground the Edit model to make changes based on individual preferences in controllable fashion. Licenses The use of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70BInstruct and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward is bound by the Llama 3.1 Community License Agreement while the use of Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct is bound by the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement. We use both models in accordance with their license and intended use. Human Annotations Annotators were contracted by vendors Scale AI and Translated, which completed ethical review prior to the start of data collection. Consent for use of data for model training was obtained from all annotators through our vendors. Both Scale AI and Translated implemented several measures to prevent annotators from using LLMs as part of the annotation workflow. Scale AI engages the Anker Methodology, GISC Impact Sourcing Standard, and UN Sustainable Development Goals to provide fair and competitive pay. The specific pay is calculated based on many factors, including the specific project, the specialized skillset and expertise required, regional costs of living and then transparently listed on Scale AI platform. Scale AI also provides multiple channels for questions and support, including 24/7 support teams, community discussion channels with specially trained moderators, and speak up hotline where contractors can report concerns anonymously. Worker concerns can be submitted to and are reviewed by the support team, and pay disputes are reviewed by support specialists trained in this area. Translated has active annotators on the platform earn at least their local minimum wage, with systems in place to ensure that annotators were paid in timely manner for all the work they completed. Translated also has measures to avoid unreasonable levels of competition between annotators, as well as overwork. These measures include restricting sign-ups of new annotators as well as matching annotators with jobs on the platform, thereby reducing unpaid labour time spent on looking for jobs. In addition, Translated has active measures to protect annotators from work-related health and safety risks. Translated engages annotators with contracts that are written in clear language, accessible to annotators, consistent with annotators terms of engagement on the platform, and that contracts do not contain clause requiring annotators to waive their right to legal recourse. Annotators can communicate with human platform representative from Translated and there are officially documented and effective processes for annotators to appeal decisions such as bad reviews and ratings, or disciplinary actions. Translated also has policy to mitigate the risk of discrimination against annotators by the platform or clients."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "The current approach for sampling multiple feedback, filtering out feedback that find the response perfectly helpful and re-ranking feedback based on the number of words relating to constructive criticism is not compute-optimal. Techniques such as constrained decoding or involving other logit manipulation methods to incentivize decoding feedback with more constructive criticism may make such sampling more compute-efficient. Data collection prompts sourced from ShareGPT (RyokoAI, 2023) and WildChat (Zhao et al., 2024) capture user queries collected before April 2023 and April 2024, respectively. The upper-bound of prompt complexity has since increased, as underlying systems have become more capable. Furthermore, ShareGPT and WildChat prompts requiring responses longer than 2000 words, or exceeding 4,000 word input (across all user and assistant turns) were skipped altogether, as longer responses/prompts require more effort from annotators, which were outside of the scope that we had contractually agreed with our vendors. We also skipped prompts requiring access to knowledge after July 2024. Given this, results of this study may not fully demonstrate the types of complex or difficult queries that may benefit from Feedback and Edit Models . There is some risk that readers might interpret our Feedback-Edit system as the only useful method for Inference-Time Scaling. We believe this to be misunderstanding of our contributions. Instead, we believe that different Inference-Time Scaling methods are beneficial for different settings and can complement each other in many scenarios."

            "title": "B Prompt Templates",
            "content": "Coding and Multilingual We first identify the programming or natural language required for responding to each first-turn-user-prompt by prompting Nemotron 4 340B Instruct (Nvidia et al., 2024) with prompt templates in Appendix B. Such identification is not always perfect and sometimes leads to confusion on the expected response - for instance responding with particular frameworks (e.g. Flask, Pandas or React) instead of the specific language (Python or Javascript). Prompts involving HTML, CSS or Javascript commonly require knowledge of all three languages and hence we combine into one language - Javascript/HTML/CSS. For natural languages, the LLM occasionally responses with the language name in the language itself (e.g. Español instead of Spanish). To solve such confusion, we manually map such occasions to the correct language name. Despite our best efforts, there are rare situations in which the language is misclassified and we ask our vendor to skip such tasks during annotations. Finally, we stratified sample prompts based on the language. Proportions are primarily determined based on the number of prompts available for each language in the ShareGPT dataset (RyokoAI, 2023). This means that we allocate higher proportion to commonly used languages such as Python and Chinese. General and STEM We first exclude prompts that involve languages other than English (directly or by mentioning the keyword translate), require code response, or are shorter than 10 characters since these messages tend to be some variant of Hi/Hello. We also exclude prompts that ask about the Chatbots identity or contains keywords relating to OpenAI or ChatGPT, as these are commonly identity-related prompts that are not relevant for our purpose. As note, we do not classify prompts into STEM and General prompts since STEM is relatively broad term. Instead, our vendor manually classifies prompts and routes STEM prompts to suitable STEM specialist annotators subsequently. Following Wang et al.

            "content": "Prompt: Tourism marriage Initial Response: Tourism marriage, also known as tourism wedding or destination wedding, refers to the practice of couples traveling to different location, often popular tourist destination, to get married. Here are some key aspects of tourism marriages: 1. **Destination**: Couples choose destination that holds special meaning to them or is place theyve always wanted to visit. Popular destinations include beaches, mountains, historic sites, or even exotic locations abroad. 2. **Intimacy**: Tourism marriages often involve smaller group of guests compared to traditional weddings. This can make the event more intimate and personal. 3. **Combination of Wedding and Honeymoon**: Many couples choose to have their honeymoon in the same location as their wedding, saving time and money. 4. **Unique Experiences**: Couples can incorporate local culture, traditions, or unique activities into their wedding, making it memorable experience for everyone involved. 5. **Planning**: Planning tourism marriage can be more complex than local wedding. It often involves coordinating with vendors from afar, understanding local marriage laws, and managing travel logistics for guests. 6. **Cost**: Depending on the location and number of guests, tourism marriage can sometimes be less expensive than traditional wedding. However, it can also be more expensive, especially if the couple is covering travel costs for guests. 7. **Legal Considerations**: Its important for couples to understand the legal requirements for getting married in their chosen destination. Some countries have residency requirements or other regulations that could impact the wedding plans. 8. **Impact on Local Economy**: Tourism marriages can have positive impact on the local economy, as they bring in visitors who will use local services and attractions. Here are few popular destinations for tourism marriages: - Hawaii, USA - Bali, Indonesia - Tuscany, Italy - Cancun, Mexico - Santorini, Greece - The Caribbean Islands - Las Vegas, USA - Paris, France - Bora Bora, French Polynesia - Kyoto, Japan Feedback: 1. The response is mostly helpful. Even though the prompt does not clearly specify the context, the model makes good effort to return sensible response by talking about what tourism marriages or destination weddings mean, key aspects of tourism marriages, and some popular destinations for tourism marriages as per recent trends. 2. The response is mostly helpful. It defines tourism marriage, explains key aspects of tourism marriage, and names popular destinations. Some of the information the model chooses to include is generic and not necessary to write out - for example, the idea that traveling for destination wedding can lead to unique experiences as its own bullet point is not necessary. 3. (Excluded to Edit Model) The response is perfectly helpful to the user. It explains what tourism marriage is and gives other names that are used for it. The response gives several details that make up tourism marriage and what they usually entail. Overall, the response is clear and understandable, giving the user full explanation of the topic.

MT Bench consists of 80 multi-turn questions, each consisting of an initial question and follow-up question, for total of 160 prompts. Questions are collated from 8 categories: Reasoning, Math, Coding, STEM, Writing, Roleplay, Extraction and Humanities/Social Science. Responses are first generated greedily with up to 1024 tokens (default value for MT Bench). The responses to these prompts are evaluated by GPT-4-0125-Preview to give score between 1 and 10, and the mean across all prompts is reported. Prompts in Coding, Math and Reasoning categories are evaluated with reference correct answer, which were generated by the judge model and then manually verified to be correct. Higher MT Bench score indicates better instruction following ability. AlpacaEval 2.0 Length Controlled We follow Dong et al. (2024); Meng et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2024a) to use AlpacaEval 2.0 Length Controlled (Dubois et al., 2024). AlpacaEval 2.0 contains 805 first-turn instructions (relating to singularrequirement, straightforward tasks such as recommendations, question answering, and open-ended writing). An answer to each prompt is greedily generated up to 2048 tokens by the evaluated model as well as baseline model (GPT-4-1106-turbo), which are then sent to GPT-4-1106-turbo evaluator that outputs the probability of preferring the generations of the evaluated model. Finally, the authors introduced length correction factor to mitigate the bias for the evaluator towards preferring longer generations. Arena Hard We follow Dong et al. (2024); Meng et al.

This evaluation is based on the responses strengths and weaknesses in addressing the prompt for literature review on AI and Patient Care Optimization. On the positive side, the response: Provides clear and concise structure for literature review, including an introduction, themed sections, and conclusion. Covers range of relevant topics within the field, such as diagnostic accuracy, personalized medicine, workflow optimization, patient engagement, and ethical considerations. Includes formatted reference list, albeit with fictional citations due to the nature of the prompt. However, the response falls short in several key areas, limiting its overall helpfulness: Lack of Real-World Citations: The use of fictional citations (e.g., \"Char, D. S., et al. (2018)\") hinders the responses practical utility, as readers cannot pursue the referenced studies. Superficial Depth: The discussion of each topic is brief and lacks the in-depth analysis typically expected in literature review, failing to provide nuanced insights or critically evaluate the studies. Absence of Methodological Details: The response does not outline the methodology used for the literature search, selection criteria, or how the themes were identified, which are crucial components of comprehensive literature review. No Clear Implications or Future Research Directions: Beyond general call for addressing ethical challenges, the response does not clearly articulate implications for practice, policy, or future research avenues, which would enhance its helpfulness for readers seeking to apply the knowledge. et al., 2024).
