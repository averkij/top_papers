            "content": "In-context learning (ICL) (Brown et al., 2020) has emerged as powerful paradigm enabling diverse applications without parameter updates in large language models (LLMs). By conditioning on inputoutput examples that demonstrate specific task, LLMs can generate predictions while maintaining fixed parameters. While in-context learning has been extensively studied for LLMs (Xu et al., 2023; Min et al., 2022a; Dong et al., 2024), its potential for retriever models remains unexplored. We study how in-context examples can be effectively leveraged to enhance performance in retriever models. Unlike in decoder-only LLMs where in-context examples expand model capacity at generation time, in-context examples may primarily provide task-relevant information rather than increasing model capacity. Specifically, we study injecting in-context examples to build dense retriever model (Karpukhin et al., 2020) which embeds queries and documents into shared representational space for efficient search over large corpus. Text retrieval is core component of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, serving as key component for retrieval-augmented language language models (Lewis et al., 2021). State-of-the-art retriever models started to leverage decoder-only models as backbone (Wang et al., 2024b; BehnamGhader et al., 2024; Muennighoff et al., 2024; Meng et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024a), further motivating our study of applying in-context examples. We begin by naively prepending in-context examples to the target query and provide it to existing retriever models (BehnamGhader et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Meng et al., 2024), observing that this leads to significant performance drop. We propose new approach to construct retrieval models that can leverage in-context examples, which we name as RARe: Retrieval Augmented Retrieval with In-Context Examples. Our approach modifies the query format of retrieval systems by providing in-context examples whose query is semantically similar to the target query. Then, we apply standard continued fine-tuning with contrastive loss. We conduct comprehensive initializing from both evaluation of new query format across various experimental settings, Equal advising Figure 1: Overview Prior work augments task-specific instruction to given query as input to the Retriever. In RARe, we further leverage set of in-context exemplars that contain pairs of queries and relevant documents. These in-context examples are augmented with the original query as input to the retriever along with the instruction. decoder-only checkpoints and pre-trained retriever model checkpoints. We demonstrate that RARe outperforms baseline models across multiple tasks, achieving up to +1.41% nDCG@10 on standard retrieval benchmarks (Thakur et al., 2021) and demonstrating even larger gains (+2.72%) on reasoning-oriented retrieval tasks (Xiao et al., 2024). Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We introduce RARe, an approach that adapts pre-trained checkpoints to use in-context examples for retrieval. We demonstrate that this recipe can improve the performance of various base architectures, including decoder-only models and existing retriever models. We provide detailed analyses on how the quality, quantity, and selection of in-context examples affect performance, contextualizing the sources of our experimental gains. All our code and model checkpoints are publicly released."

            "content": "Base Models We explore two training setups: fine-tuning decoder-only models for retrieval, and fine-tuning existing retriever models. For the first setup, we train the Llama-3 family of models, 3 following the training methodology outlined by Ma et al. (2023); Weller et al. (2024b). For the second setup, we use two high-performing publicly available embedding models that were trained with task-specific instructions: LLM2Vec-Llama-3-8b-Supervised (BehnamGhader et al., 2024) and E5-Mistral-Instruct (Wang et al., 2024b). We chose these two models because, unlike some other strong performers (Meng et al., 2024; de Souza P. Moreira et al., 2024), they were not trained on most of the datasets used in our downstream benchmarks. The LLM2Vec-Llama-3-8b-Supervised model is initially trained using an unsupervised text reconstruction objective and then fine-tuned with supervised contrastive learning on public subset of the E5 dataset, which incorporates various supervised training datasets (Gao et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2016; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). In contrast, E5-Mistral-Instruct undergoes further training on synthetic data that is not publicly available. These models are chosen to assess the impact of additional supervised training on an existing retriever model versus training generative model for retrieval from scratch. Training Data For fine-tuning existing retriever models, we follow prior work (BehnamGhader et al., 2024) and train on publicly available portion of E5 dataset (Springer et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b), which contains MS-MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) NLI (Gao et al., 2021), ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019), FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), Quora Duplication Questions (DataCanary et al., 2017). For finetuning decoder-only models from scratch, we use the MS-MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) passage ranking dataset and train without task-specific instruction prefix, following Ma et al. (2023). Constructing In-Context Examples During training, we provide each training example with five in-context examples from the dataset that it belongs to (k=5). Specifically, the set of examples Dic for each task is drawn from the training set Di, Dic ."

            "title": "4.2 EVALUATION",
            "content": "Datasets We evaluate on the widely used BeIR retrieval benchmark (Thakur et al., 2021). For ablative experiments, we follow prior work and focus on low-resource datasets (Wang et al., 2023) that potentially benefit more from few-shot examples. Since the BeIR benchmark contains few datasets whose training sets are in the E5 dataset mixutre, we categorize them as in-domain and out-of-domain i.e. not seen during training. See Table 7 in the Appendix for list of in-domain and out-of-domain datasets from BeIR. We also evaluate on subset of the RAR-b (Xiao et al., 2024) benchmark, which requires complex reasoning for retrievers. Specifically, we evaluate on HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), ARC-C (Clark et al., 2018), TempReasonL1 (Tan et al., 2023), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), α-NLI (Bhagavatula et al., 2020), SiQA (Sap et al., 2019), and Quail (Rogers et al., 2020). Unlike BeIR, some RAR-b queries are composed of sentences with (multiple) indicators (e.g., Start:, End:). Each dataset is associated with task-specific instruction, following prior work (Muennighoff et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024b; BehnamGhader et al., 2024). We provide additional preprocessing details in Appendix A. Constructing In-Context Examples We construct Dic test from the training/development set of each datasets. For datasets on BeIR that do not have either of these, we use synthetically generated collection of document-query pairs (GenQ) from Thakur et al. (2021). For all experiments, we use k=5 in-context examples. Metrics We use standard metrics for retrieval benchmarks. Following Thakur et al. (2021), we report nDCG@10, which measures the ranking quality of the top 10 retrieved documents, taking into account both the relevance and position of each retrieved document (Wang et al., 2013)."

            "content": "We evaluate in-context example augmented queries in three settings. First, we evaluate the performance after inference-only modification, where we take existing pre-trained retrievers and simply provide in-context examples at inference time (Section 5). Second, we evaluate training retriever with in-context examples from an LLM (decoder-only) backbone (Section 5.1). Third, we compare training retriever models with in-context examples from pre-trained retriever (Section 5.2). 4 Figure 2: Inference-only modification does not work Performance after adding in-context examples to the query without updating model parameters. We see that embedding models are not able to leverage in-context examples out of the box, as opposed to decoder-only models. Inference-only Modification Figure 2 illustrates the impact of incorporating in-context examples at inference time. Here, we simply modify the query format with retrieved in-context examples (i.e. qinst+ic, Eq. 4) at inference time and compare its performance with the query format that does not have retrieved in-context examples (i.e. qinst, Eq. 1). We evaluate the performance on three retriever models: SFR-Embedding-2-R (Meng et al., 2024), LLM2Vec-Llama-3-8B-Supervised (BehnamGhader et al., 2024), and E5-Mistral-7B-Instruct (Wang et al., 2024b). Unlike in autoregressive LLMs, these embedding models generally exhibit decreased performance when in-context examples are added, with LLM2Vec-Llama-3-8B-Supervised showing the largest drops in performance, except on one dataset (SciFact), where 2 out of 3 models show marginal gains over providing only instructions. Our experiments, which include adding more in-context examples and using nearest-neighbor examples, extend the findings of Muennighoff et al. (2024), where in-context examples led to decrease in performance on the GritLM models. Table 1: Training from decoder-only (LLM) checkpoint. Performance is measured by nDCG@10.

As these initial checkpoints have already been trained on the training dataset, the extent that retrievers adapt to new query format can be limited. Comparison Systems We first report the initial retriever performance (Base) without any modification. Then, we compare continued fine-tuning with the task-specific instruction query format (Eq. 1) which only prepends the task specific instruction (Instruct, qinst) to our in-context example augmented query format (Eq. 4). Results Table 2 reports experimental results in this setting. Overall, both fine-tuning approaches provides gains over the base checkpoints. Comparing two settings, Instruct (qinst) vs. RARe (qinst+ic), our method achieves notable improvement with E5-Mistral-Instruct base model (1.95% over Instruct on out-of-domain tasks, and 1.32% overall). Our method performs similar to Instruct (qinst) setting when trained with the LLM2Vec base model. It is hard to attribute why experimental results varies based on the base retriever checkpoint, but we note the following differences between the two models. LLM2Vec-Llama-3-8b-Supervised is the only model in our experiments where further fine-tuning with only instructions led to decrease in in-domain performance. E5-Mistral-Instruct employs causal attention with last token pooling, and trains on proprietary synthetic dataset, LLM2Vec-Llama-3-8b-Supervised uses bidirectional attention with mean pooling, training only on the E5 public portion. The effectiveness of learning with in-context examples may depend on the model architecture or data setting, and further investigation can be explored in future work."

(Random, Retrieved) shows second best overall performance, and generally outperforms (Random, Random), suggesting retrieved examples during evaluation is advantageous even when trained with randomly paired in-context examples. Our findings align with prior work in in-context learning that the incorporation of semantically similar examples is beneficial (Agrawal et al., 2022; Rubin et al., 2022). Does Having Semantically Relevant In-Context Example Help? For some test examples, augmented in-context examples are very relevant, and for others, much less so. In this section, we group the evaluation examples by the maximum similarity of in-context query and the test query measured by an off-the-shelf sentence embedding model (Score@Top-1).2 and plot the performances for each group. Figure 4 presents the performance of our system (RARe) and baseline (Instruct). On NFCorpus and SciFact datasets, we observe that when the closest in-context example has high similarity with the target query, RARe demonstrates over 10% gains compared to the base model. On the other hand, fine-tuning exhibits relatively lower performance gains with increasing similarity thresholds. For ArguAna, and FiQA2018, RARes gains with increasing Score@Top-1 are less pronounced, but generally matches the performance of the base model. How Many In-Context Examples Are Sufficient? We analyze the performance of RARe when varying the number of in-context examples provided during training and inference. Table 3 shows that increasing the number of in-context examples generally enhances performance. On ArguAna, we observe that 0 examples are optimal, which is likely due to the mismatch in the lengths of the queries used as in-context examples3 (which are significantly shorter) versus the actual test queries. However, the impact is not uniformly positive across all datasets, suggesting that the optimal number of in-context examples may be dataset-dependent. We observe similar trends when we fix the number of in-context examples to five during training and vary the number of examples provided during inference, which are provided in Table 12 in the Appendix. 2https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 3https://huggingface.co/datasets/BeIR/arguana-generated-queries 7 Table 3: Impact of the number of in-context examples (k) during training and evaluation.

Ablating Content and Format of In-context Examples One can view in-context examples as form of query expansion (Lv & Zhai, 2009; Wang et al., 2023), providing useful keywords to improve the performance. In Table 4, we analyze the impact of various formats of in-context examples. All models are trained with the same format that they are evaluated on. Query-Only and Doc-Only contain only queries and documents of in-context examples, respectively. For ShuffleC, we randomly shuffle the mapping between and d. On the other hand, for Shuffle-NC, we do not assume any structure, meaning that query can be followed by query as well as document. First, we observe that Query-Only shows larger performance drop over Doc-Only, suggesting incontext documents might contain more useful contents than in-context queries. Second, we observe that shuffling the pairings (Shuffle-C) marginally hurts in-context learning in RARe, as opposed to Shuffle-NC. Our findings align with prior study in decoder-only models (Min et al., 2022b) which showed strict correspondence between and is not required for performance gains from in-context examples.

Table 5 presents the downstream performance comparison between RARe variants trained solely on positive examples and those trained with augmented negative documents. The results indicate no performance gains from including negative documents.

            "content": "In Table 6, we present breakdown of the latency of each stage of the retrieval pipeline for both baseline (qinst) and in-context (qinst+ic) settings. We measure the total time required to obtain nearest-neighbour in-context examples (NN) from BM25, compute query embeddings (Query), and perform search with FAISS (Douze et al., 2024) with encoded query embeddings on the pre-computed document index (Search). We observe that the largest contributing factors to latency are the average length of input queries (Avg len.), and the size of the index (# Corpus). For large query length and small corpus sizes, the in-context setting demonstrates significant increase in total latency (19.40-40.04 for FiQA2018 and NFCorpus, respectively). However, for smaller average query lengths, this latency diminishes, as seen for Quora (1.38) and DBPedia (1.21). Moreover, the added latency due to the in-context setting also diminishes when the corpus size grows, as the time required for search outweighs the time to encode the query. For example, on Touche2020 with larger corpus of 380K documents, the increase in latency is 4.76 compared to FiQA2018 (19.40) for similar query lengths."

            "title": "7 RELATED WORK",
            "content": "In-context learning ICL (Brown et al., 2020) allows models to adapt to new tasks in few-shot manner by conditioning on the input data and the context provided at inference time. ICL has been effectively applied to wide range of tasks such as classification (Milios et al., 2023), translation (Zhu et al., 2024), mathematical reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022), and code generation (Li et al., 2023a). Recent advancements have enhanced the ICL capabilities of language models through additional training procedures (Huang et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2024). Min et al. (2022a) and Chen et al. (2022) perform meta-learning with in-context examples on wide collection of tasks, with the goal of adapting to new task at inference time through few-shot in-context examples. Other works have explored improving performance through more principled approaches to select in-context examples during inference (Zhang et al., 2022; Sorensen et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024c; Qin et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024c). simple and popular approach is to retrieve examples that are most similar to the input (Liu et al., 2022; Rubin et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023c). Providing in-context examples to re-ranking models has been studied in prior work (Drozdov et al., 2023), but the potential of augmenting retrievers themselves by leveraging in-context examples remains unexplored. Muennighoff et al. (2024) explored providing an in-context example out-of-the-box, but showed an overall decrease in performance compared to zero-shot inference. 9 Retrieval Large language models pre-trained with autoregressive setups (Jiang et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) have shown remarkable performance when adapted to retrieval tasks (Wang et al., 2024b; BehnamGhader et al., 2024), outperforming encoder-style retrievers (Izacard et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024a). Despite these advancements, challenge that remains is the ability to tailor retrieval systems to specific tasks or queries. To address this, recent line of work explores incorporating instructions into retrieval by training models to use task-specific instructions along with the query (Su et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2023). Oh et al. (2024) and Weller et al. (2024a) further propose using instructions that are specific to each query. Another well-established technique in retrieval is query expansion (Jagerman et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2024), where the query is augmented with additional terms to enrich the embedding as form of relevance feedback (Lv & Zhai, 2009). Recent efforts have focused on applying LLMs to expand the original query before retrieval (Wang et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024). These techniques are not mutually exclusive, and can be integrated with our approach."

            "title": "8 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "In this paper, we explored augmenting in-context examples to retrieval models. Building on the limitations of existing retriever models in following in-context examples, we introduced RARe, simple strategy that equips retrievers with the ability to leverage in-context examples by training with semantically similar in-context examples. Through detailed experiments and analyses, we demonstrated that RARe consistently improves performance across various architectures and downstream retrieval tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of in-context learning for retriever models."

        {
            "title": "9 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK",
            "content": "+ Similar to in-context settings in autoregressive models, limitation of our approach is the require- ) pairs at inference time. RARe also ment for set of in-context examples in the form of (q, introduces additional latency at inference time due to the encoding of in-context examples in the augmented query. This latency becomes more pronounced with longer documents, resulting in correspondingly extended queries. While the overhead is particularly significant for small indexes, it diminishes as the size of the index grows. To address these challenges, future research could explore several avenues, such as using efficient long-context retrievers (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024) as backbone, or developing extractive and/or abstractive compression techniques on incontext documents to reduce query length. In this work, we used BM25 due to its lightweight nature to retrieve nearest neighbour examples. Future work could explore stronger models and approaches to reduce latency. Our current experiments are limited to English-language tasks, with potential to expand the scope to multilingual settings. Future work could explore curating synthetic data, an increasingly popular area of study for embedding models (Lee et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024b; Weller et al., 2024b), but for training with in-context examples. Future work could also explore developing new contrastive objectives to provide better signals during training with in-context examples."

We use sequence length of 512 for documents and 1024 for queries as in-context augmented queries are longer. For RARe we use mixture of 70% examples with in-context examples and 30% without Table 16. (E5-Mistral-Instruct, LLM2Vec-Llama-3-8BWhen fine-tuning existing retriever models Supervised), we follow setting similar to BehnamGhader et al. (2024). We train on 8 H100 GPUs with largest possible per-device batch size of 32 along with 2 gradient accumulation steps. We consider random subset of 100K examples from the public E5 dataset mixture (Springer et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b). We use learning rate of 2e-4, maximum sequence length 1024, warmup ratio 0.1 for 1 epoch. For E5-Mistral-Instruct, we apply LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) r=16, and r=4 for LLM2Vec-Llama-3-8B-Supervised since higher rank was leading to severe overfitting on the instruction baseline. A.2 DATA PROCESSING RAR-b Since RAR-b benchmark provides only test split, we parse the original training data for each dataset to use as in-context examples. We exclude datasets without any training splits and 2 datasets that were mixture of multiple tasks or datasets, thereby being difficult to parse. This results in 8 datasets to evaluate on. We preprocess the training split to match the format of RAR-b test split, without excluding any instances. An exception is made for α-NLI, where there were multiple identical instances. Therefore, we removed such duplicates, resulting in 72,046 in-context candidates. Furthermore, some RAR-b queries are composed of sentences with (multiple) indicators (e.g., Start:, End:). To address this, we make minor modification in formatting, enclosing the queries in brackets. The final query representation is qinst+ic = Instruct: {t}; Query: [{qic 1 }]; Document: {dic+ 1 } ; Query: [{q}]. Inference Algorithm Algorithm 2 provides detailed outline of inference with RARe. Promptriever Promptriever(Weller et al., 2024b) employs 10 different prompts and reports the highest score for each dataset. We apply the prompt that works the best (outperforms 5/15 datasets), which is as follows: document that meets these criteria is considered relevant, while document that does not meet these criteria is considered non-relevant."
