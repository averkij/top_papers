            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have led to significant progress across broad spectrum of capabilities, including reasoning (OpenAI et al., 2024b, 2025), instruction following (Zhou et al., 2023; Grattafiori et al., 2024), and visual understanding (Liu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a; Padlewski et al., 2024; Agrawal et al., 2024; Bai *Both authors contributed equally. Corresponding author. 1 et al., 2025). However, as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world and high-stakes applications, evaluating their trustworthiness has become as essential as measuring their task performance. fundamental aspect of this assessment is calibration - ensuring that models expressed confidence aligns with its actual accuracy in real-world scenarios. With the rise of closed-source models that only support text-based interactions, the ability to express uncertainty, similar to human communication verbally, has become particularly crucial for practical applications (Xiong et al., 2024). Although quite few studies have explored eliciting more accurate confidence estimations from LLMs (Lin et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Hager et al., 2025), how these strategies adapt to VLMs remains an open question. Unlike text-only models, VLMs process and integrate information across multiple modalities, introducing new dimensions of complexity in how confidence is expressed and calibrated. This multimodal nature raises three critical challenges: 1) How accurately can VLMs verbalize their confidence? 2) How do instructions embedded within images affect calibration? 3) Does verbalized confidence remain consistent when processing the same information presented in different modalities? These questions highlight gap in current research and underscore the need for deeper investigation into modality-sensitive uncertainty estimation in VLMs. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We present the first comprehensive evaluation of verbalized confidence in diverse set of commercial and open-source VLMs, leveraging widely adopted large-scale multimodal datasets. Our analysis focuses on three evaluation scenarios, with particular focus on the embedded instruction setting and the semantically aligned setting, to investigate how calibration behaviors vary across input modalities. 2) Our results indicate that most VLMs continue to exhibit miscalibration in their verbalized uncertainty. However, visual reasoning models, those capable of thinking with images, show notable improvements in calibration across benchmarks and modalities. These findings point to the promise of visual reasoning-oriented enhancement for verbalized uncertainty estimation. 3) To further improve calibration, we introduce VISUAL CONFIDENCE-AWARE PROMPTING, two-stage strategy that elicits visual-specific confidence before aggregating the final output. Compared to strong baselines such as Top-K prompting and selfreflection, our method yields significant gains in calibration quality. In summary, this work comprehensively evaluates the verbalized calibration in current VLMs, reveals persistent miscalibration issues across modalities, and offers promising direction for enhancing verbalized uncertainty."

            "content": "Quantifying and calibrating uncertainty is key area of research for improving the reliability of LLMs (Fadeeva et al., 2023; Vashurin et al., 2024). variety of techniques have been explored to estimate uncertainty in L(V)LMs, including samplingbased approaches (Kuhn et al., 2023; Nikitin et al., 2024), which approximate uncertainty by drawing from predictive distributions; information-theoretic methods (Fadeeva et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025), which employ measures such as entropy or mutual information; and reflexive approaches (Tian et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024), which investigate how models articulate their own uncertainty through natural language. This work focuses on the reflexive category, specifically examining how VLMs verbalize uncertainty. Verbalized uncertainty offers practical advantages: it eliminates the need for computational overhead associated with sampling or post-hoc calibration, while providing uncertainty assessments that are easily understood by general users (Hager et al., 2025). Prior studies have identified consistent patterns of overconfidence in verbalized uncertainty produced by instruction-tuned models (Xiong et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024). Others have observed that reinforcement learning (RL)- based reasoning can improve calibration across domains, suggesting that RL may induce more reflective and self-aware model outputs (Zeng et al., 2025). While initial analyses of verbalized uncertainty in VLMs have been conducted, primarily on small-scale or object-level datasets (Groot and Valdenegro Toro, 2024; Borszukovszki et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025), broader, systematic evaluation across tasks, domains, and model families remains lacking. Our work addresses this gap through holistic analysis of how VLMs express and calibrate their uncertainty across diverse settings."

However, growing body of research in vision-language (Li et al., 2024b; Mistretta et al., 2025; Shu et al., 2025) and audio-language settings (Chen et al., 2024) has highlighted significant modality misalignment in many current multimodal models. These findings demonstrate systematic failures in cross-modal information integration and generalization. In response, several benchmarks have been proposed to quantify and analyze these performance gaps (Fu et al., 2024). In this work, we extend the analysis to examine how calibration, particularly through verbalized uncertainty, behaves across text and image modalities in VLMs, providing novel insights into both alignment and confidence consistency."

This benchmark encompasses wide array of domains and task formats, providing robust benchmark for verbalized uncertainty.

Factuality: We adopt the Visual SimpleQA benchmark (Wang et al., 2025) to assess models ability to judge factual correctness from visual information, offering direct test of basic visual grounding and confidence estimation. Math Reasoning: To evaluate calibration under visual mathematical reasoning, we employ MathVista (Lu et al., 2024) and MathVision (Wang et al., 2024).

To address this, we adopt the vision-only configuration from MMMU-Pro (Yue et al., 2024), in which entire questions are embedded within images and directly presented to the model. By comparing calibration performance against the general setting, where question bodies are given via text, we assess whether visually embedded instructions introduce additional difficulty for VLMs in producing reliable confidence estimates. 3.1.3 Semantically Aligned Modalities"

For example, mathematical function may appear either as visual diagram or textual equation (see Figure 1). This setup allows us to isolate calibration and reasoning behavior when the content remains constant, but the modality changes. To this end, we use the IsoBench benchmark (Fu et al., 2024), which spans four domains (mathematics, games, science, and algorithms) and is explicitly designed for testing modality alignment. Unlike the embedded instruction setting, which focuses on instruction modality, this scenario enables more nuanced analysis of modality-specific reasoning gaps, revealing whether VLMs process and calibrate equivalent information differently depending on its format."

            "content": "We evaluate broad selection of state-of-the-art VLMs, spanning both commercial and open-source models. To better understand how training objectives and reasoning styles affect verbalized calibration, we categorize the models into three groups based on their alignment strategies and dominant reasoning modalities: 1. General Instruction-Tuned Models: These models are optimized for following human instructions across wide range of multimodal tasks. They are typically trained with supervised fine-tuning and enhanced with preference alignment. Representative models in this category include OpenAI GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024a), Qwen-VL series (Qwen-VL-2/2.5 in both 7B and 72B scales) (Bai et al., 2025), InternVL3-78B (Zhu et al., 2025), and Kimi-VL-A3B-Instruct (Kimi Team et al., 2025). 2. Text-Centric Reasoning Models: This group includes models that primarily reason over textual representations, often enhanced via reinforcement learning or instruction tuning with an emphasis on chain-of-thought or selfreflective reasoning. These models typically generate intermediate reasoning steps in text before producing answers. Included here are OpenAI o1 (OpenAI et al., 2024b), KimiVL-A3B-Thinking (Kimi Team et al., 2025), Skywork-R1V-38B (Peng et al., 2025), and Skywork-R1V2-38B (Chris et al., 2025). 3. Vision-Centric Reasoning Models: These models are explicitly designed to perform visual chain-of-thought reasoning, where multimodal inputs, particularly images, are not only used for grounding but also as part of the models internal reasoning process. OpenAI o3 and o4-mini (OpenAI, 2025) fall into this category, as they are trained to natively integrate visual elements into multi-step reasoning workflows. This categorization allows us to analyze how verbalized calibration varies depending on whether reasoning is primarily text-driven, vision-driven, or instruction-oriented, offering clearer lens into the strengths and limitations of different model families."

Calibration evaluates whether the models predicted confidence reflects its true likelihood of being correct. For example, when model assigns 90% confidence to its answers, it should be accurate approximately 90% of the time. This alignment is especially important for applications that rely on reliable uncertainty estimates, such as safety-critical systems or humanAI collaboration. To assess calibration, we use the Expected Calibration Error (ECE), which captures the average difference between predicted confidence and observed accuracy across bins: (cid:88) ECE = m= Bm acc(Bm) avgConf(Bm) (1) Here, is the total number of examples and Bm denotes the set of samples in the m-th confidence bin. We use = 10 bins in all cases and compute ECE only over attempted questions when evaluating on factuality datasets."

Specifically, o3 and o4-mini, which are optimized for visual reasoning, produce lower ECE scores across benchmarks, reflecting more reliable confidence estimates. In contrast, instruction-following and text-based reasoning models tend to exhibit higher ECE values, indicating less accurate self-assessment. This difference is especially notable in the two mathematical benchmarks, where all VLMs achieve similar levels of accuracy, yet visual reasoning models are significantly better calibrated. Additionally, when comparing instruction-tuned models with similarly scaled text reasoning models (e.g., GPT-4.1 vs. o1, Kimi-VL-Instruct vs. Kimi-VL-Thinking), we observe that reasoningoriented models tend to show slightly improved calibration. This suggests that reinforcement learning and reasoning-focused training can enhance models ability to assess its own uncertainty, particularly within the same modality, though modest benefits may also emerge from enhancements within the text modality. Taken together, these findings highlight the complementary roles of modalityspecific and reasoning-specific training in building VLMs with more trustworthy and well-calibrated verbalized confidence."

            "content": "In our final evaluation setting, we assess calibration performance when VLMs are given identical textual instructions paired with semantically equivalent inputs presented in either the textual or visual modality for reasoning. The corresponding ECE results are reported in Table 2. Consistent with our previous findings, we observe substantial calibration gap between modalities in most models. Although the underlying content remains identical, VLMs tend to produce less calibrated responses when reasoning over visual inputs compared to text. This discrepancy is especially evident in the mathematics domain, where text-based inputs are relatively easy for VLMs to solve, but performance degrades noticeably with visual input. In these cases, models often assign high confidence regardless of their actual visual reasoning capabilities, leading to significantly higher ECE scores. The only notable exceptions are visual reasoning models, which consistently exhibit smaller calibration gaps across modalities when compared to instruction-tuned and text-centric reasoning models. We also found particularly difficult task, puzzle in the game category, although state-of-the-art models all show accuracy lower than 10%, only o3 shows moderate level calibration, suggesting the great potential of vision-based reasoning in reducing miscalibration. Taken together, our experiments across the three Figure 3: Model performance comparison across and calibration. The upper right indicates better overall performance. with visual reasoning models achieving the most reliable confidence estimates. These results further support our earlier observation that both modalityspecific and reasoning-specific training play critical role in improving verbalized uncertainty in VLMs. When comparing performance under visual instructions to the general evaluation setting, we observe clear drop in both accuracy and calibration. Even the strongest models, such as o3 and o4-mini, exhibit noticeable degradation when instructions are presented visually rather than textually. These findings point to persistent misalignment between vision and language modalities in current VLMs, indicating that interpreting visual instructions remains core challenge in multimodal understanding. Addressing this modality gap is crucial for developing more robust and trustworthy VLMs ca6 evaluation settings provide comprehensive picture of how current VLMs handle verbalized uncertainty under varying input structures. In the general setting, most models show moderate calibration, though miscalibration remains widespread. In the embedded instruction setting, calibration performance declines noticeably, highlighting challenges in processing and interpreting instructions presented purely through vision. Finally, in the semantically aligned setting, we observe clear modality gap: despite receiving isomorphic representations, most models exhibit poorer calibration when reasoning with visual inputs compared to text. This gap persists even among strong models, with the exception of those explicitly trained for visual reasoning. These findings collectively suggest that while verbalized uncertainty is promising for interpretable confidence estimation, its reliability in VLMs is highly sensitive to both modality and model design, underscoring the need for modalityaware training and evaluation strategies. Comprehensive results for additional models and various prompts on the employed benchmark are provided in Appendix and D."

            "content": "PROMPTING (VCAP) As shown in our evaluation results, miscalibration is persistent issue across modalities in many VLMs, particularly among instruction-tuned models. To address this, we introduce prompting strategy, Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting (VCAP), that leverages the multi-turn dialogue capabilities of instruction models to enhance calibration. Motivated by the observed modality gaps, we ask whether confidence signals derived from the vision modality can be explicitly incorporated into the final response generation. This leads us to design two-stage prompting approach that encourages the model to separately reflect on visual confidence before producing calibrated answer, as shown in Figure 4. VCAP separates visual understanding from task execution to improve calibration accuracy. In the first round, the VLM is asked to describe the visual input in detail and provide confidence score, focusing exclusively on the visual modality to minIn imize cognitive load and isolate perception. the second round, the model is prompted to complete the task and generate verbalized confidence score, this time taking into account its prior selfFigure 4: The illustration of our Visual ConfidenceAware Prompting (VCAP). assessment from the visual description.

In the general evaluation setting, we adopt CoT prompting to elicit both reasoning steps and confidence estimates within single turn, which we adopt as baseline here. As for stronger baseline, we compare against Top-K prompting, where the model generates multiple candidate answers with associated confidence scores, and the one with the highest confidence is selected as the final output (Tian et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024). Additionally, we report results using self-reflection prompting (Xiong et al., 2024; Vashurin et al., 2024), another two-round strategy in which the model first generates an answer, followed by second prompt that elicits confidence estimate for that response.

Across both model sizes of Qwen2.5-VL, our two-stage prompting method leads to moderate improvement in accuracy and more notable gain in calibration performance, even when compared to the Top-K and self-reflection baselines.

            "content": "In this paper, we first evaluate whether VLMs can express their uncertainties in calibrated manner. Across various types of models and datasets, our results highlight the widespread miscalibration issue in current VLMs and suggest that vision-based reasoning can significantly improve both multimodal reasoning and reduce the modality gap. Building on this insight, we propose VISUAL CONFIDENCEAWARE PROMPTING, two-stage prompting strategy that explicitly guides VLMs to express more calibrated confidence by decoupling visual interpretation from task execution. Previous research on verbalized uncertainty has typically focused on isolated aspects of instruct VLMs behaviors. Groot and Valdenegro Toro (2024) evaluated verbalized uncertainty using small 39-image Japanese-language dataset. Borszukovszki et al. (2025) examined how VLMs respond to input noise, while Zhao et al. (2025) investigated object-level miscalibration and proposed two-stage fine-tuning approach for calibration. Our work expands upon these efforts by conducting broader evaluation across multiple domains, prompting strategies, and modality configurations, showing that miscalibration is consistent challenge in VLMs. In parallel, the emergence of text reasoning models has reshaped the landscape of LLM development. Zeng et al. (2025) systematically evaluated verbalized uncertainty in reasoning models and found that they tend to produce more calibrated outputs than instruction-tuned models. Our study provides complementary evidence from multimodal perspective, showing that modality-specific reasoning in VLMs, particularly reasoning grounded in visual input, contributes to improved calibration and confidence reliability. Previous works have introduced variety of finetuning and prompting strategies to improve verbalized uncertainty in LLMs. These include methods such as distilling self-consistency signals into the model (Hager et al., 2025) and using Top-K prompting to elicit more calibrated confidence scores (Tian et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024). In this work, we extend these efforts to the multimodal domain by evaluating and improving verbalized calibration in VLMs. We propose two-stage prompting strategy that first isolates visual understanding and then guides task execution based on self-assessed visual confidence. Our results show that this approach can effectively enhance calibration in VLMs across modalities. These findings underscore the importance of explicitly leveraging multimodal inputs and modality-specific reasoning when designing strategies for improving confidence estimation in VLMs. This line of work highlights the need for calibration-aware prompting designs that are sensitive to the structure and strengths of different input modalities."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "In this work, we comprehensively evaluated how VLMs express uncertainty through natural language and proposed visual confidence-aware prompting to address the identified challenges. One key limitation is that although \"think with images\" models like o3 and o4-mini demonstrate exceptional verbalized calibration, their closed-source nature and lack of publicly available implementation details make it difficult to understand and analyze why they significantly outperform text reasoning and instruction-tuned models. Furthermore, since there are currently only two closed-source OpenAI models with production-level performance in the \"think with images\" category, we cannot investigate how different model families perform in terms of verbalized calibration within this approach. Additionally, while our goal was to evaluate verbalized calibration across broad spectrum of tasks, we did not conduct dedicated experiments to investigate some of the challenging scenarios frequently encountered in downstream applications, such as temporal visual grounding in video understanding. We also consider these directions to be meaningful avenues for future work."
