            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed fundamental shift in the landscape of artificial intelligence, moving from the generation of coherent text to the creation of autonomous agents capable of complex, goal-oriented behavior [1, 2, 24, 26, 29, 40]. This transition from passive text generators to active problem-solvers necessitates corresponding evolution in evaluation methodologies. While foundational benchmarks like MMLU [10] and SuperGLUE [31] are instrumental in assessing the static knowledge of LLMs, they are insufficient for measuring what model can do when deployed as part of an interactive, goal-seeking system. An agents performance is defined not just by its underlying model, but by its ability to plan, use external tools, and adapt to dynamic environment. In response, new generation of agent-centric benchmarks has emerged, primarily focused on evaluating search, tool usage, and coding skills in controlled or simulated settings. For example, AgentBench [17] provides comprehensive evaluation of an agents reasoning and decision-making across eight simulated environments, such as operating systems and databases. Similarly, WebArena [47] and mind2web [6] offer high-fidelity simulations of real-world websites, assessing an agents ability to complete complex, long-horizon tasks. GAIA [18], introduced to evaluate agents as general-purpose assistants, presents real-world questions that are conceptually simple for humans but require sophisticated blend of reasoning, multi-modality, web browsing, and tool proficiency. Its questions are designed to have clear, factual answers, simplifying evaluation while testing broad range of skills across three difficulty levels. BrowseComp [33] challenges agents to locate hard-to-find, entangled information online using inverted questions that are difficult to solve but easy to verify. This benchmark specifically tests persistence and creative search strategies, going beyond simple fact retrieval. In the specialized domain of software engineering, SWE-bench [13] evaluates agents on their ability to resolve real-world issues from open-source GitHub repositories. By having agents generate code patch and verify it against the projects test suite, it provides realistic, execution-based assessment of coding proficiency. While these benchmarks offer valuable insights into agent capabilities, they largely address static, well-defined problems whose solutions are already known. Further, they fail to address critical gap: the ability to synthesize dynamic, real-world information, process it, and perform complex analysis and reasoningthe very skills possessed by human experts across different domains. Future prediction, in fact, directly addresses these two drawbacks. This task directly tests an agents ability to integrate dynamic, real-world information, process it in context, and generate complex analysis and reasoning about problems whose answers are not yet known to the world. Such tasks naturally involve dynamic element, and their primary significance lies in preparing agents to anticipate and navigate genuinely novel scenarios, mirroring the foresight applied by human experts across diverse domains. However, building benchmarks on future prediction faces significant methodological and technical challenges. First, creating questions and answers for such benchmark is inherently difficult because forecasting requires information that is not readily available or easily constructed. Unlike static factual questions, future events are uncertain, making it difficult to generate reliable, verifiable answers. Additionally, the dynamic nature of real-world data means that the benchmark would require continuous updates to ensure relevance and accuracysomething that would demand constantly evolving question pool [15]. This continuous update process is both technically demanding and resource-intensive. Another significant challenge is the timeliness of testing, as it cannot be performed after the resolution date, and there are inherent flaws when relying on historical data for evaluation [22]. Past data inherently contains information about future events, which leads to logical leakagewhere knowledge of the outcome can influence the evaluation, undermining its accuracy. Additionally, relying on historical data to assess future prediction introduces retrieval contamination: search results for past events are inevitably biased by knowledge of events that happened afterward, making it impossible to accurately evaluate an agents forecasting ability. Therefore, probably the only methodologically sound way to evaluate future prediction capability is to do so prospectively, in live, forward-looking pipeline. In response to this need, we introduce FutureX, dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is built upon semi-automated pipeline that continuously collects future-oriented questions from 195 diverse websites, curated from pool of 2,008 sites covering areas such as politics, economics, technology, sports, healthcare, and more. This curation process involves both LLM-based agents and human experts, necessary combination to ensure quality. Each event is associated with start date (several days prior to the resolution date) and resolution date. The pipeline automatically collects and stores agents predictions on the start date. After the resolution date passes, the system dynamically crawls the web to retrieve the ground-truth outcome and scores the agents prior predictions. FutureX provides four key advantages that directly address the limitations of existing benchmarks: Large-Scale and Broad Domain Coverage: Using semi-automated pipeline for question collection and filtering, we currently select 195 websites from pool of 2,008 as our sources. These selected websites cover wide range of topicsincluding politics, economics, finance, sports, and entertainmentmaking it, to our knowledge, the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction. Real-Time Updates: FutureX continuously collects future-oriented questions from 128 websites, with daily updates to ensure real-time relevance. By dynamically crawling answers, the benchmark maintains both timeliness and diversity in the questions, presenting unique challenge for LLM agents to process and adapt to constantly evolving information. No Data Contamination: By focusing exclusively on future events, FutureX inherently eliminates any risk of data contamination, preventing any exploitation of historical information to manipulate the results. Comprehensive & Automated Assessment of LLM Agents: Building on FutureX, we have developed fully automated evaluation pipeline that updates future questions daily, runs various LLM agents for each event on its start date, collects event outcomes after the resolution date, and evaluates agents performance. The models under evaluation include base LLMs, LLMs with reasoning and search capabilities, open-source Deep Research Agents, and closed-source Deep Research Agents, for total of 25 models. In addition to the overall performance leaderboard in Figure 1, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM agents performance, addressing the following questions: How do LLM agents perform on questions of varying difficulty levels and across different domains? (performance analysis, see Section 4.2 and Section 4.3) What factors (such as the type of LLM model, agent framework, and question domain) have the most statistically significant impact on performance? (performance analysis, see Section 4.4) How do LLM agents perform when making predictions after the resolution date? (performance analysis, see Section 4.5.1) How planning and search capabilities affect the performance? (performance analysis, see Section 4.5.2 and Section 4.5.3) Furthermore, we also provide some out-of-benchmark analysis that emerged during the development of FutureX, including: Can LLM agents beat professional Wall Street financial analysts in finance prediction? (capability analysis, see Section 5.1) Are Deep Research agents vulnerable to fake news? (safety analysis, see Section 5.2) Can the most advanced LLMs with reasoning and web-searching capabilities gather timely information effectively? (efficiency analysis, see Section 5.3) To pave the way of the Second Half of AI1, we firmly believe FutureX has great potential to unlock new research directions for developing LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in real-world, high-stakes domains. 1https://ysymyth.github.io/The-Second-Half/"

            "content": "This section begins with review of the relevant literature on LLM agent benchmarks, encompassing both established and recent live evaluations, as well as benchmarks for future prediction. Following this, we offer concise overview of advanced deep research agents, explaining why they fit the future prediction task well. Agent Benchmark new wave of benchmarks is designed specifically to evaluate LLM-based agents on complex, interactive tasks rather than isolated questions. For example, AgentBench [17] introduces 8 distinct simulated environments (from operating systems and databases to web interfaces and games) to assess an agents planning, tool use, and decision-making abilities. WebArena [47] provides high-fidelity simulations of real websites (e-commerce, forums, collaborative coding, content management) to test long-horizon web interaction tasks, where Agents must execute multi-step web browsing actions to accomplish user goals. Another benchmark, GAIA [18], focuses on general-purpose assistant capabilities with 466 real-world questions that require reasoning, multi-modality, web search, and tool use. These questions are conceptually simple for humans (humans score 92%) but very challenging for current models, highlighting large gap in robust understanding. In the realm of information retrieval, BrowseComp [32] consists of 1,266 inverted questions designed to entangle information and thwart simple lookup. Agents must perform creative, multi-hop web searches to uncover hidden facts, testing their persistence and strategic search skills beyond basic fact retrieval. In software engineering, SWE-bench [13] evaluates agents on resolving real GitHub issues by generating code patches and verifying them against project test suites, and based on this, multiple variants are proposed, such as SWE-bench-Verified [20], SWE-gym [23], Multi-SWE-bench [43], and SWE-smith [39]. Collectively, these benchmarks offer valuable insights into various aspects of agent performancefrom web navigation and tool use to codingbut they primarily operate in controlled environments with predefined task scopes and information. Additionally, these benchmarks do not integrate complex reasoning and information-gathering capabilities, both of which are essential for our proposed FutureX. Live Benchmark Besides traditional benchmarks with static question sets, live benchmarks have recently emerged, such as LiveBench [34], LiveCodeBench [12] and SWE-bench-live [44], which automatically update questions to enable more reliable, contamination-free evaluations. Besides, Li et al. [16] introduce Arena-Hard that is frequently updated from live data in Chatbot Arena [3] to avoid potential over-fitting or test set leakage. Our proposed FutureX follows this trend, offering fully automated, live benchmark for future predictionwhere even the events themselves are live. Compared to the benchmarks discussed, ours is more aligned with real-world professional analysis scenarios across multiple domains, making it highly practical. Furthermore, the tasks are inherently more challenging to design, and the events are significantly harder to manipulate and collect, which makes our benchmark substantially more difficult to implement than previous. Future Prediction significant gap in current LLM agent evaluations is their ability to handle dynamic, real-world information and reason about future eventscore skills human professional analysts routinely apply across finance, business, politics, and technology trend analysis. Future prediction serves as critical test for these capabilities, demanding agents to gather up-to-date evidence and anticipate outcomes in an open-ended environment. However, building reliable benchmark for forecasting presents unique challenges: unlike static question-answering, future events are inherently uncertain and cannot be easily verified in advance. Crafting and continuously updating questions and answers about the future is therefore challenging, as the correct outcome only becomes known with time [15]. Previous efforts to evaluate LLMs on forecasting, such as backtesting with historical data [35], risk introducing temporal leakage and retrieval contamination due to retrospective information influencing internet searches on past events [22]. Furthermore, many existing benchmarks [8, 15, 19] focus on evaluating LLMs without search capabilities, which is impractical for real-world future prediction. Benchmarks like those proposed in Guan et al. [8] and Nako and Jatowt [19] are also one-time collected and lack the live updates necessary for dynamic events. While ForecastBench [15] attempts to address the future event challenge by using only questions about future outcomes, it predominantly evaluates vanilla LLMs, and relies on prediction market events, dominated by multiple-choice questions. This limits both the diversity of events included and, critically, the assessment of an agents ability to perform open-ended, real-world information gathering. Similarly, FutureBench [30] is restricted to events from PolyMarket and includes very small number of 4 events (30). This limited diversity in current future prediction benchmarks highlights the inherent difficulty in collecting and evaluating such events, particularly those with unknown answers or those that have not yet transpired. Although challenging, we adopt this direction because it ensures the absence of information contamination and directly evaluates how effectively an LLM-agent can synthesize real-time data, reason under uncertainty, and predict future eventscapabilities that represent the next frontier for expert-level AI agents, which is exactly what our proposed FutureX seeks to achieve. Deep Research Agent Deep research agents [7, 21, 25, 36, 45, 46] are designed for tackling complex, multiturn informational research tasks that require dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon planning, multi-hop information retrieval, and iterative tool use. These agents offer superior capabilities compared to previous models [11]. Their intrinsic ability to gather, synthesize, and reason about dynamic, real-world information makes them particularly well-suited for tasks involving future predictions, trend identification, and outcome modeling. In FutureX, we assess both typical open-source deep research frameworks and state-of-the-art closed-source models, showcasing the most advanced performances of LLM agents. Additionally, FutureX serves as challenging benchmark, pushing deep research agents to demonstrate their competitive edge."

            "title": "3.1 Design Principles of FutureX",
            "content": "To clearly articulate the design philosophy of FutureX and draw sharp contrast with other benchmarks, we demonstrate four core design dimensions. For each dimension, we first explain its critical importance in evaluating LLM Agents and then detail the unique advantages that FutureX offers. Eliminating Data Contamination. fundamental challenge in LLM evaluation is data contamination. Traditional static benchmarks, such as MMLU, consist of fixed datasets. As models are trained on ever-expanding web-scale corpora, it is highly probable that these test questions and answers have already been seen by the model during its training phase [5]. This compromises the validity of the evaluation, turning it into test of memorization rather than true measure of the models reasoning and generalization capabilities [37]. Similar concerns also hold for agent benchmarks like GAIA [18] and SWE-bench [13], where the use of fixed questions makes it difficult to avoid the intentional inclusion of questions that agents may have already memorized, rather than truly generalizing. Therefore, designing benchmarks that can fundamentally eliminate data contamination and ensure the timeliness and fairness of the evaluation is critical standard of quality. Advantage of FutureX: The design philosophy of FutureX inherently solves the data contamination problem. By defining its core task as future prediction, FutureX guarantees that the ground-truth answers to all questions have not yet occurred at the time of the agents prediction, making it impossible for them to exist in any models training data. Moreover, the events themselves are inherently unpredictable during agent development, which further prevents agents from memorizing answers during training. Additionally, FutureX maintains daily updates to event construction and manipulation, ensuring that events evolve continuously, thereby enhancing its dynamic nature. This is strategy of being contamination-impossible by design, which creates an absolutely fair evaluation environment. It compels agents to rely on their capabilities for information gathering, dynamic analysis, and reasoning, rather than on memorization. This forward-looking, live evaluation pipeline completely avoids the logical leakage and retrieval contamination issues associated with back-testing on historical data, ensuring the purity and credibility of the evaluation results [22]. Simulating Real-World Challenges and Evaluating Core Intelligence. The evolution of AI is shifting from evaluating models static knowledge base to assessing its agencyits ability to solve problems in dynamic, complex, real-world environments [42]. superior agent needs to know not just what, but how. 5 Consequently, the trend in modern benchmark design is to create scenarios that simulate real-world challenges, testing an agents integrated abilities in planning, tool use, and environmental adaptation [17, 38, 41]. Future prediction serves as the ultimate touchstone for this higher-level intelligence, as it requires an agent to perform high-quality analysis and decision-making under conditions of incomplete information and uncertainty, just as human experts do in many domains. Advantage of FutureX: The task design of FutureX directly targets the most central and valuable form of intelligence for an LLM agent: complex analysis and forward-thinking. It does not operate in simulated environment (like WebArena or AgentBench). Instead, it places the agent directly into the real worlds information flow, tasking it with making predictions about tangible, upcoming events with real-world significance (e.g., economic fluctuations, technological breakthroughs, political elections). This task is inherently holistic, demanding suite of advanced cognitive skills, including information gathering, data synthesis, probability weighing, and causal reasoning. This makes the evaluation score from FutureX more than just number; it is direct measure of whether an agent can perform at the level of professional human analyst. Large-Scale and Cross-Domain Comprehensive Coverage. An LLM agents capabilities must be validated across diverse range of scenarios to prove its ability to generalize. Benchmarks that are too narrow for instance, limited to specific websites or task typescan lead to model overfitting or fail to provide comprehensive picture of its performance across different domains. high-quality benchmark must therefore feature large-scale and broad domain coverage to deliver more reliable and holistic evaluation. Advantage of FutureX: FutureX is currently the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction. Through semi-automated data pipeline, we curate and filter information from 195 highquality sources, selected from pool of over 2,000 websites. These sources cover wide array of domains, including politics, economics, finance, technology, sports, and entertainment. This scale and diversity ensure that FutureX can conduct comprehensive and unbiased stress test on agents, rigorously examining their adaptability and robustness in varied information ecosystems and knowledge domains. This continuous, large-scale data processing capability is something that static or small-scale benchmarks cannot easily replicate. Dynamic and Automated Evaluation Process. For benchmark that aims to evaluate an agents ability to process dynamic information, the benchmark itself must be live. Static or manually updated evaluation processes are inefficient and unable to keep up with the rapid changes in the real world. Establishing fully automated system that can continuously update questions, collect answers, and perform objective scoring is essential for large-scale, real-time evaluation and is key sign of the benchmarks technical maturity. Advantage of FutureX: One of the core values of FutureX lies in its highly automated, dynamic, and closed-loop evaluation process. As shown in Figure 2, our system automatically collects new futureevent questions from information sources on daily basis. On each events designated start date, it automatically runs the various agent models and stores their predictions. Once the events resolution date has passed, the system again automatically crawls the web to obtain the ground-truth outcome and scores the agents prior predictions. This entire process operates without manual intervention, ensuring the evaluations timeliness, objectivity, and scalability. This design not only overcomes the technical challenges of maintaining live benchmark but also makes the long-term, continuous evaluation of as many as 25 models feasiblea level of technical complexity and implementation difficulty that far exceeds traditional static evaluation frameworks. Overview of FutureX. Following our design principles, FutureX is live-updating benchmark for future prediction that covers broad range of source websites and domains. With daily and weekly updates, it features an automated pipeline for event collection, curation, and agent evaluationall running smoothly and reliably. As shown in Table 1, FutureX demonstrates clear advantages over previous benchmarks from both data and evaluation perspectives, supporting much broader range of events and more diverse set of LLM agents for evaluation. Specifically, recent live benchmarks [15, 30] primarily rely on prediction market websites for live updates. However, as demonstrated in Section 3.3, these events tend to be relatively simple, and many involve subjective questions that are not well-suited for rigorous evaluation. In sharp contrast, FutureX 6 Table 1 Comparison with Previous Benchmarks for Future Prediction.Note that in the Live Update column indicates that benchmark supports this feature, though it may not be updated regularly. Similarly, in the LLM Agents column for FutureBench reflects evaluation of only single open-source agent.

In comparison, FutureBench [30] evaluates only single open-source agent with few LLMs. In the following, we will first provide detailed overview of the benchmark construction, followed by the key characteristics of data in FutureX, and the evaluation protocol of FutureX."

            "title": "3.2.1 Event Database Construction",
            "content": "This phase consists of website collection and website curation. During website collection, we begin by using the AIME agent [28] to gather large number of website URLs relevant to domains such as politics, economics, finance, technology, and sports, with total of 2,008 websites. Then for website curation, these URLs are then subjected to an initial LLM-based check, utilizing combination of Seed1.5-Thinking [27] and DeepSeek-R1 [9]. This process performs tasks such as deduplication, assessing the suitability of the websites for question generation, and evaluating their update frequency, reducing the number of websites to 636. The remaining URLs are then manually reviewed, focusing on identifying reliable sourcesparticularly ranking lists and websites with high update frequencyensuring that only the most relevant and up-to-date information is included. After this manual review, our initial version has 195 high-quality websites as our current event database, including five types: 7 Prediction market websites: Websites that allow users to bet on or predict the outcomes of future events, including political events, sports outcomes, or financial market movements. Examples include gjopen, Polymarket, etc. News websites: Websites that provide up-to-date news, analysis, and market-moving events, such as earnings reports, economic policy changes, sports news, technology trends, and geopolitical developments. Examples include Reuters, ESPN, etc. Entertainment ranking websites: Websites that provide rankings related to music, movies, TV shows, and other entertainment forms. These rankings are often based on user reviews, sales data, critical acclaim, or popularity metrics. Examples include Billboard, IMDb, etc. Government websites: Official websites that provide economic data, regulations, and reports from government agencies. These include statistical data like GDP, unemployment rates, inflation, fiscal policies, and other public economic indicators. Examples include U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, China Agricultural and Rural Information Site, etc. Real-time data platforms: Platforms that provide real-time or near-real-time data on various financial markets. These platforms are used to monitor live stock prices, forex rates, cryptocurrency values, and other asset prices, offering instant updates to help with timely trading decisions. Examples include Shenzhen Stock Exchange Site, Sina Finance, etc. Moreover, we are actively exploring more types, including corporate websites that release companys activities & financial reports, e-commerce websites, and research and educational platforms. In addition, as shown in Figure 2, this event database is updated daily to remove events with unavailable outcomes and continuously add new events using current high-quality websites as seeds. This update, along with event curation (to be introduced in Section 3.2.2), preserves the dynamic nature of FutureX and prevents potential cheating by explicitly designing similar questions to train the agent, ensuring that the agents true generalization ability is accurately reflected. Figure 3 The detailed future event daily curation process, which manipulates daily and weekly events from the event database. As an example, the number of events between July 24th and July 31st remaining after each step is shown in red. Note that the number of events each week varies due to fluctuations in prediction market events (the first row in the figure)."

            "title": "3.2.2 Future Event Daily Curation",
            "content": "Based on the event templates, we perform daily future event curation to generate prediction questions for each day. As shown in Figure 3, this process consists of two main steps: event manipulation and event filtering. Event Manipulation This phase involves transforming each website into concrete future event format suitable for our pipeline, which varies depending on the type of website. Prediction market websites There are already feature future prediction events on prediction market websites. Therefore, we crawl these events on daily basis, which are typically binary or multiple-choice. For each event, we employ the Seed1.5-Thinking model [27] to introduce set of unrelated (random) choices, thereby 8 increasing the complexity and challenging the systems search and reasoning capabilities at higher level. For instance, if LLM agents were to query each choice individually, it would significantly reduce efficiency. Other types of websites For other websites where future events cannot be directly obtained, we follow these steps to make more challenging open-ended questions: Template Generation: We create an event template for each site, which can take variables (for example, target, date, etc.) as inputs to make the events adaptable over time, even for the same website. The process is as follows: First, we use an LLM to design candidate question templates based on the content of each webpage. Next, we specify the input variables for answer scraping. After the answer is scraped, the LLM checks whether the answer can be successfully retrieved. To ensure reliability, human reviewer then verifies the results and selects the most appropriate question templates. Once an event template is established, it remains fixed within our pipeline, eliminating the need for recreation in subsequent iterations. Below are two examples. Website 1: https://www.dongchedi.com/ (Chinas largest car review website) Variables: rank, date, target Event Template: Which car will be ranked {rank} on the {target} board on {date} at Dongchedi? Website 2: https://www.google.com/finance/ Variables: stock, date Event Template: What will be the highest point of {stock} on {date}? Randomization: Based on the event templates, in order to prevent asking the same future event every day, we apply randomization to our templates by varying the input variables within the same event template (and for the same website). For example, for ranking websites, we may ask the LLM agents to predict different ranks each day or predict ranks within different sub-ranking lists. For government websites, we may request different statistics or metrics. For real-time data platforms, we may focus on different markets, indexes, or stocks. Below are some examples.

After manipulating the events, we are able to generate 500 daily and weekly future events as candidates out of 195 high-quality websites. Note that each future event is associated with an answer resolution date that will be used in the Answer Daily Acquisition phase (see Section 3.2.4). Event Filtering For events crawled from the internet (for example, prediction market websites like Polymarket and gjopen), we carefully filter the event set before testing the LLM agents to ensure the validity of the events, where we mainly filter out easy or trivial events, harmful events, and subjective events. Harmful events: These events include content that may involve discrimination, hate speech, or other harmful factors. Such events can introduce bias or propagate misleading information, undermining the integrity of the predictions. To mitigate this, we use combination of Seed1.5-Thinking [27], DeepSeek-R1 [9], and Gemini-2.5-flash [4] to filter out harmful events from the set before testing to ensure that only appropriate and reliable data is used. Subjective events: Events that rely on individual opinions or subjective judgment are difficult to predict reliably. These events introduce significant variability in responses, which can disrupt the testing process. To address this, we use LLM-as-a-judge to filter out such events with combination of Seed1.5Thinking [27], DeepSeek-R1 [9], and Gemini-2.5-flash [4] to ensure reliability. As shown in Figure 3, between July 15th and July 22nd, we drop 294 unsuitable events (both harmful and subjective events). Examples include: Will we win 100k tomorrow at the mara hackathon? and finish Parks Our Nations Path by EOM July?. Yes-or-No events: Events with binary choices (such as yes or no, or the outcome of single match) are relatively easy to predict, with even random guessing achieving an accuracy of 50%. Since we cannot introduce additional choices for these events, we significantly downsample these yes/no binary events. As shown in Figure 3, events collected from prediction market websites are reduced from 193 to 36 for one week. Through event filtering, we significantly reduce the number of events from prediction market websites to make our benchmark more challenging. This ensures the high quality of FutureX and stands in sharp contrast to previous benchmarks [15, 30], where prediction market events dominate. Additionally, to maintain event diversity and prevent homogeneity across other types of websites, we randomly select only one question per template per website for inclusion in the daily prediction set, resulting in 61 daily events and 71 weekly events (61x7+71=498 open-ended events every week)."

            "content": "The primary challenge of this phase is the need to complete testing every day, as the events change daily. Some events may have already yielded results, making the testing process highly time-sensitive. This stands in stark contrast to static benchmark tasks, where the questions remain fixed and can be tested at any time. We begin by introducing the models under evaluation, followed by an overview of our automated testing pipeline. Models under Evaluation Future prediction tasks require models capable of both reasoning and searching to gather relevant information and make complex predictions, and we test models representing different levels of capability. Base LLMs form the foundation, providing insights into the fundamental predictive abilities derived from their inherent knowledge. LLMs with search and reasoning capabilities enhance these basic functions by autonomously gathering and processing external information, offering more advanced level of performance. Recent deep research agents integrate these features with sophisticated multi-agent systems or workflows, demonstrating even more advanced reasoning and data exploration, and are designed to surpass the expertise of professional human analysts. As result, we evaluate 25 models across 4 categories: Base LLM These models serve as the baseline for evaluating the core predictive capabilities of large language models in future prediction tasks. Testing them helps us understand how their inherent knowledge contributes to making accurate predictions. We evaluate 8 advanced LLMs (including both standard and reasoning, open-source and closed-source models), such as DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini-2.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, Qwen3-235B, Qwen3-32B and DouBao-Seed1.6-Thinking2. Agentic LLM with Thinking and Searching These models are augmented with reasoning and search capabilities, allowing them to retrieve information from the internet and handle more complex queries. This enables them to demonstrate the advanced capabilities of agentic LLMs that leverage tools for enhanced performance. We evaluate 7 advanced closed-source models, including GPT-o4-mini (Think&Search), GPT-4o (Think&Search), Hunyuan (Think&Search), DeepSeek (Think&Search), Qwen3-235b (Think&Search), Grok4 (Think&Search), and Doubao (Think&Search), representing broad range of leading companies. Open-source Deep Research Agents Several open-source deep research agents have been introduced, designed to conduct comprehensive information gathering and reasoning through hierarchical agent systems. These models enable more sophisticated and autonomous data exploration by leveraging 2We tested GPT-o1, GPT-o3, and GPT-o4-mini, but we found that they frequently refused to make predictions. Therefore we have not included them here. 10 multi-agent architectures to process complex queries and integrate insights from diverse sources. Given their ability to autonomously gather and reason over large datasets, we believe these frameworks are particularly well-suited for future prediction tasks. Therefore, we include two representative frameworks SmolAgent [25] from Huggingface and AgentOrchestra [45] from Skywork AIand evaluate them within our pipeline. For each agent, we integrate different LLM models, resulting in total of 8 models (agent framework base LLM model) for evaluation. Closed-source Deep Research Agents These proprietary models are tested to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art research tools with specialized capabilities. Their inclusion in the testing process helps benchmark high-performance, commercial models that could set the standard for future prediction tasks in this domain. We evaluate Gemini Deep Research [7] and Doubao Deep Research3. Automated Testing Pipeline FutureX operates as live benchmark with daily updates, setting it apart from traditional benchmarks that rely on fixed question sets. As result, all models must be tested each dayany delay means missing the opportunity to predict that days events. These missed events may either resolve the next day, making evaluation meaningless, or introduce unfair comparisons, as the information available on the internet evolves daily. Therefore, an automated and efficient testing pipeline is essential to the success of FutureX. To achieve this, we: Implement high-performance, multi-process testing framework. For fair comparison, all models are triggered on daily schedule, with strict error handling to prevent failures from blocking the pipeline. Each model is given maximum of 30 minutes per question to ensure timely execution. Apply event filtering (see Section 3.2.2), selecting 70100 high-quality and diverse events each day for evaluation."

            "content": "Answer acquisition is critical phase in FutureX. While we can pose questions about wide range of future events, the success of evaluation ultimately depends on whether we can reliably obtain the corresponding answers. Furthermore, given the pressure of agent daily prediction in Section 3.2.3, high answer acquisition success rate means more efficient evaluation. To this end, much of our effort in constructing the event database (see Section 3.2.1) focuses on ensuring answer availability. We carefully select high-quality websites that consistently provide verifiable outcomes on daily or weekly basis. Building on this, our pipeline automatically retrieves answers each day by following the procedures outlined below. Date Filtering We begin by filtering events to identify those whose resolution date aligns with the current day. To account for potential delays in answer availability from some websites, we also include unresolved events from previous days in the daily answer acquisition set. Moreover, since FutureX includes events from around the world, we standardize all timestamps to Beijing time (UTC+8) to ensure consistent scheduling and resolution tracking. Website Crawling With the daily answer acquisition set, we then crawl the corresponding website and extract the core content. Since different websites update at varying timesand single crawl may not always succeedwe perform scheduled crawls at 14:00, 16:00, 18:00, and 20:00 each day to maximize the chances of successfully capturing the target content. Answer Extraction Based on the core content retrieved from each website, we use the Seed1.5-Thinking model [27] to extract the precise answer. To improve accuracyespecially when multiple results for different dates are presentwe provide the model with additional inputs, including the original question and the resolution date. In addition, as expected during the initial stages, various types of failure cases arise. To systematically address them, we categorize failures into two types: crawling errors and extraction errors. For crawling errorssuch as those caused by anti-bot measureswe update our event database to exclude websites that are no longer 3Due to policy and API stability issues, we are unable to test the GPT Deep Research and Claude models. 11 Figure 4 Domains of all events included in FutureX, from July 20th to August 3rd, total 1,272 events.

This includes wide range of event types and difficulty levels, drawing from diverse real-world sources to capture the complexity encountered by professional analysts. We emphasize the following key aspects: Comprehensive Domain Coverage As introduced in Section 3.2, FutureX achieves comprehensive domain coverage through the daily curation of future events from 195 high-quality websites. Between July 20th and August 3rd, our dataset comprises 1,272 events, systematically categorized into 11 main domainsincluding politics, sports, crypto, culture, finance, business, technology trends, weather, health, and spaceeach further refined into several sub-categories.

This comprehensive domain coverage provides two key advantages: 1. It enables holistic assessment of LLM agents overall future prediction capabilities, as diverse fields often necessitate distinct analytical approaches and specialized reasoning strategies. 2. Coupled with FutureXs live updating, this breadth makes our benchmark significantly more robust against exploitation or overfitting, and we anticipate this will ensure it remains challenging and relevant evaluation for the foreseeable future.

Different Event Types FutureX includes four different event types: single-choice, multi-choice, open-ended ranking, and open-ended numerical prediction events.

In addition to events with predefined choices, FutureX features significant number of open-ended events, where no options are provided. Agents must actively search for and synthesize relevant historical information to make accurate predictions. There are two types of open-ended events: (1) ranking tasks, which typically involve forecasting the order of items on future leaderboard (e.g., music or movie popularity rankings), and (2) numerical prediction tasks, which require estimating specific numeric value (e.g., stock price or price index). As detailed in Section 3.2.2, we significantly downsampled binary yes-or-no eventsprimarily affecting single-choice questionsto increase the difficulty of the benchmark. As result, and as shown in Figure 5, the distribution of the remaining three event types is relatively balanced. Figure 5 Event type distribution (between July 20th and August 3rd). Figure 6 Difficulty level distribution (between July 20th and August 3rd). Different Volatility While all events in FutureX involve forecasting future outcomes, they vary significantly in how dynamic these outcomes are over time. This distinction is particularly important for open-ended eventsfor example, some leaderboards, such as all-time box office rankings, remain virtually unchanged over long periods, reflecting extremely low variability. Such events offer little predictive challenge and have therefore been excluded from our benchmark. To better characterize the remaining events, we analyze the volatility of each event based on historical data, measuring how much the target outcome is expected to fluctuate over time. We then tag open-ended events as either Low Volatility or High Volatility, which are visually indicated by different color depths in Figure 5. Difficulty Tiers Guided by event type and expected volatility (see Figure 6), we partition the benchmark 13 Table 3 Difficulty tiers and assessed agents skills in FutureX.

An overview of the 4 tiers and the specific agent skills they assess is given in Table 3. The examples of events corresponding to these 4 tiers are shown in Table 4 The Basic tier (Level 1) contains single-choice events with options fewer than 4. The predefined options sharply limit the search space, so information retrieval and reasoning are lightweight. With exactly one correct answer, this tier simply checks whether the agent can identify the most probable future outcome. The Wide Search tier (Level 2) comprises multi-choice events with several correct answers. The agent must submit the full set of valid options and nothing more: leaving out any true answer cuts the items score in half, whereas selecting even one wrong option reduces the score to zero. This tier requires more complex reasoning, and therefore tests whether the agent can perform exhaustive yet precise discrimination across multiple plausible options. The Deep Search tier (Level 3) contains open-ended events whose underlying facts are relatively stable (with low volatility). With no options provided, the agent must propose its own answer, performing multi-step search and reasoning to gather evidence. Because volatility is low, exhaustive information collection should converge on the correct response. This tier thus probes the agents ability to navigate, integrate, and synthesize reliable information when the search space is large but the target is steady. The Super Agent tier (Level 4) covers high-volatility, open-ended events. Here the agent must cast wide net for information and reason probabilistically under shifting signals and deep uncertainty. The task is taxing even for human expertslet alone machinesbecause the scenarios are complex, ambiguous, and resist simple fact retrieval. This tier therefore probes an agents super capacity for nuanced, uncertainty-aware forecasting in the most demanding real-world settings. As shown in Figure 6, after downsampling, Level 1 events are significantly reduced in number, resulting in more balanced distribution across the remaining three levels. This setup enables more comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents capabilities across varying degrees of difficulty. Notably, all Level 3 and Level 4 events are generated through our automated pipeline (see Figure 3), which supports scalable event creation while maintaining quality control. This marks key distinction from prior benchmarks [15, 30], where most events were relatively simple and collected directly from prediction market websites (see the comparison in Table 1)."

            "content": "Unlike traditional static benchmarks, where each query is associated with known answer, future prediction inherently lacks ground truth at the time of prediction, since the relevant events have not yet occurred. As result, FutureX introduces an evaluation delay, referring to the time gap between when prediction is made and when it can be evaluated. For example, suppose an agent makes predictions for several events on July 15th, with resolution dates ranging from July 16th to July 22nd. In this case, performance can only be evaluated after July 22nd, once all outcomes are known, resulting in an evaluation delay of one week. Intuitively, the length of the evaluation delay introduces tradeoff between Tradeoff in Delay Selection. event coverage and timeliness. longer delay allows the benchmark to include more events each day (e.g., many events may resolve within 100 days), but our evaluation pipeline faces more pressure (see Section 3.2.3), and the evaluation becomes less timely, as we must wait for those outcomes. Conversely, shorter delay improves timeliness (e.g., predicting only next-day events), but significantly reduces the number and diversity of events available, while also increasing the randomness of daily evaluations. Our Design Choice. To balance this tradeoff, FutureX adopts an one-week prediction window, which provides both sufficient event coverage and manageable evaluation latency. This setup not only smooths out day-to-day randomness but also creates more challenging prediction task, requiring models to reason about outcomes that are not immediately obvious. Moreover, it better reflects real-world use cases, where agents must make judgments about broader horizon of future events, not just what will happen tomorrow. In addition, the evaluation delay helps prevent overfitting to our live benchmark through frequent submissions. Since performance scores are not available immediately after predictions, model developers cannot directly optimize against recent feedback. This makes FutureX more robust and reliable as an evaluation framework."

            "title": "3.4.2 Dealing with Missing Predictions",
            "content": "Another challenge is handling missing predictions. Since the pipeline runs on daily basis, if model fails to produce prediction on given day, it cannot retroactively provide it later. Given the large number of models evaluated, as well as occasional API instability or cases where model may refuse to predict certain future events, missing predictions are inevitable. The ideal approach to handling missing predictions is to align the events across all models. However, because the events with missing predictions typically differ between models, full alignment would substantially reduce the total number of events, which is undesired. Based on our data, we first analyze the standard deviation (std) introduced by missing predictions using Monte Carlo simulation. Since we have roughly 500 events each week, in each simulation trial we first sample 500 events (with both results and predictions) and calculate the true average score si. We then randomly sample (100 κ)% of these events, where κ% denotes the missing ratio, varying from 1% to 20%, and compute the pseudo average score ˆsi. This process is repeated 20,000 times, after which we calculate the true standard deviation, Std(S), for {s1, . . . , s20000}, and the pseudo standard deviation, Std( ˆS), for 15 Figure 7 Standard deviation vs. missing rate. The missing rate κ ranges from 1% to 20%; for each model, we plot the standard deviation of its average score. {ˆs1, . . . , ˆs20000}. The pseudo standard deviation is plotted in Figure 7 against the missing rate. In addition, we quantify the relative increase in standard deviation ((Std( ˆS) Std(S))/Std(S)) with respect to missing predictions in Figure 16. The results indicate that the standard deviation remains relatively small. These values are computed from 500 total samples, which roughly corresponds to one week of data. As FutureX progresses and the test size grows, the standard deviation is expected to decrease at rate proportional to the inverse square root of the sample size. Therefore, given the complexity of the auto-evaluation pipeline and the relatively minor impact of missing predictions, we prioritize increasing the test sample size over strict alignment, allowing for slight misalignments across different models."

As for single-choice events, the metric is simply the 0-1 error: score(Y, ˆY ) = I(Y = ˆY ). For multi-choice events, as the answer contains multiple right options (denoted by Y), the metric is as follows: score(Y, ˆY) = F1-Score(Y, ˆY). For open-ended ranking events, such as predicting the top-k ranked items, we treat the ground truth as an ordered list, denoted by {y1, . . . , yk}. To evaluate predictions {ˆy1, . . . , ˆyk}, we design the following metric: score({y1, . . . , yk}, {ˆy1, . . . , ˆyk}) = (cid:40) 1, 0.8 {y1,...,yk}{ˆy1,...,ˆyk} if yi = ˆyi, for = 1, . . . , , otherwise, where partial credit (80%) is awarded based on the overlap between the predicted and ground-truth sets.

Specifically, we define the score as: score(Y, ˆY ) = max 0, 1 (cid:32) ˆY σ(Y ) (cid:33)2 , where σ(Y ) denotes the standard deviation of the outcome over the past 7 days. Intuitively, predictions that fall within one standard deviation of the true outcome receive partial credit, while those beyond one standard deviation receive score of zero."

            "content": "We show seperate results across 4 difficulty tiers in Figure 8. Our main findings are as follows: Finding 1. Our difficulty tiers accurately reflect the complexity of the events. We observe clear, consistent decline in performance across the 4 defined difficulty tiers, which strongly supports the validity of our task stratification. Models achieve high accuracy on Levels 1 and 2, but their performance drops significantly on Level 3 and, in particular, on Level 4. This trend indicates that our difficulty labels effectively correspond to increasing levels of task complexity. Furthermore, by comparing Figure 9 and Figure 10, we find that even within the same domain, model performance declines substantially. 4We are actively working to integrate Gemini-2.5-pro (Think&Search), which will be added soon. However, due to policy constraints and API stability concerns, we are currently unable to integrate Claude models and OpenAIs Deep Research. Besides, since GPT-o1/o3/o4-mini (base LLM) often refuse to make predictions, we do not show them in the final results. 5As AgentOrchestra [45] is quite time-consuming, we only test it for Level 1 and 2 events. Therefore, we do not include it into our overall results. (a) Level 1: Basic Tier (b) Level 2: Wide Search Tier (c) Level 3: Deep Search Tier (d) Level 4: Super Agent Tier Figure 8 Overall results of different difficulty tiers (between July 20th and August 3rd). Note that since AgentOrchestra is computationally intensive, we evaluate it with only two backbone models for only Level 1 and 2 events. 18 In particular, Level 4 events, which are open-ended and highly volatile, pose significant challenges for current models. These tasks often demand multi-step reasoning, synthesis of ambiguous or incomplete information, long-horizon forecasting, and deeper understanding of world knowledge and strategic thinking. In our experiments, most models struggle to generate correct responses for these events, and even the strongest models often fail to score at all. In fact, these tasks are so complex that they not only test the limits of current models, but may also serve as benchmark for measuring superhuman performance in future systems. Overall, the consistent alignment between model performance and task difficulty confirms the soundness of our evaluation design and highlights the unique value of our benchmark in assessing LLMs at different levels of capabilityfrom basic factual recall to complex, real-world reasoning. Level 1 and level 2 events are designed as Finding 2. Base LLMs perform well on Level 1 and Level 2 events. relatively simple single/multi-choice questions. Our results show that even base LLMswithout tool usage or advanced reasoning capabilitiesconsistently achieve high accuracy on these tasks. Notably, DouBao-Seed1.6Thinking outperforms several agents equipped with web search tools, including the two Deep Research agents. We propose several possible explanations for this phenomenon: These events may primarily rely on basic factual recall or straightforward reasoning, which base LLMs are already capable of handling without external tools. Another possibility is that achieving around 60% accuracy on these events does not demand extensive searching. Furthermore, the current generation of agents may lack sufficiently advanced search capabilities to significantly exceed this threshold, suggesting that their retrieval strategies do not outperform the inherent knowledge stored in base models. This finding also suggests that Level 1 and Level 2 events are not sufficiently challenging to distinguish between models of varying capabilities. While they are useful for establishing performance baseline, they offer limited insight when evaluating more advanced language models. Accordingly, the weights of these two tiers in our overall score (see Figure 1) are set to 10% and 20%, respectively. These observations further validate our decision to downsample Level 1 events in our benchmark. They also underscore the advantage of FutureX over prior benchmarks that predominantly feature Level 1 events derived from prediction markets. Finding 3. Search/tool usage becomes increasingly important for harder events. As the complexity of the events increases, particularly in Level 3, models that incorporate external tools such as web search, calculators, or code execution tend to perform significantly better than those that rely solely on static knowledge. This highlights the critical role of tool-augmented reasoning in handling complex, multi-step problems that cannot be solved through pre-trained information alone. Moreover, many of the harder events, especially open-ended ones, involve dynamic or real-world developments where up-to-date information is essential. In such cases, models without access to real-time search are often unable to produce meaningful answers, as the required knowledge may not exist in their training data. This is particularly evident in domains like current affairs, emerging technologies, or ongoing geopolitical situations, where factual accuracy depends on retrieving the most recent context. This further demonstrates that FutureX is capable of analyzing advanced search capabilities that are closely linked to reasoning. Finding 4. DouBao-Seed1.6-Thinking excels in knowledge retrieval (Level 1 and Level 2), and Grok-4 Among base demonstrates exceptional performance on more difficult events (Level 3 and Level 4). LLMs, we find that DouBao-Seed1.6-Thinking performs best on Level 1 and Level 2 events. Notably, it even outperforms agents equipped with search tools as well as deep research models.

These participants comprised current or former employees from the Big Four accounting firms (e.g., KPMG), top consulting firms (e.g., McKinsey), and nine leading investment banks (e.g., UBS). We randomly sampled 300 questions from our test bank and had these experts answer them independently, then computed their average scores on the same evaluation metrics (red dotted lines). As shown in Figure 8, humans significantly outperform LLM agents on Level 1, Level 3, and Level 4 events, indicating thatdespite their promiseLLMs still have considerable ground to cover before matching human expertise. Conversely, for Level 2 events, some models actually surpass human performance; this may be because these multi-choice questions involve so many options that people often cannot exhaustively compare every possibility. Overall, these results underscore the substantial potential for LLM agents to aidand eventually rivalhumans in forecasting future events. Note that because the human annotations and model tests did not use exactly the same question set, these comparisons should be viewed as rough indicators.

Given the performance gap between Level 1&2 and Level 3&4, we draw two set of figures respectively. Several interesting observations include: Different models have different strengths. GPT modelsincluding GPT-4.1 (Base LLM), GPT-4.1 (SmolAgent), and GPT-o4-mini (Think&Search)demonstrate superior performance in Crypto and Technology. DouBao-Seed1.6-Thinking excels in Finance&Economy and Business&Companies, while DeepSeek-V3 (SmolAgent) performs exceptionally well in Politics, even outperforming closed-source deep-research agents and Think&Search LLMs. Search-enhanced reasoning significantly improves performance in information-driven domains. For domains like Culture & Media and Technology, performance increases notably as we move from basic to more advanced reasoning frameworks. This is likely because these domains benefit directly from timely information access and contextual reasoning grounded in real-world updates. Tool using increases the performance differences. As shown in Figure 9, for Level 1 and Level 2 events, the performance differences among the base LLMs are not very large, but as tools are added, the gaps in the radar charts widen, likely reflecting each models choice of search tools and reasoning style. Advanced searching alone may not be sufficient in complex, abstract domains. In contrast, for Level 3 and Level 4 events (see Figure 10), even models equipped with strong search capabilities struggle to perform well. These open-ended tasks often demand deeper abstraction, multi-hop reasoning, and synthesis of heterogeneous information, revealing potential limitation in the current design of search-augmented agents."

We randomly select 30 events from Level 1 and Level 2, then evaluate model performance on two tasks: predicting outcomes before they are known (future prediction) and searching outcomes after they have been resolved (past prediction). To more precisely assess search capability, we introduce past-prediction task in which models retrieve each events outcome one week after its resolution date. Using the same set of 30 randomly selected events from Level 1 and Level 27, we report performance scores for both past-prediction and future-prediction in Figure 12. In the figure, dark bars represent past-prediction results, while shallow bars represent future-prediction results. From the results, we find that: Grok-4 leads in search capability, followed by GPT models and Hunyuan. In the past-prediction task, Grok-4 significantly outperforms all other methods, underscoring its robust and timely information retrieval. GPT-o4-mini and GPT-4o also deliver strong past-prediction performance. Interestingly, although Hunyuan achieves impressive past-prediction results, the large gap between its futureand past-prediction scores suggests weaker reasoning abilitymeaning that despite effective search, its overall performance suffers. SmolAgent with Gemini-2.5-pro achieves significant gains, unlike with other base LLMs. Within the open-source SmolAgent framework, integrating Gemini-2.5-pro yields marked improvement in past-prediction performancecomparable to most commercial models (except Grok-4). Crucially, this demonstrates that SmolAgents relatively modest overall performance cannot be blamed solely on the quality of its search API. By contrast, when paired with other base LLMs, SmolAgent shows little to no improvementand in some cases, even performance declinesuggesting that the underlying search capabilities of those models play significant role in the agents effectiveness."

            "title": "4.5.2 Planning Analysis of SmolAgent",
            "content": "To understand the agents performance, we examine the agent memory of SmolAgent when paired with different LLM backends. As we cannot access the internal memory of closed-source models, our analysis focuses on SmolAgent. SmolAgents memory contains plan to solve the problem, detailed log of tool usage, and the outcome of each tool call in every iteration, providing rich foundation for our analysis. Examples of full memory are shown in Appendix B. For each study plan generated by an agent, we first conduct an evaluation using Gemini-2.5-pro, which assigns score ranging from 0 to 10 across three key dimensions: (1) comprehensiveness (assessing the extent to which the plan covers all necessary components and relevant information), (2) source reliability (evaluating the credibility and validity of references or data cited in the plan), and (3) plan actionability (measuring how practical and executable the proposed steps are in real-world scenarios). To ensure the fairness and objectivity of the evaluation process, we anonymize the model identity by replacing the original model name in the prompt with generic label model-i (where is unique numerical identifier). 7We focus on Level 1 and Level 2 events because their outcomes are more readily retrievable. 23 This anonymity mechanism is designed to prevent Gemini-2.5-pro from exhibiting potential bias, specifically, avoiding any tendency to inflate scores for study plans generated by models within the Gemini series. By eliminating such identity-based influences, we aim to obtain more accurate and unbiased assessment results that truly reflect the quality of each study plan. As shown in Table 5, GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-pro obtained significantly higher planning scores compared to other models. This result is consistent with their superior overall performance demonstrated in Figure 2, which suggests strong relationship between an agents planning capability and its future-prediction performance. closer look at Table 5 reveals key differences in how models approach planning: Comprehensiveness: Powerful models like GPT-4.1 earn high scores for comprehensiveness by generating plans that address wide array of specific and sophisticated risk factors. In contrast, weaker models like Qwen3-32B produce plans that are often superficial, covering only basic elements and lacking the necessary depth or specific guidance. Source Reliability: We observed that strong models like GPT-4.1 consistently leverage authoritative and specialized sources for information. Conversely, weaker models such as Qwen3-32B frequently pull information from unvetted sources like Twitter, compromising the reliability of their plans. Plan Actionability: Interestingly, certain models, including Deepseek-v3, sometimes reach conclusion within the planning phase itself. This behavior suggests that these models may not always rely on search tools to solve problems, instead leveraging their internal knowledge base to form final plan.

Specifically, we evaluate the forecasting capabilities of large language models (LLMs) against sell-side analysts consensus estimates for S&P 500 companies.

In this study, we obtain the professional analysts prediction directly from yahoo finance. The task involves generating point forecasts for Q2 2025. Model performance is assessed using two metrics: (1) Win Rate, which measures the proportion of instances where an LLMs prediction is closer to the actual value than the consensus estimate; and (2) Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), defined as the absolute percentage error between the prediction and the ground truth, with values above 30% capped to mitigate the influence of outliers. Moreover, we consider cases with revenue difference within 0.5% or an EPS difference within 1% as ties, the results are shown in Figure 15. Our results show that leading LLMs (Think&Search) are beginning to exhibit meaningful capabilities in financial future prediction. In the context of Q2 2025 earnings predictions, the top-performing models are able to outperform professional sell-side analysts on 37.5% of revenue prediction tasks and 32.3% of EPS (earnings per share) prediction tasks. Importantly, most model-generated forecasts are accompanied by plausible reasoning, and the overall prediction errors are not significantly larger than those of human analysts, suggesting that LLMs are developing foundational level of financial judgment. Among the models evaluated,9 Gemini-2.5-pro emerges as the most competitive, achieving average win rates of 33.0% and 33.7% for revenue and EPS predictions, respectively (ties excluded).

Ways to Generate Fake Websites. The fake website is constructed through an iterative, LLM-assisted process. Beginning with predefined question and targeted (often implausible) answer, we use Gemini-2.5-Pro to generate persuasive, realistic-looking web content that supports the desired prediction. This content is then deployed to public-facing site. We embed the fake URL into query and submit it to Deep Research Agents, collecting their responses. If the agent is successfully misled, the process concludes. Otherwise, we feed the Deep Research Agents response back into Gemini-2.5-pro, asking it to summarize the failure reasons and refine the website contentthus forming feedback loop for iterative optimization. Results. Across all 5 examples, GPT-o3 Deep Research, Seed 1.6 (DouBao Deep Research), and Qwen3-235B Deep Research were consistently misled by the fabricated website, despite retrieving information from multiple additional sources. In contrast, Gemini-2.5-Pro Deep Research remained unaffected. Notably, it refused to cite the fake siteeven when explicitly prompted to visit itand did not incorporate its content into the final prediction. One possible explanation is that Gemini may rely on more robust backend statistics or detailed domain-level credibility assessments (e.g., via Google Search), which help it identify low-quality or newly registered sites. This case study highlights the potentially serious risks associated with deploying recent Deep Research Agents in real-world, high-stakes applications. While we present only an initial exploration of these vulnerabilities, we believe this is an important direction for the broader research community to investigate further."

In this case study, we aim to evaluate whether state-of-the-art closed-source Deep Research Agents and LLMs (Think&Search), including GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-pro, Seed 1.6 (DouBao), and Qwen3-235B, are capable of retrieving and utilizing real-time data to support decision-making. Specifically, we focus on high-temporal-sensitivity scenarios, such as ongoing sports events, where immediate access to up-to-date developments is essential for accurate forecasting or in-the-moment judgment. 30 We design scenarios in which the agent is asked to gather the most recent information about live event, for example, the current score or key updates during game, and we compare the agents response against real-time ground truth. This setup not only tests the agents ability to query the open web effectively, but also its responsiveness to fresh, low-signal data that often appears on the internet shortly after an event unfolds. Experiment Scenarios. Due to the operational challenges of evaluating agents in real time, we construct only five representative examples instead of conducting large-scale testing. In particular, we assess the agents ability to retrieve real-time match scores during the MSI (Mid-Season Invitational) esports tournament, task that is both time-sensitive and relatively underrepresented in typical pretraining corpora. The key difficulty lies in the limited availability of structured information immediately following or during each game, combined with the high demand for freshness and accuracy. The matches follow best-of-five format, and after each game (with 10-minute delay), we ask both LLM (Think&Search) agents and Deep Research models to report the current score. Importantly, we introduce 10-minute delay before each query to ensure that updated match results are already available on major Chinese and English websites. This step helps minimize the likelihood that the observed performance gap is simply due to temporary information unavailability. Results. We find clear performance hierarchy among the four Deep Research Agents: GPT-o3 Deep Research demonstrated the strongest real-time retrieval capability, followed by Seed 1.6 (DouBao Deep Research), then Gemini-2.5-pro Deep Research, while Qwen3-235B Deep Research consistently failed to retrieve up-to-date results. Surprisingly, we observed that in some cases, the performance of dedicated Deep Research Agents was on par withor even slightly worse thanthat of general-purpose Think&Search models, suggesting that specialized research agents do not yet offer clear advantage in real-time settings. This study focuses on single task type, real-time sports event tracking, which may not Limitations. generalize across all domains. The results should therefore be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive. Nevertheless, this case study highlights critical shortcoming in the current design of Deep Research Agents (as well as the Think&Search mode): the ability to handle time-sensitive, low-signal environments remains limited and warrants further investigation."

Based on comprehensive review of the available intelligence and public records for this period, there have been no reported deaths directly resulting from the civil unrest. Key evidence supporting this conclusion includes: 1. Detailed accounts of the June 2025 Los Angeles riots consistently omit any mention of fatalities. 2. Subsequent protests in July 2025 across the state were predominantly non-lethal in nature. 3. The tragic deaths of three Los Angeles County Sheriffs deputies in an explosion were explicitly identified as an isolated, non-riot-related incident, as they occurred during the handling of explosive devices as an occupational hazard. 4. This events lack of fatalities stands in stark contrast to historical precedents like the 1965 Watts Riots (34 deaths) and the 1992 Los Angeles Riots (50-63 deaths), highlighting significant difference in outcomes. Based on the exhaustive review of the provided data, the estimated number of deaths to claim during the riots in California until the end of July 2025 is 0.

Injuries total around 2040 (affecting protesters, officers, journalists, and others), with over 575 arrests. Two potential incidents were investigated: - farmworker died on July 12 after falling during an ICE raid on July 10 (accidental, while fleeing; occurred amid protest at the site but not from riot violence). - body was found near looting site on June 10, but showed no trauma and the cause remains unknown/unlinked to the unrest. Neither is attributed as riot-related fatality in official reports or media summaries. Given the protests contained nature, reduced troop presence, and lack of fatalities over 1.5 months, it is unlikely significant escalation or deaths will occur in the remaining 6 days through July 31.

Based on this erroneous, self-created fact, the model naturally ruled out the possibility of zero deaths and concluded that the final toll would fall within the 11-15 range.

            "title": "Prediction",
            "content": "Current Situation and Historical Context The 2025 California riots began in early June, triggered by large-scale raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeless Latino-majority communities. On June 6, ICE arrested 44 undocumented immigrants at seven locations, including shopping malls and factories. This action quickly sparked intense community protests, which evolved into ongoing social unrest. By June 11, the incidents had spread to major California cities like San Francisco and San Diego, with over 5,000 arrests statewide, 12 deaths, and direct economic losses exceeding $800 million. The situation escalated further in July. On July 3, the Trump administration deployed an additional 700 Marine Corps soldiers to California, reinforcing federal control over the state. These troops joined the 4,000 38 National Guard soldiers already on the ground to maintain order in cities like Los Angeles. However, California Governor Gavin Newsom deemed the move unconstitutional, further intensifying the conflict between the two sides. On July 10, federal agents clashed with protesters during an immigration raid on Southern California farm. On-site video footage showed helmeted law enforcement officers throwing tear gas, forcing protesters and workers to retreat as thick smoke engulfed the area, affecting even children. This operation resulted in one death and multiple injuries. On July 18, an explosion at the Biscaluz Training Center in Los Angeles County killed three veteran police officers instantly. The incident was caused by an unexploded device discovered the day before in Santa Monica apartment garage, which detonated accidentally during handling, brutally exposing fatal flaw in the law enforcements high-risk materials handling protocol. Compared to historical California riots, the 2025 unrest shows new characteristics. The 1992 Los Angeles riots were triggered by the acquittal of white police officers who beat black motorist Rodney King. The riots lasted six days, caused 63 deaths, and resulted in $1 billion in damages. In contrast, the 2025 riots are centered on immigration policy and have evolved into power struggle between the federal and state governments. It is noteworthy that although the scale of the 2025 riots is considerable, the current death toll (around 13) remains far below the 63 fatalities of 1992. This suggests that the current situation has not reached the same level of violence as historical highs, but given the ongoing conflict and escalating confrontation, the developments over the next week require close attention. Key Data and Influencing Factors According to statistics from reliable sources, as of July 24, 2025, the California riots have resulted in approximately 13 deaths: 1. By June 11, 12 deaths had been confirmed. 2. On July 10, the Southern California farm raid resulted in 1 death. 3. On July 18, the explosion at the Los Angeles County training center caused the deaths of three police officers, but whether this incident is directly related to the riots is yet to be confirmed. It is important to emphasize that the above statistics may have omissions, especially considering other violent conflicts or accidental events that may occur during the riots. The power struggle between the federal and state governments is key factor influencing the development of the riots. Since taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has labeled undocumented immigrants national security threat, setting goal of 3,000 daily arrests and attempting to seal the U.S.-Mexico border. This policy directly impacts Californias economy and social structure, as the states economy is highly dependent on immigrant labor, particularly in the agricultural and construction sectors. California Governor Newsom strongly opposes the federal governments intervention, publicly accusing Trumps actions of being unconstitutional and describing it as constitutional war. He believes the White Houses goal is to weaken state power and set precedent for federal intervention in state affairs. This political antagonism not only exacerbates social divisions but also makes it difficult to resolve the conflict through conventional means. The federal government has deployed large number of military forces to California. In addition to the 700 Marine Corps soldiers, this includes the 40th Infantry Division of the National Guard and rapid response forces from the Department of Homeland Security. These troops, equipped with riot gear, light armored vehicles, and armed helicopters, have established temporary posts at several strategic locations in Los Angeles. The escalation of law enforcement tactics is also significant factor in the increase of casualties. On-site videos show law enforcement officers using tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbang grenades to suppress crowds. This high-intensity enforcement not only directly causes casualties but also easily escalates tensions, leading to further conflict. Prediction for the Next Week Key factors influencing the death toll include: 1. Progress of negotiations between the federal and state governments: If both sides can reach compromise, it may ease tensions and reduce violent clashes. 2. Scale and intensity of protest activities: During the Independence Day period, protests of varying scales were held in many parts of the United States, from Chicago to Los Angeles, from Roanoke, Virginia, to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Eugene, Oregon. Such large-scale protests carry high risk of violence. 3. Changes in enforcement intensity: If law enforcement continues to use high-intensity suppression tactics, it may lead to more casualties. 39 4. Economic factors: As the worlds fourth-largest economy, Californias economic interests may prompt all parties to seek peaceful resolution. Expert analysis points out that there are fundamental differences between these riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The 1992 riots stemmed primarily from racial discrimination and judicial injustice, while the 2025 conflict is more the result of political maneuvering. In the 1992 riots, the jurys acquittal of the four police officers involved sparked six-day riot, causing 53 deaths, over two thousand injuries, and property damage estimated at over $1 billion. Currently, the death toll from the 2025 riots (around 13) is significantly lower than the 1992 level. This is partly due to faster response from law enforcement and also reflects the differences in the organization and intensity of the current protests. However, with the escalation of the confrontation between the federal and state governments, the situation could still worsen. Considering the fatality trend over the past month and the current situation, we can make the following predictions: 1. Most Likely Scenario: An increase of 02 deaths in the coming week, bringing the total to 1315. This prediction is based on the current relatively stable death toll trend and the likely scale of conflicts. 2. Optimistic Scenario: If the federal and state governments can reach compromise and protests remain peaceful, there may be no new deaths in the coming week, keeping the total at around 13. 3. Pessimistic Scenario: If the conflict escalates further, especially if large-scale violent events similar to 1992 occur, the death toll could increase significantly. However, given the current military deployment and law enforcement capabilities, the possibility of this happening is relatively low. Final Prediction and Conclusion Taking into account historical data, the current situation, and future trends, my prediction for the total number of fatalities in the California riots by the end of July 2025 is as follows: B. 1--5 fatalities: This option clearly underestimates the actual situation, as the death toll has already reached around 13 as of July 24. C. 6--10 fatalities: This option is also below the actual situation, as the current death toll is already over 10. D. 11--15 fatalities: This is the most likely scenario. Based on the current death toll of around 13 and the prediction of possible increase of 02 deaths in the coming week, the total number of fatalities is most likely to fall within this range. E. 16--20 fatalities: While this possibility cannot be completely ruled out, it would require multiple severe violent incidents to occur in the coming week to reach this level, making it relatively less probable. F. 21--25 fatalities and G. Over 25 fatalities: These two scenarios would require significant escalation in the scale and intensity of the conflict. Given the current military deployment and political environment, these are highly unlikely. Final Prediction: The most probable death toll range is D. 11--15 people. Risk Assessment and Uncertainties stemming primarily from the following factors: It must be emphasized that this prediction contains degree of uncertainty, 1. Changes in political factors: The relationship between the federal and state governments could change significantly in short time, affecting the situations development. 2. Possibility of external intervention: Other political forces or international factors might intervene, altering the nature and intensity of the conflict. 3. Impact of sudden events: Unexpected incidents, such as the July 18 explosion, could cause sudden increase in the death toll. 4. Unpredictability of protest activities: The development of large-scale protests is often uncertain and can escalate or subside rapidly. Despite these uncertainties, based on existing data and analysis, we have reason to believe that the total number of fatalities from the California riots by the end of July 2025 is most likely to fall within the 1115 range. 40 Examples of SmolAgents planning Smolagent [26] is an open-source agent framework where the planning of agents is visible.
