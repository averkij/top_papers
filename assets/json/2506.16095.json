INTRODUCTION Wind energy is one of the most important sources of renewable energy used to mitigate the climate change effects; however, increasing the efficiency of the wind turbines is still an engineering issue. It has been found that predictive maintenance where machine learning and data analytics are used has the potential of making huge difference in the reliability and performance of turbines. For example, Schlechtingen and Santos [1] showed that it is possible to monitor the condition of the system by the means of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data to predict failures and minimise the time of breakdowns. Such models enable early fault detection, reduce maintenance expenses and improve energy generation. Furthermore, there is an emergence of intelligent operation and maintenance (O&M) systems to monitor and optimize turbines in operation [2]. Therefore, for the wind energy sector, as the market expands further more sophisticated and efficient predictive models and smart O&M strategies are crucial for achieving better results and cutting further costs down. A. Problem Statement associated with unexpected turbine failures and system downtime. Traditional maintenance strategies are reactive, leading to costly repairs and prolonged downtime, which negatively affect energy output. Moreover, the current predictive models used in wind farms are often not optimized for real-world conditions, limiting their effectiveness. There is critical need to enhance predictive maintenance and optimize intelligent operation and maintenance (O&M) systems efficient wind power generation while minimizing operational disruptions.

LITERATURE REVIEW A. Predictive Maintenance Models for Reducing Downtime in Wind Turbines The application of predictive maintenance (PdM) models in wind turbines is critical for reducing system downtime by predicting component failures before they occur. These models typically rely on various forms of data, including vibration, temperature, and operational data, to monitor the health of the turbine and its components. By leveraging advanced algorithms, PdM systems can analyze this data to detect early signs of wear and tear, allowing maintenance to be performed proactively rather than reactively."

            "content": "For example, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which collect real-time operational data, XXX-X-XXXX-XXXX-X/XX/$XX.00 20XX IEEE have been widely used to monitor wind turbine conditions and predict failures. Zaher et al[3]. (2009) demonstrated how SCADA data could be analyzed to predict potential failures, allowing maintenance teams to schedule repairs before breakdown occurs. This approach reduces downtime and maintenance costs while improving energy generation efficiency. However, predictive models based solely on SCADA data face significant challenges, such as noisy sensor readings and missing data, which can compromise their reliability. To address these issues, researchers have increasingly explored the integration of advanced techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), deep learning, and ensemble learning, to enhance the accuracy of PdM models. For instance, Wuest et al[4]. (2016) proposed an ensemble learning-based approach that combines multiple machine learning algorithms to improve fault detection accuracy. This method has shown promising results in identifying major component failures, such as rotor blade faults, with greater precision and speed. However, require continuous updates to adapt to the changing conditions of turbines and their operational environments, and they often come with high computational costs. these models The integration of data-driven and knowledge-driven techniques is increasingly recognized as critical approach to improving the reliability of PdM architectures and reducing false positive alarms. Cheng et al. (2022) emphasize that combining these techniques allows for more accurate and robust fault detection. Moreover, the use of visual analytics, particularly when displayed via intuitive dashboards, enhances the ability of maintenance personnel to respond promptly and identify effective preventive measures. These dashboards provide real-time insights into turbine health, enabling maintenance teams to prioritize actions based on the severity of detected anomalies[17]. Despite the advancements in PdM algorithms over the past decades, significant challenge persists: the lack of labeled failure data in the manufacturing industry. This the development and validation of limitation restricts predictive models, ultimately affecting their real-world applicability. Addressing these challenges is crucial for ensuring the seamless implementation of PdM with minimal human intervention (Cheng et al., 2022)[17]. As such, more research is needed to improve data quality, reduce false alarms, and enhance the integration of real-time data with predictive maintenance models. For instance, Wuest et al. [4] developed an ensemble learning-based technique for accurate fault detection in the turbine based on multiple machine learning algorithms. This strategy proved much more effective compared to the conventional methods in analyzing failures of major components, like rotor blades, with higher precision and in issues with such less approaches to real wind farms, mainly, related to the computational costs and the fact that these models have to be updated through time to adapt to the changing conditions of the turbines. time. However, there are still B. Optimization of Intelligent O&M Systems for Wind failures. Power Efficiency Optimizing intelligent O&M systems is another key factor that defines the improvement of wind turbines by In means of data analysis and assessment of conventional methods, operation and maintenance are mostly detective in nature focusing on turbine problems after they develop into failure causing expensive time-outs. While, the intelligent operation and maintenance systems use the artificial neural network and big data analysis for failure prediction and best probable time of maintenance. For instance, Feng et al [6] analyzed how machine-learning methods could be used for improving maintenance schedule and decrease the time that the turbines are out of service while increasing energy generation. The advanced tools the real operating conditions. Digital for enhancing operation and maintenance systems are the digital twin technology that produces the realistic models of the real turbines to perform under twins help operators detect faults in advance and make decisions identifying potential for improving utilisation. Tao et al [7] pointed out that when digital twin was incorporated with AI algorithms, it increased efficiency in fault detection, lowered maintenance expenses, increased energy yield through tweaking the operation of the turbine when it was in line with differing environmental conditions. intelligent operations Nevertheless, some challenges are still present in implementing and maintenance systems. According to Zhang et al. [8] the deployment of Advanced AI-enabled systems on greater scale, substantial volumes of high-quality data as well as high processing power are necessary and make it expensive. Furthermore, the incorporation of time data from various sources, including weather conditions and turbine health also poses another challenge in developing complex model, which these challenges can be cannot be scalable. However, addressed by the sustained evolution of hybrid techniques that integrate real-time monitoring data and the historical record to enhance decision-making on wind turbine reliability and efficiency. real Fig. 1. Procedure of fault prediction based on SCADA and ANN (Source: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Procedure-of-fault-prediction-basedon-SCADA-and-ANN_fig3_326013496) C. Literature Gap Despite the positive results shown by the predictive maintenance models and intelligent O&M systems, some issues would still be faced when applying these solutions in large turbines. Current literature has ignored the need to finetune these models for different types of turbines and various operating environments. Furthermore, methods for real-time and big data integration spanning across different application domains that are cost-effective and easily scalable are yet to be developed fully. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to address these gaps by investigating the potential of predictive maintenance for improving O&M systems efficiency in wind power generation and identifying possible improvements for intelligent O&M systems. III. METHODOLOGY In this study, the research method adopted is qualitative and involves the analysis of predictive maintenance models and O&M optimisation of wind power systems. Data was obtained through the use of structured interviews with key informants comprising of three wind farm engineers and two maintenance managers. The thematic analysis was performed in an attempt to find out the patterns and the insights within the gathered data. This approach offers comprehensive picture of practice-based reality. Fig. 2 illustrates the visual representation of the research methodology proposed for the current study. proactive in the monitoring of the turbine efficiency as well as in the formulation of the maintenance techniques to be adopted. These professionals can give more pragmatic understanding of the operational use of intelligent O&M systems, as well as discussing the shortcomings of the typical predictive maintenance solutions C. Study Sample In this study, five participants have been chosen to be interviewed. The sample is made up of three wind farm engineers and two operation and maintenance managers with working experience in the wind energy industry. These individuals were selected because they have practical and hands-on engagement with the Wind Turbines for their dayto-day functioning and maintenance. This affords them the much-needed, real-world knowledge regarding predictive maintenance systems, and the practicality of fine-tuning O&M efficiency, which fits well with research purpose and objectives. Instead, smaller sample size was adopted to ensure that the interviews conducted were comprehensive and in-depth as well as to keep the themes manageable for analysis. D. Data Analysis The data obtained through the interviews was analyzed using thematic analysis as the approach. This approach is ideal for pattern finding and analysis or reporting themes within qualitative information.

Another farm engineer said that the models fail to capture slow, progressive failures that affect turbines effectiveness. maintenance manager commented that while these models cut downtime by 20%, false alarms constantly emerge, thereby resulting in unneeded actions. In general, participants recognized the usefulness of the models but pointed to the need for more accurate fault identification and less false alarms to ensure advanced effectiveness. Yang et al. [9] have also made similar observations, where predictive models have high success rates in cases of larger and more critical turbine faults but are less efficient at identifying relatively-small early-stage problems, especially in the older turbines. Likewise, Kusiak et al. [10] noted that false alarms, which arise due to sensor errors or changes in environmental factors, continue to be chief challenge in the application of predictive maintenance. It is evident from these studies that predictive maintenance has come long way in enhancing room for wind turbine performance, but improvement in the models accuracy in order to eliminate unnecessary iterations of maintenance. there is still B.

Effectiveness of Predictive Maintenance Models Predictive maintenance models are essential in wind power systems to reduce and avoid system downtime due to failures. Many participants mentioned stages in which the the models were majority of issues are identified, but criticized for failing to detect minor gradual errors. Both the models also lack real time accuracy and compatibility with the older systems of turbines reducing efficiency. Some of the participant responses concerning the effectiveness of predictive maintenance models are provided below: Farm Engineer Current models are helpful but require enhancements in the ability to identify minor problems before they turn into more significant ones. Although, with the application of predictive maintenance models, equipment downtime have been minimized prediction of small faults, which may lead to more catastrophic faults, is still challenge. Maintenance Manager The models work quite well, especially identifying large problems but they are less accurate especially during inclement weather. Real-time could be optimised to enhance the accuracy in avoiding unnecessary shutdowns. Farm Engineer Other models have seen decrease in downtime by up to about 20% thereby enhancing the efficiency of the turbines. Nevertheless, the false alarms occur more often and result in improper interventions and inefficient usage of resources that harm organizational productivity."

In terms of maintenance, maintenance manager stated that many sensors were not reliable due to the fact that they often produced wrong data. maintenance manager highlighted problem of information overload to the extent that it hampers decision making processes. Such issues include variation in SCADA data from remote areas and, thus, require the integration of the model, refined sensors, and better data management for more efficient predictive maintenance. These results are in line with the outcomes presented by Tian et al. [11], whose analysis revealed data inconsistency and integration difficulties when implementing predictive maintenance models for aged wind turbines. Similarly, Reder et al.

CONCLUSION Wind energy is becoming more critical as society moves from the traditional technique of using fossil fuels as the major source of energy in electricity generation, but this has been an issue in the efficiency of the turbine. It is noted that predictive maintenance models and O&M systems equipped with cognitive functions are currently pointed as the adequate tools that should be implemented to minimize downtime, optimize annual energy production and guarantee the dependability of wind turbines. Still, the performance of these models and systems in practice is questionable, problematic issues like data quality and quantification of false alarms, as well as integration into systems with old types of turbines. These challenges are the primary reasons for conducting this research to evaluate the predictive maintenance models and to identify the methods of improving optimization of intelligent O&M systems. Therefore, the current study utilized qualitative research approach through conducting structured interviews to five wind farm engineers as well as maintenance managers. Some of these participants, who have years of industry experience, offered rich descriptions of the application of these technologies in practice. The interviews conducted were analysed using thematic analysis to enable the study to identify pertinent themes about the challenges as well as possibilities of enhancing predictive maintenance and O&M systems The results pointed out on the observation that major fault modelling for predictive maintenance are efficient in their senate and capability of reducing downtime due to overall major faults while they fails to factor the minor gradual faults which brings inefficiencies to the overall issues like, malfunction of sensors, operation. Further, existence of false alarms, and the complexity of retrofitting new models with older turbines were often raised. Nonetheless, different technologies such as simulations of digital twin, systems for the control and data acquisition SCADA, and condition monitoring have greatly improved the schedule for maintenance and fault identification. Thus, these technologies show significant opportunities, however, certain developments are still the enhancements of the real-time data integration, AI model, and the sensors. Eliminating these gaps will enhance the efficiency of the turbines, decrease general costs of operation, and improve the effectiveness of wind energy, which in return will enhance the utilization of renewable energy. required, especially, A.
