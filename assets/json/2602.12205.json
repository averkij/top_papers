            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "Advancing image generation and editing to handle increasingly complex instructions requires models that go beyond mere pixel synthesis to possess deep semantic understanding. To meet this demand, promising paradigm has emerged that integrates the comprehensive capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with the generative power of diffusion models, aiming to achieve semantically accurate generation and precise editing. Closed-source systems such as GPT-Image-1 [1] and Nano Banana [2] have validated this potential. In the open-source domain, recent wave of models, including BAGEL [3], HunyuanImage 3.0 [4], Qwen-Image [5], and LongCat-Image [6], has actively explored this direction to elevate generative performance through unified understanding. These advancements underscore the transformative impact of unified models in redefining the boundaries of visual generation. Despite this rapid progress, current high-performing unified models remain prohibitively expensive. Models such as Qwen-Image (27B), HunyuanImage 3.0 (80B), BAGEL (14B), and Emu3.5 (34B) all demand billions of training samples and massive computational resources. Many further require separate generation and editing models, doubling the total parameter count, e.g., pushing deployment footprints to total of 54B for Qwen-Image & Qwen-Image-Edit and 26B for LongCat-Image & LongCat-Image-Edit. While the need for lightweight alternatives is clear, existing small-scale unified models [7, 8, 9] have consistently underperformed across diverse tasks, thereby reinforcing common perception: compact models lack the capacity for comprehensive multimodal generation and editing. Interestingly, closer examination of recent benchmarks challenges this view: performance does not scale monotonically with model size. For example, as shown in Fig. 2, Lumina-DiMOO (8B) achieves generation score of 86.04 on DPG-Bench, surpassing the larger BAGEL (14B, 85.10). Similar patterns are observed across other benchmarks and evaluation dimensions (Table 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). This indicates that, for unified multimodal models, larger scale alone does not necessarily guarantee stronger performance. Motivated by this observation, we argue that lightweight model, when empowered by synergistic architecture design and data-centric training strategies, can achieve comprehensive capabilities competitive with or even surpassing 2 Figure 2 Model performance comparison on image generation and editing benchmarks. Bubble size is proportional to model parameter count. Dashed outer rings indicate models with unreported parameter counts. Higher scores correspond to better performance. much larger counterparts. To substantiate this, we present DeepGen 1.0, compact framework with total of 5B parameters (3B VLM and 2B DiT) that integrates general generation, reasoning generation, text rendering, general editing, and reasoning editing within single model. Despite its compact size, DeepGen 1.0 achieves results competitive with or exceeding models 3 to 16 its size, as highlighted in Fig. 2. For instance, in general instruction following DPG-Bench, DeepGen 1.0 attains 87.90, eclipsing massive baselines like HunyuanImage 3.0 (86.10). Moving to reasoning-intensive tasks, it achieves 0.73 on WISE, outperforming the 80B HunyuanImage 3.0 (0.57) by remarkable 28% margin. Furthermore, on the editing front, it dominates the UniREditBench with 77.5, surpassing the dedicated 27B Qwen-Image-Edit (56.5) by over 37%. Across the board, DeepGen 1.0 demonstrates that intelligent design can triumph over raw scale. Remarkably, the entire training requires only 50M samples across simple three-stage pipeline, compared to 1.2B samples for LongCat-Image and 5B for HunyuanImage 3.0. To support these comprehensive capabilities within compact 5B budget, we introduce specialized architecture that maximizes VLM-DiT synergy. DeepGen 1.0 employs 3B VLM [10] as the understanding and reasoning backbone and 2B DiT [11] as the generative backbone. To align these two modules, we propose Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB). SCB first extracts hidden states from six uniformly distributed VLM layers (spanning low, mid, and high levels) to capture hierarchical features from visual and text inputs. To further enhance reasoning, we inject learnable think tokens that act as an implicit chain of thoughts. These multi-source features are then channel-wise concatenated and fused via lightweight connector into dense multimodal conditional sequence. Unlike prior methods that rely on the final VLM layer [5, 12] or use average pooling [13] that blurs fine-grained details, this design fully preserves both fine-grained visual details and high-level semantics, while providing the DiT with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. To fully unlock the potential of of DeepGen 1.0s compact architecture, we design data-centric training strategy tailored for tight VLM-DiT integration in the low-parameter regime. This strategy emphasizes simplicity and data efficiency across three progressively stages. First, in Alignment Pre-training, we optimize only the connector and learnable think tokens to align VLM representations with the DiTs latent space, utilizing large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets. Second, during Joint Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), we unfreeze the DiT and apply LoRA to the VLM for end-to-end optimization. We curate high-quality data mixture by integrating general generation and editing data, reasoning-based generation and editing data, and text-rendering data to foster omni-capabilities while preserving the VLMs inherent knowledge. Finally, 3 Figure 3 Overview of DeepGen 1.0 architecture. DeepGen 1.0 adopts unified VLM-DiT paradigm with dual-branch visual encoding strategy: ViT encoder captures high-level semantics for the VLM, while VAE encoder extracts compressed latent features for the DiT. Multimodal conditions derived from the VLM, together with reference-image VAE latents, are concatenated with the target images noise tokens to form single DiT input sequence, enabling self-attention over both conditioning and generation signals. Stacked channel bridging (SCB) performs deep feature fusion between the VLM and DiT to strengthen generation and editing, while DiT positional encodings explicitly distinguish reference tokens from target tokens. Icons shown at the right of each block indicate whether the corresponding module is frozen or trainable during the Pre-Training, SFT, and RL stages, respectively. we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to further align the model with human preferences. We adopt our novel MR-GRPO, with mixture of rewards and supervision signals, enhancing it with decoupled advantage normalization [14] to better preserve multi-reward granularity. To prevent capability degradation during RL, we introduce an auxiliary supervised diffusion loss, ensuring the model retains the broad capabilities acquired during the joint supervised fine-tuning stage. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We present DeepGen 1.0, compact 5B unified model that integrates general generation, reasoning, text rendering, and editing within single framework. Despite its small size, it achieves performance competitive with or surpassing models up to 16 larger (e.g., 80B), demonstrating that massive scaling is not the sole path to high-performance multimodal generation. We propose Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), lightweight alignment module that fuses multi-layer VLM features via channel concatenation and shallow connector. Augmented with learnable think tokens, SCB enables deep semantic transfer from the VLM to the DiT while preserving fine-grained visual details, offering superior alternative to standard final-layer or average-pooling approaches. We design data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) alignment pre-training on large-scale pairs and triplets, (2) joint SFT on high-quality mixture of generation, reasoning, editing, and text rendering tasks, and (3) we propose MR-GRPO for RL alignment with auxiliary supervision and mixture of rewards , enabling stable preference optimization without capability degradation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating leading performance among open-source models in reasoning-based generation and editing, while maintaining competitive general generation quality. 4 Figure 4 Overview of our training data for broad omni-capabilities and comprehensive evaluation across benchmarks. We publicly release the DeepGen 1.0 framework, including model weights, training and evaluation code, and key data components. By providing an efficient and high-performance alternative to resourceintensive large models, we aim to democratize unified multimodal research and empower broader community exploration."

            "content": "DeepGen 1.0 follows VLM-DiT architecture as shown in Fig 3, where the VLM offers strong multimodal understanding with well cross-modal alignment and rich world knowledge to capture complex multimodal priors from both textual and visual inputs. The DiT serves as high-fidelity generation decoder guided by multimodal conditional inputs extracted from the VLM. We utilize Qwen-2.5-VL (3B) [10] as our pretrained VLM and SD3.5-Medium (2B) as our DiT, initialized from [11] with joint generation and editing capability. Feature alignment is achieved via streamlined connector module, which instantiates SigLIP visual encoder [15] followed by six transformer layers [16]. This compact design maintains total model size of approximately 5B parameters, striking an optimal balance between performance and computational efficiency. Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB) Prior unified multimodal models [5, 6, 12, 17] typically take the final-layer (or penultimate-layer) hidden states of VLM, transform them through connector, and use them as multimodal conditional input to the DiT. This design has two key limitations. First, the final VLM layers are heavily biased toward high-level semantic abstraction, often discarding fine-grained visual details that are critical for DiT modeling [18]. Second, relying on single layer makes the conditional signal vulnerable to layer-specific representation biases, which can hinder stable alignment and effective fusion between the VLM and DiT. An alternative line of work [3, 19, 20] performs deep fusion by introducing shared attention between the VLM and DiT at every layer. However, this approach substantially increases parameter scale and optimization complexity, making efficient and reliable training challenging. Subsequent works [13] aggregate hidden states from multiple VLM layers using average pooling. To more effectively and efficiently aggregate features from multiple VLM layers while preserving fine-grained information and enhancing reasoning, we propose the Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB) framework. SCB operates through three integrated steps: - Think Token Injection. While standard VLM representations provide rich interleaved multimodal signals [7, 21], explicit reasoning tokens can further act as implicit Chains of Thought (CoT). To strengthen the models reasoning capability, we first inject fixed set of learnable think tokens into the VLM input sequence. These tokens interact with textual and visual inputs across all layers via self-attention, progressively summarizing hidden representations and effectively extracting knowledge encoded in the VLM. 5 Table 1 Comparison of different models across general image generation and editing benchmarks.

With the think tokens injected, we select multiple VLM hidden states to fuse, balancing performance and computational efficiency. Instead of relying on single layer, and following [22] which suggests that sparsely and uniformly distributed layers within VLMs provide effective representations for visual information, we select six hidden states sampled uniformly across the low-, mid-, and high-level layers. This ensures the capture of varying-granularity visual features and semantics, alongside the reasoning information embedded in the think token positions. - Feature Fusion. Finally, we integrate the selected multi-layer hidden states, which now encode both multimodal features and think token representations. Given set of selected VLM hidden states [𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛] ℝ𝐿𝑑 where 𝑛 denotes the number of selected layers and 𝐿 is the sequence length (including think tokens), we first stack them along the channel dimension. This concatenated feature tensor in dimension 𝑑 is then projected to match the DiT input width using lightweight two-layer MLP. The aligned features are then fed into Transformer-encoder-based connector to deeply fuse information across layers, producing the final robust conditional input 𝑐 ℝ𝐿𝑑DiT: 𝑐 = Encoder(MLP(Concatch(𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛))).

We attribute this to the fact that KL regularization only penalizes divergence from the reference policy without providing positive guidance toward high-quality generation. To this end, we introduce an auxiliary supervised diffusion loss ℒSFT computed on our high-quality SFT dataset, which continuously anchors the model to its supervised fine-tuning distribution. The overall training objective is: ℒtotal = (1 𝜆) ℒGRPO + 𝜆 ℒSFT, (5) where ℒSFT is the standard flow matching loss and 𝜆 is small mixing coefficient. This formulation allows the model to optimize for reward signals via GRPO while retaining the generation capabilities acquired during supervised fine-tuning."

Results across benchmarks are shown in Table 6. Effect of SCB. Removing Stacked Channel Bridging (w/o SCB) consistently degrades performance across all benchmarks: DPGBench drops from 87.05 to 85.55, GEdit from 7.12 to 6.75, WISE from 0.72 to 0.70, and RISE from 13.3 to 12.6. This verifies that SCB effectively aggregates multiple-layer VLM features and mitigates information loss compared to single-layer conditioning, thereby providing higher-quality multimodal signals to the DiT for both generation and editing. Effect of Think Tokens. Removing the learnable think tokens (w/o Think Tokens) leads to the most pronounced regression on reasoning-intensive benchmarks: WISE decreases from 0.72 to 0.68 and RISE from 13.3 to 11.7. This suggests that think tokens serve as an implicit reasoning buffer that distills knowledge 12 Figure 6 Evaluation curves during training for ablation variants on UniGenBench.

            "content": "To validate the contribution of each setting in our MR-GRPO framework, we conduct ablation studies by removing: (1) the auxiliary SFT loss, (2) the KL divergence regularization, and (3) the reward-wise advantage normalization. All variants are trained for 1,000 steps under identical configurations and evaluated on UniGenBench. Effect of Auxiliary SFT Loss. The auxiliary SFT loss is critical for maintaining generation quality during extended RL training. As shown in Figure 6(a), removing this loss leads to performance degradation after approximately 300 steps, eventually dropping well below the initial checkpoint by the end of training. Figure 6(b) further shows that text rendering improvement is also slower and more erratic without the SFT loss, lagging behind the baseline throughout most of training. This indicates that KL regularization alone is insufficient to anchor the model to its supervised fine-tuning distribution, and the SFT loss provides essential positive guidance that prevents capability drift and stabilizes learning across all objectives. Effect of KL Regularization. Removing KL regularization leads to lower UniGenBench overall score (75.07 vs. 75.69) and noticeable drop on DPGBench (87.32 vs. 87.75), as shown in Table 7. Figure 6(a) further reveals that the w/o KL variant lags behind the baseline throughout training, indicating that unconstrained policy updates can lead to forgetting of capabilities acquired during supervised fine-tuning. The combination of KL regularization and auxiliary SFT loss provides complementary constraints: KL penalizes divergence from the reference policy, while SFT loss provides positive guidance toward high-quality generation. Effect of Reward-wise Normalization. Normalizing advantages independently for each reward before aggregation stabilizes multi-reward optimization. As shown in Figure 6(a), replacing reward-wise normalization with joint normalization across all rewards yields comparable performance in the early stages but leads to growing gap after approximately 600 steps, with the final performance falling notably short of the baseline. Table 7 further shows significant drop in text generation score (32.18 vs. 35.06), suggesting that high-variance rewards can dominate the policy updates and impede progress on specific objectives when normalization is not applied per reward. 13 Table 7 Ablation study of RL training settings.

By synergizing deep VLM-DiT alignment architecture with progressive, data-centric training strategy, we demonstrate that comprehensive omni-capabilities, spanning generation, reasoning, and editing, can be achieved without relying on massive parameter scaling or excessive computational resources. Extensive evaluations highlight that DeepGen 1.0 not only outperforms existing open-source models of similar size but also rivals substantially larger systems (e.g., 80B parameters), particularly in reasoning-intensive and instruction-following tasks. Beyond technical contributions, DeepGen 1.0 offers broader implications for sustainable AI. By decoupling high-quality generation from massive computational resources, it paves the way for accessible research on consumer-grade hardware. By open-sourcing DeepGen 1.0, we hope it serves as foundational step toward democratizing unified multimodal intelligence and inspiring new efficient architectures."

            "content": "Noise-Preserving Stochastic Sampling. When sampling trajectories, the deterministic flow-matching ODE 𝑑𝑥𝑡 = ˆ𝑣𝜃(𝑥𝑡 , 𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 is unsuitable for the exploration required by reinforcement learning. Prior works [65, 66] convert it into stochastic differential equation (SDE) to introduce randomness. However, the standard Flow-SDE formulation injects noise that exceeds the schedulers expected noise level at each timestep, degrading sample quality and producing inaccurate reward signals. We instead adopt noise-preserving 19 stochastic sampling strategy [29] that ensures the noise level remains consistent with the flow matching scheduler at every timestep: 𝑥𝑡Δ𝑡 = (cid:0)1 (𝑡 Δ𝑡)(cid:1) ˆ𝑥0 + (𝑡 Δ𝑡) cos(cid:0) 𝜂𝜋 2 (cid:1) ˆ𝑥1 + (𝑡 Δ𝑡) sin(cid:0) 𝜂𝜋 (cid:1) 𝜖, (6) where ˆ𝑥0 = 𝑥𝑡 𝑡 ˆ𝑣𝜃 and ˆ𝑥1 = 𝑥𝑡 + (1𝑡) ˆ𝑣𝜃 are the predicted clean sample and noise respectively, 𝜖 𝒩 (0, 𝐼) is freshly sampled Gaussian noise, and 𝜂 [0, 1] controls the stochasticity strength. The log-probability for computing importance ratios is simplified as [29]: log 𝑝𝜃(𝑥𝑡Δ𝑡 𝑥𝑡) = 𝑥𝑡Δ𝑡 𝜇𝜃(𝑥𝑡 , 𝑡)2, (7) where 𝜇𝜃(𝑥𝑡 , 𝑡) = (1(𝑡 Δ𝑡)) ˆ𝑥0 + (𝑡 Δ𝑡) cos(cid:0) 𝜂𝜋 (cid:1) ˆ𝑥1 is the deterministic component of the sampling step. 2 This formulation removes the variance normalization term present in the standard log-probability, avoiding numerical instability at small noise levels. Reward Functions. We employ three reward functions to provide complementary training signals. (1) VLM-based pairwise preference reward [27] that evaluates image-text alignment and visual quality by comparing all generated images within each group and computing per-sample win rates as reward scores. (2) An OCR reward [67] that measures text rendering accuracy by detecting rendered text in the generated image and comparing it against the target text specified in the prompt. (3) CLIP similarity score [68] that captures overall semantic consistency between the generated image and the text condition. Each prompt category is assigned different reward composition: text-rendering prompts are weighted toward the OCR reward, while general text-to-image prompts prioritize the preference reward. The detailed reward weights are provided in Table 11. Training Details. The RL training prompts are drawn from two categories: general text-to-image prompts and text-rendering prompts. The auxiliary SFT data is sampled from an independent curated corpus of high-quality image-text pairs covering both general generation and text rendering. Dataset details are provided below. We train with group size of 𝐺 = 8, generating images at 512 512 resolution using 50 denoising steps. The model is optimized with learning rate of 2 106 for 1,500 steps. The complete set of hyperparameters is listed in Table 10. Hyperparameters. Table 10 summarizes the full set of hyperparameters used for RL training. Table 10 Hyperparameters for reinforcement learning training. Hyperparameter Value Group size 𝐺 Image resolution Denoising steps SDE stochasticity 𝜂 Timestep fraction Learning rate Total training steps KL coefficient 𝛽 Clip range 𝜖 SFT auxiliary coefficient 𝜆 SFT auxiliary frequency Global batch size DeepSpeed stage Precision 8 512 512 50 1.0 0.6 2 106 1,500 5 107 1 104 1 104 Every step 256 ZeRO-2 BF16 Reward Weights. Table 11 shows the per-category reward weight configuration. Text-rendering prompts are weighted toward the OCR reward to directly optimize text accuracy, while general text-to-image prompts rely primarily on the VLM-based preference reward for holistic quality assessment. 20 Table 11 Reward weight configuration by prompt category. Prompt Category Preference CLIP Sim OCR Text rendering General T2I 0.2 0.7 0.1 0.3 0.7 RL Training Prompts. The RL training prompts consist of two categories with proportional sampling. Text-rendering prompts (sample weight 3.0) are drawn from UniGenBench text data, Qwen-Image text rendering captions, and curated text rendering prompts. General text-to-image prompts (sample weight 1.0) are sourced from UniGenBench general data, BLIP3-o captions, ShareGPT-4o image descriptions, and CoREBench prompts. Auxiliary SFT Data. The auxiliary supervised data for computing ℒSFT is drawn from an independent corpus of high-quality image-text pairs. This corpus includes general text-to-image pairs (from BLIP3-o, ShareGPT-4o, Echo-4o, OpenGPT-4o, GenEval, and Self-Banana-50K collections) with sample weight 1.0, and text rendering pairs with sample weight 3.0 to match the emphasis on text rendering in the RL prompts."
