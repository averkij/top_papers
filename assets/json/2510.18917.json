            "title": "1 Introduction",
            "content": "Reverberation shapes both how people hear and how machine learning systems behave. Data for controlled studies are often hard to assemble at scale. Measured corpora can be small or lack detailed metadata, while simulated corpora sometimes have unclear provenance or inconvenient file layouts. Researchers spend time on path handling, schema drift, and brittle scripts rather than the questions they want to study. RIR-Mega was designed to lower these barriers. The dataset uses single compact CSV or Parquet file to describe each audio file. Paths are consistent. Acoustic metrics appear as JSON or dict like string and are also available as flat columns for fast filters. We provide loader that integrates with datasets.Audio, validation script for the metadata, and an optional checksum tool. The release includes simple baseline for RT60 regression so users can sanity check their pipeline in minutes. Figure 1 shows the simple flow: room specification, simulation, metadata, loader, and benchmarks. Contributions. (i) large set of simulated RIRs with broad coverage of room geometry and band limited decay. (ii) compact schema that is easy to parse and extend. (iii) Practical tools for validation and checksums. (iv) working baseline for RT60 like regression with clear numbers. (v) distribution plan that balances fast streaming on Hugging Face with long term archival on Zenodo. Availability.

The intent is to show that the simulated responses in RIR-Mega span similar RT60 and DRR ranges to those seen in real rooms, thereby confirming acoustic realism. To illustrate the format of this comparison, Figure 3 shows placeholder example that compares the distributions of RT60 and DRR between two internal subsets of RIR-Mega (linear and circular arrays). The goal is to demonstrate how measured versus simulated analysis will appear in the final release. 4 Figure 2: Validation summary. Top row shows RT60 histogram, DRR in dB, and room volume. Middle row shows distributions for Lx, Ly, and Lz. Bottom row shows Lx by Ly colored by Lz, waveform example, and Schroeder energy decay curve with an RT60 estimate."

The full 50k archive is available on Zenodo for complete experiments. Reproducibility. We include metadata validator and checksum script. The dataset card documents the exact release tag and how to verify files. The baseline script creates validation fold from training if none is present. Licensing. All audio and metadata are released under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. The dataset card lists terms and any future updates per subset if needed. Limitations. All examples in this release are simulated shoebox rooms. While this provides control and coverage, real spaces can deviate due to non ideal surfaces and complex geometries. We encourage users to test methods on measured data when possible. 5 Figure 3: Example comparison of RT60 and DRR distributions between two simulated subsets of RIR-Mega (linear and circular arrays). In the next release, this plot will be replaced with comparison against measured RIRs from public datasets such as the ACE Challenge or OpenAIR to verify the acoustic realism of the simulated data."

            "content": "Intended use. RIR-Mega is designed for dereverberation, room acoustics estimation, robustness studies, and related research. Limitations. While RIR-Mega aims for scale and clarity, selection biases can remain (e.g., room geometry distributions, material presets, microphone arrays). The compact schema preserves free-form fields to maximize flexibility; users may still need to parse nested strings for specialized tasks. Risks. Synthetic RIRs may not reflect all real-world complexities; conclusions drawn from purely simulated soundfields should be validated on measured data where feasible."
