Introduction Image and text embeddings power wide range of use cases, from search engines to recommendation systems [32, 43, 115]. However, evaluation protocols for image and multimodal embedding models vary widely, ranging from image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification [84, 116], linear probing [80, 84], fine-tuning the models [12, 38], and using MLLM performance as proxies [95]. These divergent protocols reveal the lack of standardized criteria for assessing image representations. We introduce the Massive Image Embedding Benchmark (MIEB) to provide unified comprehensive evaluation protocol to spur the fields advancement toward universal image-text embedding models. We build on the standard for the evaluation of text embeddings, MTEB [73], extending its codebase and leaderboard for image and image-text embedding models. MIEB spans 130 tasks grouped into 8 task categories: Aligning with MTEB, we integrate Clustering, Classification, and Retrieval. Notably, we consider fine-grained aspects, such as interleaved retrieval, multilingual retrieval, instruction-aware retrieval. We additionally include Compositionality Evaluation and Vision Centric Question Answering, respectively assessing nuanced information encoded in embeddings and their capabilities in solving vision-centric QA tasks. We focus on tasks that require strong visual understanding of texts, for which we include Visual STS, the visual counterpart of semantic textual similarity in NLP, and Document Understanding, assessing the vision-only understanding of high-resolution documents with dense texts and complex layout, enabling evaluation that pushes forward the development of natural interleaved embeddings. Our analysis across task categories shows that the performance of current image embedding models is fragmented, with no method dominating all task categories. We further study the predictability of the performance of visual encoders as part of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), via large-scale correlation study. We find that the performance of vision encoders on MIEB strongly correlates with the performance of MLLMs that use the same vision encoder. For instance, the performance on our Visual STS tasks has over 99% correlation with the performance of Figure 1. Overview of MIEB task categories with examples. See Table 1 for details about capabilities measured and other information. an MLLM leveraging the same vision encoder on tasks like OCRBench and TextVQA. This provides practical way to select vision encoders for MLLMs based on MIEB results. 2. The MIEB Benchmark 2.1. Overview [98]) with fine-grained domains (e.g., Existing image benchmarks are often task-specific (e.g., retrieval landmarks [100], artworks [112]). MIEB provides unified framework to evaluate diverse abilities of embedding models. We categorize tasks based on combination of the evaluation protocol (e.g., Clustering) and the abilities assessed (e.g., Document Understanding) to better align with user interests. Figure 1 and Table 1 summarize MIEB task categories. Beyond traditional tasks like linear probing, zeroshot classification, and image-text retrieval, we emphasize under-explored capabilities in image-text embedding models via: 1) Visual representation of texts, covered by document understanding and visual STS; 2) Vision-centric abilities, including spatial and depth relationships; 3) Compositionality; 4) Interleaved embedding; 5) Multilinguality. In addition to MIEB (130 tasks), we introduce MIEBlite, lightweight version of MIEB with 51 tasks to support efficient evaluation, by selecting representative tasks from task performance clusters, detailed in 6.3. We refer to for all datasets, statistics, and evaluation metrics for MIEB and MIEB-lite, and 4 for implementation details. Here, we discuss task categories and capabilities assessed. Retrieval Retrieval evaluates if embeddings of two similar items (images or texts) have high similarity [20]. We focus on three retrieval aspects: 1) Modality: The combination of images and texts among queries and documents and whether they are interleaved; 2) Multilinguality: Whether tasks cover mulitple languages, including texts in images; 3) Instructions Some tasks may benefit from instructions on what to retrieve, e.g., in VQA tasks questions in the text serve as example-specific instructions. We use nDCG@10 as the primary metric [92, 98], and recall@1/map@5 for some tasks to align with prior work or adjust for difficulty. Document understanding There has been much interest in using image embeddings to understand entire documents with interleaved figures and tables [27]. To address these needs, we create separate document understanding category. It uses the same evaluation procedure as retrieval and nDCG@5 as the main metric. Linear probing For linear probing, linear model is trained on embedded images to predict associated class labels [4, 84]. Linear probing allows evaluating knowledge encoded in embeddings, even if they are not spatially consistent as would be needed for good clustering performance. We opt for few-shot linear probing [16, 73] with default of 16 shots per class on which we train logistic regression classifier with maximum of 100 iterations. This method is more efficient than probing on the entire dataset [13, 80, 84], making it suitable for large-scale benchmarks like ours.

An overview of MIEB tasks. In brackets behind task categories, we denote the task type implementation in the code, e.g., our document understanding tasks use our retrieval implementation. We denote the modalities involved in both sides of the evaluation (e.g., queries and documents in retrieval; images and labels in zero-shot classification) with i=image, t=text. trend of k-shot per class, showing that model ranking generally remains the same across different values of k. In text embeddings, this task is often called classification [73], so we adopt that term in our code."

            "content": "Zero-shot Classification While generally using the same tasks as linear probing (e.g., [21]), zeroshot Classification directly matches image embeddings to classes without training separate classifier. We follow common practice and turn class labels into text prompts (e.g., for our ImageNet task, text prompt could be photo of space shuttle). This task is related to retrieval, specifically, setting where we only care about the top-1 match. We measure accuracy following prior work [84]. Models trained with non-representation losses, such as autoregressive models, often lack good off-the-shelf zero-shot performance, but may still perform well in linear probing [85]. Compositionality Evaluation Vision-language compositionality assesses whether the composition of given set of elements aligns with an image and text, such as relationships between objects, attributes, and spatial configurations. Commonly, it involves distinguishing ground truth from hard negatives with perturbed inputs, e.g., word order shuffling in ARO benchmark [114]. In our code implementation, we also refer to it as ImageTextPairClassification, as images and texts come in small pairs. The main metric we use for this task category is accuracy. Vision-centric question answering Inspired by insights from MLLMs [95], we include vision centric question answering tasks, including object counting, spatial relationships, etc. We also include other challenging visual perception tasks, such as perceiving art styles. This task category can be seen as form of retrieval where the corpus is small set of query-specific options (see Figure 1), thus it uses our retrieval code implementation. Clustering We use k-means clustering (with set to the number of true labels) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) [19, 89] as the main metric to evaluate if image embeddings group meaningfully in the embedding space according to the labels. Visual STS Semantic textual similarity (STS) is an established task to evaluate text embeddings [3, 9]. It measures the similarity of text embeddings compared to human annotations via Spearman correlation. In MIEB, we conceptualize Visual STS [105] as an out-of-distribution task to assess how good vision encoders are at understanding relative semantics of texts. We implement it by rendering STS tasks into images to be embedded by models. We compute embedding similarity scores and compare with human annotations at the dataset level using Spearman correlation as the primary metric, following practices for STS evaluation [73]. Leveraging this novel protocol, we reveal optical character recognition (OCR) of models like CLIP, which have largely gone unnoticed. 2.2. Design Considerations zero-shot Generalization We evaluation emphasize where models are not fine-tuned for specific tasks; only their embeddings are used. special case is linear probing, where frozen embeddings are used to train linear model. However, as the embedded information is not modified, we still consider it zero-shot. Usability In line with MTEB [73], we prioritize: 1) Simplicity: New models can be added and benchmarked in less than 5 lines of code by using our existing implementations or defining new model wrapper that can produce image embeddings and text embeddings with the model checkpoint; 2) Extensibility: New dataset can be added via single file specifying the download location of dataset in the correct format, its name, and other metadata; 3) Reproducibility: The benchmark is fully reproducible by versioning at model and dataset level; 4) Diversity; MIEB covers 8 diverse task categories with many different individual tasks, assessing distinct abilities for comprehensive benchmarking and flexibility to explore specific capabilities. 3. Models We evaluate three main model categories on MIEB. Note that the categories may overlap. 3.1. Vision-only Models MOCO-v3 [13] builds upon MOCO-v1/2 with the ViT architecture and random patch projection technique to enhance training stability. DINO-v2 [80] scales selfsupervised learning to 142M images with similarity-based curation. Different from previous computer vision systems that are trained to predict fixed set of predetermined object categories (e.g., ImageNet models [51]), these models are also referred to as self-supervised models. 3.2. CLIP Models [84] CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) trains models simultaneously on text-image pairs. We evaluate many models across this line of research including CLIP, SigLIP [116], ALIGN [45], Jina-CLIP [52], DataComp-CLIP [31], Open-CLIP [16], and EvaCLIP [91]. These models are also sometimes referred to as language-supervised models [84, 95]. We also evaluate VISTA [118], which fuses ViT encoder [22] with pretrained language model followed by CLIP-style training. 3.3. MLLM-based models Embedding models increasingly leverage MLLMs. For open-source models, we benchmark E5-V [46] and VLM2Vec [47]. E5-V uses pre-trained MLLMs followed by text-only contrastive fine-tuning with prompts like summarize the above sentence with one word and last-token pooling [72, 76], showing surprising generalization to images and interleaved encodings. VLM2Vec trains MLLM backbones on paired image-text datasets. We also evaluate the Voyage API model [2]. Recent multi-modal API embedding models optimize not only for standard image search, but also for business search applications like figure and table understanding, making them strong candidates for tasks that require deep visual-text understanding in MIEB. 4. Implementation Details For interleaved inputs in retrieval and other task categories, we follow the original implementation of each model if it is capable of taking in mixed-modality inputs [118], e.g., MLLM-based embedding models [46, 47]. Else, we by default apply simple sum operation on text and image embeddings [98] to attain interleaved embeddings, e.g., for CLIP-style models [31, 84, 91, 116]. 5. Experimental Results Table 2 presents the overall results for the top 20 models on MIEB (130 tasks) and MIEB-lite (51 tasks). We find that there is no universal embedding model with the best performance on all task categories. MLLM-based models lead in overall performance on MIEB and MIEB-lite, most notably excelling in visual text understanding and multilingual tasks. However, they perform worse than CLIP-style models in linear probing and zero-shot classification, indicating loss of precision in image representations. MLLM-based models struggle particularly with fine-grained classification tasks, such as bird species identification (see B, Tables 16, 17). Conversely, CLIP-style models are strong in traditional tasks like linear probing, zero-shot classification, and retrieval. Scaling model size, batch size, and dataset quality improves performance in clustering, classification, and retrieval, but not universally. These models struggle on interleaved retrieval, visual text representations, and multilingual tasks unless specifically optimized (e.g., the multilingual variant of SigLIP). The strong performance of MLLM-based embedding models and insights from their training recipes highlight potential pathway for future universal embedding models. E5-V [46], LLaVA-based model [64], achieves state-ofthe-art open-source performance on document understanding, visual STS, multilingual retrieval, and compositionality, despite using small batch size of 768 for text-only lightweight contrastive finetuning. This suggests its generative pretraining already leads to strong multimodal representations. However, it performs poorly on linear probing and zero-shot classification. Focusing on such tasks in larger scale finetuning stage may lead to good universal performance."

We refer to the leaderboard for the latest version: https://hf.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard with fine-grained categories (e.g., dog breeds in ImageNetDog15 [21]), indicating their limitations in encoding nuanced image features. Figure 2 is UMAP visualization on ImageNet Dog15, where E5-V underperforms CLIP-style models, showing less separation between fine-grained labels. EVA-CLIP [91], DataComp-CLIP [31], and OpenCLIP checkpoints [16] dominate in most clustering tasks. Similar to patterns in classification shown in the next section, state-of-the-art MLLM-based models have poor performance distinguishing fine-grained classes. 5.3. Zero-shot Classification Similar to Retrieval and Clustering, Zero-shot Classification (Tables 18, 19) requires coherent image and text embedding subspaces, thus CLIP-style models still dominate. MLLMbased models like E5-V, Voyage, and VLM2Vec largely underperform in zero-shot classification tasks, most notably ones with fine-grained labels. While decoder-based generative models show inherent generalizability in embedding tasks [24, 46, 74, 90, 97, 106], it is likely still necessary to learn robust fine-grained nuances through contrasting multimodality finetuning paired with validated training recipes Model Name E5-V SigLIP VISTA (m3) VLM2Vec Open-CLIP EVA02-CLIP xFlickr&CO avg. var.

Columns are STS12-17 and STS-b. tasks as images (2), if model is perfect in optical character recognition (OCR), its Visual STS performance would match its STS performance. Table 4 shows that this is almost the case, with some room left for improving the text recognition capabilities of E5-V. Tong et al. [95] show that textually-supervised models like CLIP are inherently good visual text readers, while purely visually-supervised models are not. Our results support this finding: EVA-CLIP, DataComp-CLIP (OpenCLIP variants trained on DataComp [31]), SigLIP, and CLIP achieve strong performance with EVA-CLIP-bigE-14-plus achieving an average English performance of 71.99 in Table 12, whereas Dino-v2 and Moco-v3 perform near random (Spearman correlation of 12.98 and 14.31). 5.7. Document Understanding As shown in 5.6, E5-V has strong OCR performance. This translates to strong performance on our Document Understanding tasks  (Table 15)  , where it is the best opensource model (avg. nDCG@5 of 62.69 on 10 Vidore tasks). Voyage-multimodal-3 has better performance but is closedsource. OpenCLIP [16] and DataComp-CLIP [31] variants provide insights into the positive impact of scaling model sizes and datasets to document understanding capabilities. The performance of OpenCLIP scales from 36.26 for its 430M parameter model (Vit-L) to 40.41 for its 990M parameter model (ViT-H); both having seen the same number of training examples. Data quality also matters with DataCompCLIP achieving 38.64 with ViT-L trained on only 13B seen examples, while the above OpenCLIP models use 32B examples. Figure 2. UMAP Visualization of ImageNet Dog15. Each class corresponds to one dog breed. CLIP clusters are more distinct. like large batch sizes and diverse datasets [16, 31, 84, 91]. 5.4. Linear Probing Average performance on linear probing is generally the highest among all our task categories, signaling that it is closer to saturation. However, with relatively low overall average scores on MIEB, there is still significant room to improve on the benchmark. In 6.1, we investigate label granularity and ablate the number of shots in linear probing, validating the robustness of our design choice of 16-shot for few-shot linear probing (2). 5.5. Multilingual Retrieval Our multilingual retrieval tasks span 38 languages with 55 subtasks [8, 93]. We present the full results in Table 11 and summarize the key findings here in Table 3. E5-V [46] achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual retrieval, highlighting the inherent strong multilingual abilities of LLaVA-Next [63], which E5-V initializes from. E5-V was fine-tuned contrastively using LoRA [41], which only lightly modifies the underlying models, thus leaving most knowledge (such as about different languages) intact. The multilingual version of SigLIP [116], siglipbase-patch16-256-multilingual, attains the second best performance. VISTA [118] models also perform strongly despite their relatively small sizes, showing notable consistency across languages. This cross-lingual robustness likely stems from its frozen backbone text model BGE-M3, which was trained to produce high-quality multilingual textual embeddings [11, 108]. Overall, these findings highlight that strong text encoder trained across various languages is critical to good multilingual performance. 5.6. Visual STS For Visual STS (Tables 12, 13, 14), E5-V [46] achieves the best performance. This is likely because it was trained on the allNLI collection (SNLI [7] + MNLI [101]), which is commonly used to train text representation models for STS tasks [85]. As our Visual STS simply renders existing STS Figure 3. Linear probing performance across different shots k. We select representative models from our vision-only and CLIP categories (3). See 6.1 for details on fine-grained and coarse-grained tasks. 5.8. Compositionality Evaluation Together with Retrieval, Compositionality Evaluation is Especially, where models have the lowest scores. WinoGround [94] is extremely challenging  (Table 20)  due to its image and textual confounders. We hypothesize that future models that better incorporate reasoning capabilities and test-time scaling techniques [35, 44, 68, 75, 109] may achieve better results on compositionality tasks. 5.9. Vision-centric QA BLIP models [58, 59] surprisingly contribute to two of the top 5 models in vision-centric QA  (Table 10)  despite their absence for other task categories. This highlights that including images in the contrastive finetuning stage can be beneficial, opposite to their exclusion in Jiang et al. [46]. 6. Discussions 6.1. K-shot Linear Probing We opt for k-shot linear probing instead of full-dataset linear probing as the default setting in MIEB (2) to make the evaluation cheaper given the large size of the benchmark. In Figure 3, we ablate this design by training kshot classifiers with in {8,16,32,64,128,256}. We find that different values of preserve the same model rank on both fine-grained classification (Birdsnap, Caltech101, CIFAR100, Country211, FGVCAircraft, Food101, Imagenet1k, OxfordFlowers, OxfordPets, RESISC45, StanfordCars, SUN397, UCF101) and coarse-grained classification (CIFAR10, DTD, EuroSAT, FER2013, GTSRB, MNIST, PatchCamelyon, STL10) tasks. As result, we choose modest 16-shot evaluation by default. Figure 4. Correlations between performance on generative MLLM benchmarks from Tong et al. [95] (y-axis) and our Visual STS (x-axis). High correlation means that our Visual STS tasks can predict generative performance. 6.2. On the predictability of MLLM performance MLLM evaluation has been proposed as robust method to assess visual representations [95], where the performance of an MLLM provides information about the strength of its visual encoder. However, this evaluation paradigm is much more computationally intensive than benchmarking only the vision encoder, given the large sizes of MLLMs and the large hyperparameter search space (data size, LLM choice, instruction-tuning details, etc.). Thus, it remains impractical as general benchmarking method. We explore the opposite: Can MLLM performance be predicted from the vision encoder [110]? To do so, we calculate correlations between vision encoder performance on MIEB tasks and their MLLM counterparts across 16 benchmarks using results from Tong et al. [95]. Figure 4 shows these correlations using our Visual STS protocol as an example [105]. Given the common need for visual text interpretation in MLLM tasks, vision encoders performance on Visual STS has strong correlation with the performance of their MLLM counterparts. The pattern is most pronounced for the 4 OCR and Chart tasks in [95], and least pronounced for CV-bench 3D, which relies little on visual text understanding. This highlights the utility of MIEB for selecting MLLM vision encoders. 6.3. MIEB-lite: lightweight Benchmark Computationally efficient benchmarks are more usable [25]. While MIEB avoids training MLLMs, evaluating 130 tasks remains resource-intensive. While more comprehensive coverage allows for more nuanced analysis, many tasks have high correlations (e.g., Visual STS in Figure 4). To enable lightweight evaluation, we build MIEB-lite by iteratively removing redundant tasks while preserving task category coverage and inter-task correlation. We first compute pairwise task correlations using model performance, then iteratively remove tasks with average correlations above 0.5 (11 tasks) and 0.45 (32 tasks). Key patterns emerged: 1) Established tasks (e.g., CLIP benchmark linear probing [84]) had high redundancy, possibly due to dataset exposure in pretraining; 2) Easy OCR tasks correlated unexpectedly with non-OCR tasks, though Visual STS and VIDORE remained distinct; 3) Novel tasks (e.g., ARO benchmark, M-BEIR protocols) had low correlations. To capture nuanced task relationships, we cluster tasks via UMAP+HDBSCAN [70, 71] using correlation vectors, yielding 17 interpretable clusters (e.g., fine-grained zeroshot, language-centric, easy OCR, VQA, low resolution tasks, etc). The outlier cluster (-1 label) spanned all categories, serving as foundation for balanced selection. MIEB-lite has 51 tasks by combining the above two approaches and excluding large-scale tasks (e.g., EDIS and GLD-v2 take 60-80 GPU hours for 7B models). MIEBlite reduces computation while maintaining category balModel Name E5-V CLIP (base-patch32) # Params Runtime (NVIDIA H100 GPU hours) (M) 8360 151 MIEB MIEB-lite Reduction % 264.0 16. 46.4 4.5 82.4% 72.9% Table 5. MIEB vs. MIEB-lite runtime comparison. ance and diagnostic power: 1) Table 5 compares model runtime on MIEB and MIEB-lite showing reduction of 82.4% for E5-V, an 8B model. 2) We find that the overall average performance of 38 models on MIEB and MIEB-lite has Spearman correlation of 0.992 and Pearson correlation of 0.986. See Tables 6, 7, and 8 for all MIEB-lite tasks. 7. Related Work Benchmarks Prior efforts toward universal image embedding benchmarks focus on narrow scopes. The CLIP Benchmark [84] evaluates semantic similarity via classification and retrieval, while UnED [113] and M-BEIR [98] expand retrieval evaluation to multi-domain and mixedmodality settings. However, three critical gaps persist: (1) Limited task diversity: Existing benchmarks overlook tasks like multi-modal composition [114], social media understanding [48], and multilingual evaluation [8], restricting cross-domain insights. (2) Neglect visual text tasks: While understanding text in images is key to many MLLM use cases [27], benchmarks for OCR [66] and visual document retrieval remain sparse. (3) Under-explored instruction tuning: Though instruction-tuned embeddings show promise for generalization [60, 117], their evaluation beyond retrieval is limited. MIEB addresses these gaps via unified protocols spanning 130 tasks, consolidating prior benchmarks into holistic framework. Protocol limitations Prior work relies heavily on linear probing and retrieval [38, 84], which struggle to assess generalization to complex tasks. While fine-tuning [12] adapts embeddings to specific tasks, it incurs high computational costs and risks overfitting. MIEB evaluates frozen embeddings through broader suite of protocols including retrieval, linear probing, zero-shot classification, and novel additions like pair-wise classification and clustering, providing more flexible and comprehensive assessment. 8. Conclusion We introduce the Massive Image Embedding Benchmark (MIEB), which consists of 8 task categories with 130 individual tasks covering 38 languages. We benchmark 50 models on MIEB, providing baselines and insights for future research. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating vision embeddings beyond classification and retrieval, and their role in facilitating multimodal generative models."

Overall Results & First MIEB Leaderboard Based on the per-task category results, we provide an overall ranking in Table 22, aggregating all results. Note that we currently exclude all models that are not able to evaluate on all tasks in the overall table, including vision-only models like Dino-2 and Moco-v3 that are not able to test on image-text tasks, yielding 36 models in the first MIEB leaderboard. Note that for models that are not in the overall table, we refer readers to per task category tables for details. D. Models All models used in evaluations are listed in Table 23. This appendix provides detailed information on all tasks within MIEB, including size, language, metrics, and other relevant details. Note that we present the categories based on Abstask implementations here. We recommend refer to Table 1 for the taxonomy based on capabilities assessed. Table 6 shows all information related to retrieval tasks. Table 7 presents data related to clustering, standard image classification, zero-shot classification, and multi-label image classification tasks. Lastly, Table 8 covers information for visual STS, text-based multiple choice, and image-text pair classification tasks. B. Per Task Category Results B.1.
