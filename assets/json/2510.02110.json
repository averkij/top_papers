            "content": "Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation, the task of generating semantically and temporally aligned, highquality audio from videos, is an extensive research area driven not only by its fundamental multimodal alignment challenges but also by its wide range of real-world applications, such as film production, video content creation, and game development (Luo et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; Mei et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b;a; Viertola et al., 2025; Cheng et al., 2025; Zhong et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025). Recent advances have led to models capable of generating high-fidelity audio with strong audio-visual synchronization (Cheng et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025). However, the prevailing paradigm operates in an offline setting, assuming that an entire video sequence or chunks of frames are available in advance. This fundamentally limits their use in frame-level online applications. In addition to limiting online applications in live content creation, this offline constraint also becomes critical in the context of world models, which generate video sequences in an online manner from frame-level conditions (Schmidhuber, 1990; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Bruce et al., 2024; Baldassarre et al., 2025; Ball et al., 2025). Recent models, such as Genie 3 (Ball et al., 2025), can generate video frames in real-time (Ball et al., 2025; Microsoft, 2025; He et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a), yet they remain silent, operating solely in the pixel domain. Since audio and vision are tightly coupled in both real and simulated worlds, extending world models to the audio-visual domain could broaden their applicability to entertainment, education, and interactive world simulation for robotics (Chen et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2024b; NVIDIA et al., 2025), open-ended learning (Team, 2021), and agent training"

            "content": "Figure 1: Our scope is frame-level online video-to-audio (V2A) generation task, where future video frames are not available in advance. This contrasts with conventional offline V2A task, where an entire video sequence or chunk of frames is available in advance. (Chen et al., 2022a; Team, 2024). To bring sound to these worlds requires moving beyond the offline assumption toward new paradigm of frame-level conditioned online general audio generation. To address this, we introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where model autoregressively generates audio corresponding to video stream without accessing future frames (See Figure 1). The online setting imposes additional unique challenges beyond those inherent to the offline setting1: 1). End-to-end causality: The entire autoregressive (AR) framework, including the vision encoding, should be causal, as future video frames are inaccessible beforehand, 2). Low per-frame latency: models should generate audio at low per-frame latency for real-time interactive applications. Notably, even state-of-the-art V2A systems that use AR models (e.g., V-AURA (Viertola et al., 2025)) do not enforce end-to-end causality on their vision encoders (We refer to Section 4.2 and Appendix for more details.). To tackle these challenges, we introduce SoundReactor, the first simple yet effective framework tailored for the frame-level online V2A task on full-band stereo audio. Our design is driven by three essential properties: end-to-end causality, low per-frame latency, and high-quality audio generation with semantic and temporal audio-visual alignment. Our framework consists of an image encoder, waveform encoder, and causal, decoder-only multimodal Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) with diffusion head (Li et al., 2024) (See Figure 2). For the image encoder, we introduce novel conditioning scheme based on pretrained DINOv2 encoder (Oquab et al., 2024) (Figure 2 (a)). We extract spatial grid (patch) features from each frame, process that is inherently causal. The availability of its lightweight variants (e.g., 21M parameters) contributes to low per-frame latency for vision encoding. Moreover, we further augment these grid features with temporal differences, providing both semantic and temporal information to the generative model backbone. For continuous audio latents, we utilize Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) (Figure 2 (b)). We choose continuous latents for two reasons. First, for complex data such as full-band stereo audio, continuous representations tend to yield superior reconstruction quality over discrete counterparts at the same temporal downsampling rate (Lan et al., 2024), which is crucial for the final generation quality 2. Second, by representing each frame with single audio latent, it simplifies AR modeling compared to predicting multiple code indices per frame as typically required by residual vector quantization (RVQ)-based tokenizers (Kumar et al., 2023; DÃ©fossez et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025b). Finally, to reduce inference latency, we accelerate the diffusion head with Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) (Geng et al., 2025b). We demonstrate the efficacy of SoundReactor on the OGameData dataset (Che et al., 2025), largescale dataset of diverse AAA gameplay videos, motivated by the field of world models. Through our experiments, we show that our model generates semantically and temporally synchronized, high-quality, full-band stereo audio under the end-to-end causal constraint. This performance is validated by both objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves remarkably low per-frame waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1 and 31.5ms with NFE=4), measured on 480p, 30FPS videos using single H100 GPU. 1e.g., generating high-quality audio with strong semantic and temporal audio-visual alignment. 2While the reconstruction quality of discrete tokenizers can be improved by increasing their bitrate, training high-bitrate tokenizers is non-trivial task."

            "title": "2.1 DIFFUSION MODELS",
            "content": "Let pdata denote the data distribution. In Diffusion Models (DMs) (Ho et al., 2020), clean sample x0 pdata is generated through an iterative denoising process, beginning from Gaussian prior pT . When the forward diffusion process is defined by dxt = 2t dwt, initialized by x0, where wt is the standard Wiener process in forward-time (Karras et al., 2022; 2024), the deterministic counterpart of the denoising process, called the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) (Song et al., 2021), is formulated as dxt dt = log pt(xt). (1) Typically, DMs are trained by minimizing Denoising Score Matching (DSM) objective (Vincent, 2011; Song et al., 2021) expressed as: Ex0,t,Ïµ[x0 DÎ¸(xt, t)2 2], where Ïµ (0, I), xt = x0 + Ïµ, and DÎ¸(xt, t) is neural approximation of denoiser function Ep0t(x0xt)[x0xt] = xt + t2 log pt(xt) (Efron, 2011). (2) 2.2 AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELING WITHOUT DISCRETE TOKENIZATION AR V2A generation models have been typically implemented on discrete tokens (Iashin & Rahtu, 2021; Sheffer & Adi, 2023; Du et al., 2023; Mei et al., 2024b; Viertola et al., 2025) (A broader literature review of V2A generation models is provided in Appendix A.1.) In contrast, several recent works decouple discrete tokenization from AR modeling (Li et al., 2024; Tschannen et al., 2025b;a). Specifically, MAR (Li et al., 2024) models per-token conditional distributions via DM. Our framework builds on MAR, and we decode one token (here, continuous-valued latent3) at time in chronological order. We refer to this sampling variant as MAR throughout4. Below, we outline both sampling and training procedures of MAR. Let zi Rcz denote an output vector by an AR model FÏ at position i. Decoding in MAR proceeds in two stages. First, the conditioning vector zi is estimated by previous tokens: zi = FÏ(<BOS>, z1, . . . , zi1), where <BOS> is start token to generate z1. Second, vector x0 zi) via an iterative denoising procedure (e.g., Eq. 1) using trained conditional denoiser DÎ¸(xt i, t, zi). For training, the AR model FÏ and the diffusion head DÎ¸ are jointly trained by minimizing diffusion loss (Ho et al., 2020). In this work, we employ the following DSM objective based on EDM (Karras et al., 2022; 2024): is sampled from the probability q(x0 L(Î¸, Ï) = Ex0, t, Ïµ (cid:13) (cid:13)x0 DÎ¸(xt i, t, zi)(cid:13) 2 (cid:13) 2 . (3) (cid:34) (cid:88) (cid:35) 2.3 EASY CONSISTENCY TUNING i=1 Despite their success, DMs are slow at sampling, often requiring tens to hundreds of steps to generate single sample (Ho et al., 2020; Karras et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). This limitation is particularly severe for our frame-level online V2A setting, where the AR model with the diffusion head incurs 3Unless otherwise stated, we denote \"token\" as continuous-valued latent. 4The original MAR predicts tokens autoregressively with various protocols."

To address the slow generation of DMs, substantial community efforts have been made to reduce the number of sampling steps while preserving quality (Song et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024; Song & Dhariwal, 2024; Lu & Song, 2025; Geng et al., 2025b; Zhou et al., 2025; Geng et al., 2025a; Saito et al., 2025; Novack et al., 2025a;b). Within the family of Consistency Models (CMs) (Song et al., 2023; Song & Dhariwal, 2024; Lu & Song, 2025), ECT (Geng et al., 2025b) smoothly interpolates from DMs to CMs by progressively tightening the consistency condition, thereby bootstrapping pretrained DM into CM. It further shows that initializing CM with pretrained DM yields superior performance under smaller training budget. CMs are grounded in the PF-ODE (Eq. 1) and learn consistency function GÎ¸(xt, t) that maps noisy sample xt back to its clean data x0 as GÎ¸(xt, t) = x0. In ECT, GÎ¸(xt, t) is trained by minimizing the following objective: Ex0,t,r,Ïµ (cid:2)w(t)d(cid:0)GÎ¸(xt, t), Gsg(Î¸)(xr, r)(cid:1)(cid:3) , (4) where > > 0, xt = x0 + Ïµ, xr = x0 + Ïµ, w(t) is weighting function, sg(Î¸) indicates an exponential moving average (EMA) of the past values of Î¸, and is metric function.

            "content": "Model overview Figure 2 summarizes SoundReactor. Our framework has three components: (a) Video token modeling: pretrained vision encoder projects each raw RGB video frame Vi RHW 3 to single aggregated token vi; (b) Audio token modeling: VAE encodes full-band stereo waveforms into sequence of continuous-valued tokens xi; and (c) Multimodal AR transformer with diffusion head: frame-aligned, interleaved audiovisual tokens are fed into causal decoder-only transformer trained with next-token prediction by an EDM2-style DSM loss. Video token modeling Figure 2 (a) depicts our video token modeling. We adopt pretrained DINOv2 vision encoder (Oquab et al., 2024) to extract grid (patch) features ËVi RH cdinov2 per video frame. To inject temporal cues, each frames features are then concatenated with their temporal difference from the previous frame ( ËVi ËVi1) along the channel dimension. These features pass through projection layer with 2D convolutional downsampler and are then flattened. We then prepend learnable aggregation token and feed this sequence to shallow transformer aggregator, yielding single token vi per frame. We use grid features instead of the encoders [CLS]-token because, in our preliminary analysis, [CLS]-token lacked temporal cues needed for audio-visual synchronization (described in more detail in Appendix B.1). We choose DINOv2 for its availability of lightweight variant (21 parameters) for encoding efficiency and for its rich semantic representations (Ranzinger et al., 2024). Note that leveraging pretrained DINOv2 and its grid features from vision encoders as video conditioning for V2A generation remains underexplored. Audio token modeling Figure 2 (b) provides our audio token modeling. Following the VAEs from Stable Audio (SA) series (Evans et al., 2024; 2025), we compress stereo 48 kHz waveforms into sequence of audio tokens xi. Since the original SA-VAE is not trained at 48 kHz, we train it from scratch. Using continuous-valued tokens brings two benefits for AR audio generation. First, without discrete tokenization (Kumar et al., 2023; DÃ©fossez et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025b), reconstruction quality is typically higher at the same temporal downsampling rate (Lan et al., 2024). Second, AR modelings can be simplified because waveform VAEs represent each time frame with single latent, allowing AR models to sample one token per frame. In contrast, especially in the full-band general audio settings, discrete tokenizers commonly rely on RVQ, which typically requires AR models to predict multiple code indices per frame (Copet et al., 2023; DÃ©fossez et al., 2024). Multimodal transformer with diffusion head In Figure 2 (c), we present the framework of the multimodal causal decoder-only transformer with the diffusion head. We feed frame-aligned, interleaved audiovisual continuous-valued tokens into the model. The AR backbone follows LLaMAstyle design (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), applying pre-normalization using RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019), SwiGLU activation (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024). The diffusion head largely follows the original architecture in MAR. We follow the EDM2 (Karras et al., 2024) training framework for DSM loss; accordingly, we add simple one-layer MLP to parameterize an uncertainty function, which we describe in Section 3.3. To obtain conditional token zi, which is fed to the diffusion head, we first conduct channel-wise concatenation zi = Concat(z2i1, z2i), where z2i1 and z2i are the outputs of transformer depicted in Figure 2 (c). By following MAR, we then project zi to the heads channel dimension. 3.3 TRAINING FRAMEWORK Stage 1: Diffusion pretraining We first pretrain the model with next-token prediction by minimizing DSM objective under the EDM2 framework. The overall training loss is formulated as: LStage 1(Î¸, Ï) = Ex0,t,Ïµ Î»(t)euÎ¸ (t) (cid:34) (cid:88) i=1 (cid:13) (cid:13)x DÎ¸(xt i, t, zi)(cid:13) 2 2 + uÎ¸(t) (cid:13) (cid:35) , (6) <i), loss weighting Î»(t) = (t2 + Ï where zi = FÏ(vi, x0 data)/(t Ïdata)2, lnt (Pmean, Pstd), Ïdata is the standard deviation of the training data, and uÎ¸(t) is one-layer MLP-based continuous uncertainty function quantifying the uncertainty for the denoising objective at noise level (Karras et al., 2024). We provide the training algorithm of Stage 1 in Algorithm 1."

We initialize model weight with the Stage 1 model. During training, = is gradually annealed as 0 by following mapping function m(rt, Iters) along with the number of training iterations Iters. We use m(rt, Iters) formulated as: i, t, vi, x0 m(rt, Iters) = 1 (cid:18) 1 qIters/s (cid:19) kÏ(bt) t, (8) where Ï() is the sigmoid function, q, s, k, and are hyperparameters that control the annealing schedule. Note that we finetune both the transformer and the diffusion head on Stage 2 (See an ablation on this in Appendix C.1.). We provide the training algorithm of Stage 2 in Algorithm 2. 3.4 SAMPLING FRAMEWORK At inference time, following the MAR decoding paradigm, we operate two-stage procedure. First, we obtain zi by channel-wise concatenation Concat(z2i1, z2i), where z2i1 and z2i are outputs of the transformer. Second, the diffusion head samples x0 conditioned on zi through the reverse-diffusion sampling with the Stage 1 model or CM sampling with the Stage 2 model. 2i 2i znull is the transformer output given the visual condition vi, and znull 2i To get z2i (a corresponding input token is vision condition vi), we apply Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) (Ho & Salimans, 2022) on the transformers sampling as z2i = znull 2i ), where Ï is guidance scale, zcond is the output given learnable null embedding, respectively. To get znull 2i , all the vi are replaced with the learnable null embedding. To enable CFG sampling, we randomly replace all the video tokens vi(i = 1, . . . , n) by the null embedding during training. We use KV-cache (Shazeer, 2019) for efficient inference.

From the original 250,000 videos (14-16 seconds each), we collected 230K available samples and manually filtered out clips containing only background music. This results in training set of 94K samples (around 400 hours) and test set of 3, 830 samples. To ensure balanced representation of each game, we create the train and test splits by maintaining consistent clip ratio within each game title. All data is processed at 30 FPS with 480p resolution and 48 kHz stereo audio. During training, we randomly sample 8-second clips. Our primary evaluation is conducted on 8-second clips. We also test our models on longer sequence generation beyond the training context window on 16-second clips using zero-shot context-window extension techniques (Chen et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024). 4.2 COMPARING METHODS As discussed in the preceding sections, our scope is the frame-level online V2A task.

We retrain the transformer part. Crucially, although V-AURAs backbone is the AR transformer, its video encoder, Synchformer (Iashin et al., 2024), extracts chunk-level features using non-causal self-attention across frames (Bertasius et al., 2021; Patrick et al., 2021; Iashin et al., 2024) (i.e., Synchformer extracts chunks of video frames, and its video features contain future information), so it is not strictly compatible with the frame-level online V2A task5. SoundReactor We evaluate two main variants of our model: SoundReactor-Diffusion (after Stage 1) and SoundReactor-ECT (after Stage 2). We also employ the reconstruction from our VAE as reference. Unless otherwise specified, SoundReactor-Diffusion is sampled with 30-step deterministic Heun solver (Number of Function Evaluation (NFE)=59). We set Ï = 3.0 to get z2i (See Section 3.4). We investigate the influence of Ï in Appendix C.2. 4.3 EVALUATION METRICS Audio quality To evaluate audio quality, we use Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) (Gui et al., 2024), Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) (Jayasumana et al., 2024; Chung et al., 2025), and KullbackLeibler divergence based on PaSST (Koutini et al., 2022) (KLPaSST). For FAD and MMD, following prior work Evans et al. (2024; 2025); Gui et al. (2024), we use OpenL3 (Cramer et al., 2019) and LAION-CLAP (Wu* et al., 2023) as audio feature extractors. Since our model is trained on stereo signals, we compute the metrics on four channel configurations: the left channel (Left), the right channel (Right), their average (Center), and their difference (Diff) (Steinmetz et al., 2021). We compute KLPaSST only on the Center. Furthermore, as complementary metric to evaluate stereo quality, we also use Frechet Stereo Audio Distance (FSAD) (Sun et al., 2025), which is based on StereoCRW (Chen et al., 2022b) features. Audio-visual alignment To evaluate audio-visual semantic and temporal alignment, we utilize ImageBind score (IB-Score) (Girdhar et al., 2023) and DeSync (Viertola et al., 2025) by following common practices (Cheng et al., 2025; Viertola et al., 2025). To compute DeSync, we take two crops (first 4.8 sec. and last 4.8 sec.) from the video and compute the average over the results (Cheng et al., 2025). We compute these two metrics only on the Center. Listening test To complement our objective metrics, we conduct subjective listening test following the MUSHRA style (ITU-R BS.1534-3). We compare three methods: V-AURA, SoundReactor-ECT (NFE=1), and SoundReactor-ECT (NFE=4). From pool of 50 video clips, each of 17 human evaluators is presented with 10 randomly selected samples per method in addition to the ground truth as hidden reference. Participants are asked to rate the generated audio based on four criteria on 5We note that their work targets the offline V2A task."

FADCLAP MMDCLAP FADCLAP MMDCLAP Effectiveness on frame-level online V2A generation The results of the quantitative and subjective evaluations are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3. For these evaluations, V-AURAs monaural signal is duplicated for the left and right channels. Consequently, its Diff is omitted as the difference becomes zero. These tables show that our methods outperform V-AURA on all metrics except for DeSync, indicating the effectiveness of SoundReactor on the frame-level online V2A generation task. The results of FSAD in Table 2 and Stereo in Table 3 demonstrate that our model can generate stereo audio with panning accuracy with visual sound-event locations. We refer the generated audio samples to the demo page6. Comparing the performance of SoundReactor-Diffusion and ECTs in 1 to 3, the ECTs show comparable performance with the Diffusion even at NFE=1 on the head, and surpass it at NFE=4. While SoundReactor-Diffusion uses NFE=59, SoundReactor-ECTs require only 14 NFEs for the diffusion head, yielding 14.8 fewer NFEs at NFE=4 and 59 fewer at NFE=1, with small performance degradation. We measure per-frame latency in wall-clock time in later paragraph. As supplementary evaluation, we benchmark our framework against various offline V2A approaches on the VGGSound dataset (Chen et al., 2020b) in Appendix C.4. Long-seq. gen. Ours w/. SWA Ours w/.

Features are extracted from 8-sec. sliding windows with 1-sec. hop size. These features are then aggregated via mean-pooling to compute metrics. Generation beyond training context window We test our model on longer sequence generation beyond the training context window using zero-shot context-window extension techniques. Specifically, we use 16-second test set samples (1, 206 samples in total), which is twice the training context window. We apply and compare two common zero-shot RoPE scaling techniques to extend the context window: Position Interpolation (PI) (Chen et al., 2023) and NTK-aware interpolation (NTK) (Peng et al., 2024) (See Appendix B.4.) and Sliding Window Attention (SWA)7 (Beltagy et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2023). All the methods are applied on SoundReactor-ECT (NFE=4). Table 4 demonstrates that the NTK does not show significant performance degradation across either the first or last 8-second segment, despite extending the context window. In contrast, PI shows degradation throughout the entire sequence, while SWA degrades in the second half. This indicates that NTK-aware scaling effectively mitigates the distribution shift caused by long-sequence generation. In terms of overall quality, Table 5 shows that NTK and SWA are competitive, with Ours w/. SWA Ours w/. PI Ours w/.

CF and IN indicate different mapping functions (see Appendix B.2). 0.1 and 0.2 denote dropout rates (Srivastava et al., 2014) during finetuning. CF0.2 is our default. PI performing worst. These results demonstrate that, by leveraging the NTK, our model achieves zero-shot context-window extrapolation without having the distribution shift. Given that interactive multimodal applications might require minuteto hour-scale generation, we leave exploring longerhorizon generation as future work. From qualitative observation, the spectrogram visualization in Figure 3 shows that PI slows periodic sounds (e.g., footsteps) and harms temporal synchronization, while NTK and SWA preserve timing (See Appendix B.4 for further discussion). Table 6: Mean and standard deviation of per-frame latencies over 50 clips. Lower than 33.3ms on waveform-level latency is per-frame real-time operation. Per-frame latency measurement We measure two types of latency: waveform-level and token-level latency. Waveform-level latency is the elapsed time from feeding the previous audio token xi1 into the model until the output xi is incrementally decoded into waveform, including the encoding of raw video frame Vi. Token-level latency is identical to this but excludes the waveform decoding (Detailed in Appendix B.5). We perform this benchmark on single H100 GPU with batch size of one, using single CUDA stream. We provide the mean and standard deviation over the 50 clips (30FPS, 480p, 16 second) with the default our ECT at Ï = 3.

We use two representative choices from Geng et al. (2025b), denoted IN and CF (detailed in Appendix B.2). Under CF, we test dropout rates of 0.1 and 0.2 (CF0.2 is identical to our default ECT.). As shown in Figure 4, comparing CF0.1 and CF0.2 reveals that the dropout rate substantially impacts sample quality. This aligns with prior findings in Song & Dhariwal (2024); Geng et al. (2025b) and newly shows that tuning it remains significantly important even in MAR-style models. Comparing IN0.2 and CF0.2, both settings show comparable performance on NFE=2 and 4. Notably, however, only CF0.2 can generate high-quality samples with NFE=1. For deeper understanding of our model, we provide extensive ablations on various aspects of both the generator (in Appendix C.1 and C.2) and vision conditioning (in Appendix C.3), which demonstrate that our design choices contribute to the overall performance."

            "content": "A.1 VIDEO-TO-AUDIO GENERATION Offline video-to-audio (V2A) generation has been explored using both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (Non-AR) models. AR models. AR models for V2A have focused on generating discrete audio tokens. One line of work operates on VQ-VAE (van den Oord et al., 2017) latents derived from Mel-spectrograms, which requires separate vocoder for waveform synthesis. This category includes SpecVQGAN (Iashin & Rahtu, 2021), which uses transformer to generate code indices from video RGB and optical flow; Im2Wav (Sheffer & Adi, 2023), which adopts dual-transformer architecture conditioned on CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) features; and CondFoleyGen (Du et al., 2023), which uses ResNet (2+1)D-18 vision encoder (He et al., 2016). Another line of AR models utilizes discrete tokenizers based on raw waveforms using RVQ (DÃ©fossez et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). In this paradigm, FoleyGen (Mei et al., 2024b) explores various vision encoders like CLIP and ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023), while V-AURA (Viertola et al., 2025) has achieved state-of-the-art performance in this category by introducing Synchformer (Iashin et al., 2024) video encoder, which enabled semantic and strong temporal alignment. The Synchformers video encoder, Motionformer (Patrick et al., 2021; Bertasius et al., 2021) relies on non-causal attention over video chunks. While suitable for the offline task, this makes V-AURA incompatible with our scope, the frame-level online V2A task. Our framework, SoundReactor, is categorized in this AR paradigm based on continuous audio latents and is applicable for both the offline and frame-level online V2A tasks. Non-AR models. Non-AR models have also been widely investigated. The first direction involves training models from scratch based on Diffusion Models (DMs) (Ho et al., 2020) and Flow-matching Models (FMs) (Liu et al., 2023b). For instance, Diff-Foley (Luo et al., 2023) uses CAVP (Luo et al., 2023) vision encoder to train DMs on Mel-spectrogram latents, while MultiFoley (Chen et al., 2025) applies similar approach to latents derived from raw waveforms projected by DAC-based VAE (Kumar et al., 2023). Models such as Frieren (Wang et al., 2024b) and MMAudio (Cheng et al., 2025) leverage FMs; Frieren uses CAVP, whereas MMAudio employs multimodal diffusion transformer (Esser et al., 2024) with CLIP and Synchformer encoders. ThinkSound (Liu et al., 2025) builds upon multimodal LLM framework that uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning, followed by the MMAudio-style audio generator. second direction is training models from scratch based on discrete tokens using MaskGIT (Chang et al., 2022). VATT (Liu et al., 2024a) employs twostage pipeline where it first generates text caption from the video and then uses MaskGIT to predict code indices of EnCodec (DÃ©fossez et al., 2023). MaskVAT (Pascual et al., 2024) applies MaskGIT to predict code indices of DAC conditioned on CLIP and SparseSync (Iashin et al., 2022) features. The third major trend is an adaptation of pre-trained text-to-audio models. Several methods steer AudioLDM (Liu et al., 2023a): ReWaS (Jeong et al., 2024) uses ControlNet-based approach (Zhang et al., 2023) with an energy curve from the Synchformer; V2A-Mapper (Wang et al., 2024a) employs lightweight network to map CLIP embeddings to CLAP embeddings (Wu* et al., 2023); Seeing & Hearing (Xing et al., 2024) conditions the generator using ImageBind as multimodal aligner; and FoleyCrafter (Zhang et al., 2024) fine-tunes it using an adapter-based method with CLIP features and learnable timestamp adapter. Other backbones are also adapted, such as SpecMaskGIT (ComunitÃ  et al., 2024) by SpecMaskFoley (Zhong et al., 2025) and Stable Audio Open (Evans et al., 2025) by CAFA (Benita et al., 2025), both using ControlNet with CLIP and Synchformer features. A.2 AR AUDIO GENERATION WITHOUT VECTOR QUANTIZATION Our work builds upon the emerging paradigm of AR audio generation with continuous audio latents. Prior work in this area has focused on unimodal audio domains such as unconditional music generation (CAM (Pasini et al., 2024)) and speech synthesis (DiTAR (Jia et al., 2025), SALAD (Turetzky et al., 2024), MELLE (Meng et al., 2025)). Concurrently, CALM (Rouard et al., 2025) adopts MAR-style framework (Li et al., 2024) for speech and music continuation, using consistency model-based head. Our work is distinct from this prior and concurrent work in two key aspects. First, to our best knowledge, we are the first to tackle an audio-visual multimodal task within this paradigm, where"

We use grid features instead of the encoders [CLS]-token because it lacks the temporal cues necessary for audio-visual synchronization. Our preliminary analysis, shown in Figure 5, reveals that the cosine similarities between (A) adjacent video frames (30FPS) and (B) every other frame (15FPS) are significantly high8. We extract grid features from the final layer before the [CLS]-token head. We employ the dinov2-vits14-reg9 (21 parameters) for better per-frame encoding efficiency than larger backbones. Since raw grid features might be computationally expensive depending on budget (e.g., training throughput and data storage), we first apply bilinear interpolation to halve both spatial dimensions. Second, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2011) to reduce the hidden dimension from the original 384. We use 59, which preserves 70% of the cumulative explained variance (CEV) by default. These compressed features are precomputed before training. The adjacent frame subtraction is conducted on the precomputed grid features before being fed to the downstream projection layer described in Section 3.2 and Figure 2 (a).

We change the temporal downsampling rate from 2048 to 1600 and train with 48 kHz stereo waveform by using OGameData250K and WavCaps (Mei et al., 2024a) dataset from scratch. We follow the original training configuration (Evans et al., 2025). The network parameter size is 157 M. In the latent space, we get 64 dimensions of 30-Hz continuous audio latents. Multimodal transformer with diffusion head For the multimodal AR transformer, we use 18 layers, 1024 hidden dimensions, and 16 heads. The model backbone follows LLaMA-style design (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), applying pre-normalization using RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019), SwiGLU activation (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024). For the diffusion head, we set 8 blocks and width of 1280 channels. The architecture of the diffusion head largely follows the original architecture in MAR. The total parameter size is 320 (250 for the transformer and 70 for the diffusion head). We ablate various numbers of parameters of the diffusion head in Appendix C.1.

We set Pmean = 0.4, Pstd = 1.0 for training noise sampling ln (Pmean, Pstd) and network dropout rate of 10% (Srivastava et al., 2014). The models are trained using the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) for 300K training iterations. Training is done on 8NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Training duration is around 36 hrs. Training is done with bf16. The weight decay and momenta for AdamW are 0.02 and (0.9, 0.95). We set learning rate of 1e 4 with the constant learning rate scheduler, EMA rate of 0.9999, and gradient clipping as 1.0. By default, we use batch size of 128. To enable CFG sampling on the transformer, during training, we randomly replace all the video tokens vi(i = 1, . . . , n) with the learnable null embedding with the probability of 10%. As our denoising network is not so large, we can sample multiple times for any given zi. We sample by 4 times during training for each sample by following (Li et al., 2024). This operation helps improve the utilization of the loss function. Stage-2: ECT As same as Stage 1 network configuration, we utilize the EDMs skip connection cskip(t), output scale cout(t), input scale cin(t), and cnoise(t) for modeling the head.

B.3 SAMPLING DETAILS AR transformer Our sampling procedure follows that of standard decoder-only AR transformer with token-wise KV cache (Shazeer, 2019). As described in Section 3.4, to get z2i (a corresponding input token is vision condition vi), we apply CFG as z2i = znull 2i ), where Ï is guidance scale, zcond is the output given learnable null embedding, respectively. To get znull 2i , all the vi are replaced with the learnable null embedding. Sampling is done with bf16. 2i znull is the transformer output given the visual condition vi, and znull 2i 2i + Ï(zcond 2i and unconditional zuncond Our approach contrasts with the CFG strategy in the original MAR (Li et al., 2024), where CFG is applied within the diffusion head. In the original MAR, the transformer generates both conditional zcond vectors, which are then used for the standard CFG diffusion sampling. In contrast, we do not apply CFG within the diffusion head. We compare the performance of both CFG strategies in Appendix C.1. Our design choice has practical benefit, except for the performance: it reduces the computational overhead during sampling on the diffusion head, which might be critical when the head becomes larger or using the head without sampling acceleration. Diffusion head For the diffusion sampling on our Stage-1 model, we use the deterministic Heun solver with the same time-step discretizations as EDM (Karras et al., 2022; 2024). Namely, if we generate samples with -steps, tj = (t1/Ï 1 (t1/Ï max))Ï, where Ï = 7. On our Stage-2 model, we set intermediate time step = 2.5 and = [5.0, 1.1, 0.08] on NFE=2 and NFE=4, respectively. We use the EMA weights during sampling and set {tmax, tmin} = {80, 0.00} on the both Stage-1 and Stage2 (Karras et al., 2022; 2024; Song & Dhariwal, 2024; Geng et al., 2025b). Sampling is done with bf16. We provide the sampling procedure in Algorithm 3. min t1/Ï max + B.4 CONTEXT WINDOW EXTENSION ON ROPE In Section 4.4, we test our model on longer sequence generation beyond the training context window up to twice the trainig window on SoundReactor-ECT with NFE=4. In the experiments, we examine two zero-shot context window extension methods based on RoPE, Position Interpolation (PI) (Chen et al., 2023) and NTK-aware interpolation (NTK) (Tancik et al., 2020), and Sliding Window Attention (SWA) (Beltagy et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2023). Here, we describe those methods. RoPE is applied to both the query (q) and key (k) vectors within transformer layer. An input token zi is first projected into query vector qi = Wqzi and key vector ki = Wkzi, where qi, ki Rcz . To encode the positional information, the qi is treated as sequence of two-dimensional vectors (qi,2l1, qi,2l), where is the index ranging from 1 to cz/2. rotation is then applied to each pair as follows: (cid:19) (cid:18)q i,2l1 i,2l (cid:18)cos iÏl sin iÏl cos iÏl sin iÏl (cid:19) (cid:18)qi,2l1 qi,2l (cid:19) = , (10) where the frequency Ïl = Î¾2l/cz depends on the index and base Î¾. The same process is applied to the key vector ki. Position interpolation (PI) PI adapts RoPE to longer sequences by down-scaling the position indices via = (n/n), where and are training sequence length and target sequence length during inference, respectively. This operation uniformly compresses the entire frequency spectrum, which can degrade the models understanding of high-frequency details essential for precise temporal alignment."

            "content": "NTK-aware interpolation (NTK) Instead of scaling the position indices, NTK scales the base Î¾ of the frequency calculation to new value Î¾ = Î¾ (n/n)cz/(cz2). The approach is motivated by Neural Tangent Kernel theory (Tancik et al., 2020), which posits that deep neural networks have trouble learning high-frequency information if the input dimension is low without the corresponding embeddings having high-frequency components. NTKs base rescaling allows the model to retain its modeling capabilities on high-frequency information, which we qualitatively observe in Figure 3. Sliding window attention (SWA) Besides extending the context window, SWA is one of the standard and efficient attention mechanisms that restricts each token to only attend to fixed-size local window of preceding tokens. For generation beyond the training context window, it simply continues to apply this local attention window. While this approach is computationally efficient, its ability to model long-range dependencies is inherently limited by the fixed window size. Discussion In addition to quantitative evaluation in Section 4.4, the spectrogram visualization in Figure 3 shows that PI slows periodic sounds (e.g., footsteps) and harms temporal synchronization, while NTK and SWA preserve timing. We conjecture that this stems from how RoPE frequencies are scaled. Our interleaved, frame-aligned audiovisual tokens rely on high-frequency positional components for the precise timing of action sounds. NTK rescales the RoPE base and preserves high-frequency structure via Î¾ = Î¾ (n/n)cz/(cz2). In contrast, PI stretches positions in the time domain = (n/n), which lowers the angular frequency. This experiment is complementary to prior findings from the other domains, such as language domain, by demonstrating the superiority of NTK over PI in multimodal audio-visual setting. We validate its effectiveness through not only the quantitative performance difference but also the qualitative analysis of the spectrograms. B.5 PER-FRAME LATENCY MEASUREMENT We measure two metrics: waveform-level and token-level latency. Waveform-level latency is the elapsed time from feeding the previous audio token xi1 into the model until the output xi is incrementally decoded into waveform, including the encoding of the raw video frame Vi. Token-level latency is identical to this but excludes the incremental waveform decoding. Following Algorithm 3, we insert torch.cuda.synchronize() calls between lines 23 and 1415 to measure waveformlevel latency, and between lines 23 and 1112 to measure token-level latency. This duration is recorded as the per-frame latency. For each video, we average the per-frame latencies over all frames except the initial one. We perform this benchmark on single H100 GPU with batch size of one, using single CUDA stream for the entire pipeline. We use 53 clips (30FPS, 480p, 16 second) with the default SoundReactor-ECT at Ï = 3. We use NTK to generate 16 seconds with KV-cache10. We apply FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2024) for the main model. The torch.compile is enabled on the main model while CUDA Graph is used on the VAE decoder. We also enable the cuDNN auto-tuner (cudnn.benchmark = True). To measure the waveform-level latency, we use causal stereo fullband VAE, which is trained by fine-tuning our default VAE to make the decoder causal while freezing the encoder parameters. We provide the mean and standard deviation over the 50 clips following 3-clip warm-up period11. As demonstrated in Table 6, our model achieves both remarkably low per-frame token-level and waveform-level latency under NFE=1 to NFE=4 on the head. In terms of sample quality, we observe that the causal VAE decoder lags behind its non-causal counterpart in reconstruction quality (causal: rMMDOpenL3 = 62.7, rMMDCLAP = 0.538; non-causal: rMMDOpenL3 = 60.4, rMMDCLAP = 0.301). This performance gap propagates to final generation quality: e.g., our model on ECT (NFE=4) with the causal decoder yields MMDOpenL3 = 65.5 and MMDCLAP = 0.682, versus 64.6 and 0.451 with the non-causal one (our default setup). Accordingly, improving the fidelity of the causal VAE while keeping the decoding overhead small remains an important direction for future work. B.6 METRICS DETAILS Audio quality To evaluate audio quality, we use Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) (Gui et al., 2024), Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) (Chung et al., 2025; Jayasumana et al., 2024), and 10NTK, PI, and no RoPE extension do not affect latency. 11This is for excluding system warm-up effects, such as GPU kernel initialization."

We use 35 (60%CEV) for this experiment. larger head consistently yields better generation quality. Notably, while the original MAR generates valid images even with very small heads (e.g., 2M and 6M parameters) (Li et al., 2024), our 10M head variant failed to produce high-quality samples. We hypothesize this is due to the challenge of handling high-dimensional audio tokens (cx = 64)12. Indeed, our preliminary trials on an even higher dimension of cx = 128 yielded no valid audio even with 50 head. Consequently, the necessity of allocating substantial capacity to the diffusion head directly slows down decoding speed per token, providing strong motivation for the step-wise acceleration that we introduce in this work. 10M 30M 50M 70M (default) IB-Score DeSync 0.277 0.280 0.280 0.280 0.943 0.684 0.628 0.597 1.44 1.31 1.25 1.29 76.4 68.3 68.4 69.3 1.06 1.03 1.04 1.03 45.0 37.0 35.5 35. 1.66 1.56 1.56 1.56 Center Diff Center Diff KLPaSST OpenL3 CLAP Table 8: ECT fine-tuning with the entire network (Our default) and only with the diffusion head (Only head).

Differences between our strategy and MARs are described in Appendix B.3. scale Ï = 3.0. We observe that 10 steps (NFE=19) fail to generate valid samples, 20 steps (NFE=39) begin to yield reasonable samples, and 30 (NFE=59) or more steps are required for high-quality samples. These results motivate us to conduct diffusion head acceleration to achieve low per-frame latency. In Figure 7, we fix the number of steps to 30 and examine the impact of the CFG scale Ï. The results indicate an optimal performance range between Ï = 2.0 and Ï = 3.0. We also include results from = Concat(z2i1, zcond applying the original MARs CFG strategy to our models. Concretely, zcond 2i ) and zuncond 2i ) are used to conduct CFG sampling on the diffusion head (See the difference from our strategy explained in Algorithm 3 and Appendix B.3). While both strategies perform comparably, our approach is more computationally efficient, as noted in Appendix B.3, since our strategy does not use CFG on either diffusion or CM sampling. = Concat(z2i1, znull Figure 8 presents the objective metrics for SoundReactor-ECT across various NFEs and Ï values. Similar to the results for SoundReactor-Diffusion, we observe consistent performance sweet spot around Ï = 2.0 and Ï = 3.0 for all evaluated NFEs on the head. C.3 ABLATION STUDY ON VISION CONDITIONING Table 9: Varying dimensionality of PCA-reduced features and the impact of using our adjacent frame subtraction. Tested on SoundReactor-Diffusion. Bold and underlined scores indicate the best and second-best results, respectively. Influence of dimensionality reduction via PCA To investigate the influence of dimensionality reduction on the pretrained grid features by PCA (See Appendix B.1), we train the models with feature dimensions of 35, 59, and 99 dimensions, corresponding to CEV levels of 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively. All models in this specific experiment are trained with half the default batch size. As shown in Table 9, interestingly, even the compressed representation achieves better results on several metrics compared to its higher-dimensional counterparts. Although the dimensionality necessary for modeling is expected to vary across data distributions, our empirical results suggest that vision conditioning might be feasible with compact representations derived from selected subset of salient features. 35 (60% CEV) w/o. subtraction 59 (default) (70% CEV) w/o. subtraction 99 (80% CEV) w/o. subtraction 0.669 0.697 0.666 0.831 0.655 0.715 0.281 0.290 0.285 0.292 0.284 0.293 62.8 71.2 63.9 74.7 67.4 72.1 1.07 1.04 1.06 1.07 1.04 1.05 1.79 1.60 1.60 1.75 1.59 1.61 IB-Score DeSync OpenL3 CLAP Channel-dim KLPaSST MMD Effectiveness of adjacent frame subtraction We ablate our vision conditioning mechanism that utilizes temporal differences between adjacent grid features (described in Section 3.2). As demonstrated in Table 9, removing this component consistently degraded performance. This indicates that incorporating temporal information via frame differencing is crucial component of our vision conditioning."

(b) MMDOpenL3(Center) (d) IB-Score (c) KLPaSST C.4 SUPPLEMENTARY EXPERIMENTS ON VGGSOUND C.4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP As supplementary evaluation, we benchmark our framework against various offline V2A approaches on the VGGSound dataset (Chen et al., 2020b). VGGSound consists of 200K+ 10-second (around 500 hours) real-world uncurated video clips from YouTube spanning 309 categories. We follow the data split and preprocessing pipeline in MMAudio (Cheng et al., 2025), where the training set contains approximately 180K 8-second videos (around 400 hours). We use only audio-visual pairs, without their corresponding class labels. All data is processed at 30 FPS with 640 360 resolution and 48kHz stereo audio. For evaluation, consistent with previous work (Cheng et al., 2025; Zhong et al., 2025), we use 8-second clips from the VGGSound test set (15K videos). For objective metrics, we use Frechet Audio Distance (FADPaSST) (Gui et al., 2024) and KullbackLeibler divergence (KLPaSST) based on PaSST (Koutini et al., 2022), 32 kHz state-of-the-art audio classifier. For audio-visual alignment, we use ImageBind score (IB-Score) (Girdhar et al., 2023) and DeSync (Viertola et al., 2025), which is computed on the features extracted by Synchformer. We only compute these metrics on Center, derived by averaging the left and right channels. For the model training, we largely follow the default setup from our OGameData experiments (detailed in Appendix B), with the following exceptions: we use three-layer non-causal transformer for the aggregator (instead of single layer), 768-dimensional learnable token (instead of 512dimensional), and reduce the DINOv2 (dinov2-vits14-reg) grid feature dimension to 146 via PCA, retaining the CEV of 80%. For inference, we set Ï = 4.0 across all experiments and use 30-step deterministic Heun Solver for SoundReactor-Diffusion. For SoundReactor-ECT, we set intermediate time step = 2.5 and = [5.0, 1.1, 0.08] on NFE=2 and NFE=4, respectively. We use the causal stereo full-band VAE, which is trained by fine-tuning our default VAE to make both the encoder and decoder causal, for this experiment. C.4.2 RESULTS The results are presented in Table 10, with details of the baseline methods in Appendix A.1. Compared to the offline AR model, V-AURA, our framework shows similar trend on FADPaSST and DeSync as in the OGameData experiments, though it lags behind on IB-Score and KLPaSST. Against offline Non-AR models, our framework outperforms several methods such as Seeing & Hearing, ReWaS, and FoleyCrafter, while significant performance gap remains with MMAudio, which is the state-of-theart V2A model13. Overall, these results demonstrate that our framework is generalizable to real-world video datasets, despite some performance limitations. Demo samples of the VGGSound are available at https://koichi-saito-sony.github.io/soundreactor/vggsound.html. Potential avenues for bridging this performance gap include using larger image encoders such as CLIP-L (300M) and CLIP-H (840M) that used in the baselines (or the larger variants of DINOv2) or employing video encoders pre-trained on large-scale audio-visual datasets, which can extract video features under causal constraint. However, designing effective architectures that incorporate these components while preserving the end-to-end causality and low frame-level latency, which are crucial for the online V2A task, is non-trivial challenge. Therefore, we leave this as future work. 13We also observe that the DeSync appears to favor models that use Synchformer features, such as SpecMaskFoley, V-AURA, and MMAudio, which outperform the VAE reconstruction, suggesting potential methodological bias."
