Introduction Recent advances in reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by their ability to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories [12, 48]. Beyond enabling complex inference at test time, such trajectories also provide powerful supervision signals for training student models [28, 35] or cold-starting reinforcement learning [39] through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, stronger reasoning teachers do not necessarily yield better students [11, 22]. Our extensive experiments show that the post-training effectiveness of reasoning trajectories varies substantially across student models, indicating that the suitability between data and student is critical for effective learning. Existing data engineering methods assess data suitability primarily through the students probability assignments [18, 47], favoring high-likelihood trajectories that align closely with the models current behavior. Such trajectories, however, often provide limited new learning signals. In contrast, more informative trajectories are typically less familiar to the student and thus overlooked by these methods. This leads to fundamental Informative Alignment challenge: how to identify reasoning data that are both well aligned with the student and sufficiently informative? To address this challenge, we propose simple yet effective metric, Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), which quantifies the suitability of reasoning trajectory for given student by jointly capturing alignment and informativeness. Motivated by our preliminary analysis, we argue that the dilemma between providing new signals and aligning with students existing behavior can be resolved by trajectories exhibiting absolute unfamiliarity and relative familiarity. Concretely, effective trajectories should deviate from the students own generations, receiving low absolute probability under the student model, while still containing behavioral Corresponding authors.

Simple Metric of Informative Alignment patterns within the students prior experience, such that their tokens rank relatively high in the models prediction distribution over the vocabulary (Figure 1). Based on this insight and consistent numerical patterns observed in simulation studies, we define our suitability metric, Rank-Surprisal Ratio, as the ratio between trajectorys average token-wise rank1 and its average negative log-likelihood (surprisal). RSR can be computed with single forward pass, requires no additional verifier or test data, and is straightforward to interpret. Lower RSR indicates better informative alignment, identifying trajectories that are both informative and well aligned with the student. We validate the effectiveness of Rank-Surprisal Ratio through correlation analyses on 5 student LLMs using math reasoning trajectories generated by 11 representative teacher models. Across all students, the RSR of trajectories exhibits strong correlation with post-training performance, achieving an average Spearman correlation of 0.86 and consistently outperforming alternative metrics. Furthermore, to explore its practical value in data engineering, we apply RSR to trajectory selection and teacher selection. Our experiments show that RSR not only selects more effective training trajectories for each problem from candidates generated by diverse teachers, but also identifies more suitable teacher models using only small amount of data, consistently outperforming existing selection methods across all five students in both settings. Figure 1: Illustration of the intuition behind RSR. Suitable reasoning trajectories should balance informativeness and alignment by having low absolute probability but relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model. Our main contributions are three-fold: We present systematic distillation study across wide range of teacher and student models, showing that the effectiveness of reasoning trajectories differs across students and highlighting the importance of datastudent suitability. We propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio, simple metric that quantifies the suitability of reasoning trajectory by jointly capturing alignment and informativeness, achieving strong correlation with post-training performance. We demonstrate the practical utility of Rank-Surprisal Ratio in two data engineering scenarios, trajectory selection and teacher selection, where it serves as an effective criterion and outperforms existing methods. 2. The Need for Student-Specific Data To understand which types of reasoning trajectories most effectively improve student models after SFT, we conduct comprehensive large-scale study involving five widely adopted student models and eleven diverse reasoning-oriented teacher models, yielding 55 teacherstudent pairings. We perform SFT experiments for each of these pairs. 2.1. Experimental Settings Our teacher-student pairing study involves two major steps: (1) For each teacher model, we prompt it to generate long CoT response for each math problem in our 5000-problem set (see A.1), forming trajectory dataset specific to that teacher. (2) For each teacherstudent pair, we fine-tune the student model on the corresponding teacher dataset and evaluate its reasoning performance. All students are pretrained base models. To reduce variance induced by stochastic trajectory sampling, we perform three independent generation runs for each teacher and conduct SFT separately on each resulting dataset for every teacherstudent pair. Reported results are averaged over these three runs. More implementation details are provided in the appendix. 1Higher-ranked tokens have lower rank values. 2 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better?

Student performance varies significantly across teacherstudent pairs, highlighting the importance of datastudent suitability. Teachers We use 11 reasoning LLMs spanning 4B to 671B parameters across multiple model families, including GPT-OSS [3], DeepSeek [12], Qwen [39], LLaMA-Nemotron [4], and Phi [1]. Benchmarks We evaluate the reasoning performance of the fine-tuned student models on four standard math benchmarks: AIME25, AIME24, AMC23, and MATH500 [14] using the Acc@4 metric, and report results averaged across all benchmarks. 2.2. Results Table 1 presents the results of our teacherstudent pairing distillation study, revealing that: Teacher capability, whether measured by Stronger teachers do not necessarily produce better students. parameter scale or reasoning performance, does not reliably predict student improvement. For example, the 671B and 235B models often underperform smaller teachers such as QwQ-32B on multiple students. Similarly, teachers with strong reasoning performance do not consistently yield the best outcomes for all student models. The effectiveness of teacher Datastudent suitability is critical for eliciting reasoning improvements. trajectories is highly student-specific and depends critically on their suitability for the student model. Pairing strong teachers (Deepseek-R1) with much weaker students (Qwen-2.5-3B) often fails to yield strong performance, while weaker teachers (Qwen-3-4B-Thinking) may likewise be ineffective at improving stronger students (Qwen-3-14B). Moreover, teachers from distant model families (GPT-OSS) often lead to inferior results, suggesting that unfamiliar reasoning patterns are harder for students to absorb. Overall, we find no simple teacherstudent pairing rule based on surface attributes such as parameter scale or model family, indicating that reasoning data suitability is nuanced property requiring deeper investigation. 3. Measuring Data-Student Suitability In this section, we explore metrics for measuring datastudent suitability, with the goal of jointly capturing informativeness and alignment. We begin by introducing two fundamental token-level measures: surprisal and rank ( 3.1), and analyzing the limitations of existing probability-based metrics ( 3.2). We then abstract our insights on suitable reasoning data and conduct simulation studies to identify quantitative patterns ( 3.3). Finally, we propose our trajectory-level metric ( 3.4). 3.1. Surprisal and Rank We introduce two different methods to quantify the amount of information carried by token with respect to student model. They serve as building blocks of our metric. Surprisal (Negative Log-Likelihood) common measure is based on the probability of generating the 3 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better?

Complete metric scores are provided in C.2. current token 𝑡𝑘 given its preceding context c𝑘 = (𝑡1, . . . , 𝑡𝑘1) under the student model 𝜃. For numerical stability, probabilities are typically transformed into the log space, and the negative log-likelihood is used as measure of informativeness, also known as Surprisal [13] Surprisal(𝑡𝑘) = log 𝑝𝜃 (𝑡𝑘 c𝑘 ) (1) Another method considers the rank of the current token within the models prediction distribution Rank over the vocabulary 𝒱. Formally, given the conditional distribution 𝑝𝜃( c𝑘), the rank of token 𝑡𝑘 is defined as the number of tokens with strictly higher probability [32]. Rank(𝑡𝑘) = 1 + 𝑡𝒱 I[𝑝𝜃(𝑡 c𝑘) > 𝑝𝜃(𝑡𝑘 c𝑘)] (2) Unlike surprisal, rank captures relative familiarity of the token by comparing target token against alternative candidates, revealing signals overlooked by probability-based measures. For instance, token may receive low absolute probability while still being among the top-ranked candidates. 3.2. Limitations of Probability-Based Metrics Existing work primarily relies on surprisal or log-probability to assess data suitability. For example, Zhang et al. [47] selects trajectories based on the average log-probability of response tokens under the student model. Since surprisal is the negation of log-probability, we implement this metric as the average surprisal, denoted as Avg-Surprisal. More recently, Just et al. [18] computes token-level log-probability based on local context clocal (several preceding sentences), which we implement as average local surprisal (Avg-Surplocal). Under these 𝑘 metrics, trajectories with lower surprisal are considered more suitable. However, as shown in Table 2, lower surprisal (i.e., higher probability) does not necessarily lead to better posttraining reasoning performance. Both Avg-Surprisal and Avg-Surplocal assign lower surprisal to trajectories from Nemotron-Super and Magistral-Small, yet training on such trajectories fails to improve reasoning performance. Similar patterns are observed across all student models, indicating that probability-based metrics tend to favor data that are familiar but insufficiently informative. At the other extreme, trajectories with very high surprisal (e.g., GPT-OSS-20B) also perform poorly. In contrast, trajectories with moderate surprisal values (e.g., Qwen-3-8B) achieve better results. This observation motivates us to investigate the mechanism underlying the surprisal trade-off. 3.3. Insight and Simulation The above analysis suggests that effective teacher trajectories should balance the informativeness of the data with their alignment to the students current behavior: they should be neither overly similar to the students own generations nor excessively deviant from its predicted distribution. 4 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better?

Table 3: Simulation results for different types of trajectories, reporting average token probability, surprisal, rank, and RSRtoken. RSRtoken shows promise as reliable metric for identifying suitable reasoning trajectories ( 3.4). At first glance, this balance may appear to pose dilemma. However, we argue that it can be resolved by viewing informativeness and alignment through the lens of absolute unfamiliarity and relative familiarity. Informativeness does not require trajectories to be entirely unfamiliar; rather, it suffices that they deviate from the dominant patterns and thus have low absolute probability of being generated by the student. Conversely, alignment does not require exact agreement with the students outputs, but instead that the corresponding tokens have relatively higher likelihoods than other candidates in the vocabulary. Building on this insight, we propose that effective reasoning trajectories should deviate from the students own generations while still exhibiting behavioral patterns within the students prior experience. Therefore, tokens in such trajectories are assigned low absolute probability (high surprisal) by the student model while still ranking relatively high (low rank values) in its prediction distribution. To validate these quantitative patterns and identify features that characterize effective learning trajectories, we conduct simulation study. Simulation Setting We simulate the student models token-level prediction distribution for reasoning trajectories and examine the numerical patterns exhibited by teacher trajectories that we consider effective. Specifically, we model the students prediction distribution as bimodal distribution over the vocabulary 𝒱. The first mode, denoted as 𝑍𝐴, represents tokens that follow the students dominant patterns, which arise from students massive general training data. The second mode 𝑍𝐵, represents tokens whose patterns resemble strong reasoning trajectories, reflecting the students prior exposure to relevant data. We instantiate both 𝑍𝐴 and 𝑍𝐵 as Zipf distributions [26, 52] over 𝒱. Then the students overall token-level prediction distribution 𝑍 is constructed as mixture of 𝑍𝐴 and 𝑍𝐵: 𝑍 = 𝜋 𝑍𝐴 + (1 𝜋) 𝑍𝐵, 𝑍𝐴, 𝑍𝐵 Zipf(𝛼), (3) where 𝜋 = 𝑀𝐴 𝑀𝐴+𝑀𝐵 and 𝑀𝐴 > 𝑀𝐵. Based on 𝑍, we simulate four types of reasoning trajectories and examine their token-level surprisal and rank: (i) 𝑋𝐴, sampled from 𝑍𝐴, representing trajectories that closely follow the students dominant patterns; (ii) 𝑋𝐵, sampled from 𝑍𝐵, representing trajectories that deviate from the dominant mode while aligning with certain minor patterns within the student; (iii) 𝑋𝐶, sampled from distribution distinct from both 𝑍𝐴 and 𝑍𝐵, representing misaligned trajectories; and (iv) 𝑋𝐷, sampled from 𝑍, representing trajectories that reflect the students overall predictive behavior. More simulation details are provided in A.6. Figure 2 presents the simulated bimodal distribution 𝑍, where effective reasoning Simulation Results trajectories are expected to align with the distribution of 𝑍𝐵, and thus resemble 𝑋𝐵. As shown in Table 3, 𝑋𝐵 exhibits much higher average surprisal (lower absolute probability) than 𝑋𝐴 and 𝑋𝐷, while maintaining relatively low rank values (higher-ranked), consistent with the quantitative patterns implied by our analysis. Crucially, the results suggest promising direction for measuring data suitability, which we formalize in 3.4. 5 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? Simple Metric of Informative Alignment 3.4. Proposed Metric: Rank-Surprisal Ratio Token-Level Metric Motivated by the complementary properties of surprisal and rank, we explore metrics that combine these two signals to jointly capture informativeness and alignment. One promising choice is the token-level ratio of rank to surprisal, which captures the relative relationship between the two signals and is denoted as RSRtoken: RSRtoken(𝑡𝑘) = Rank(𝑡𝑘) Surprisal(𝑡𝑘) . (4) Table 3 shows that trajectories of the preferred type 𝑋𝐵 achieve the lowest average RSRtoken (1.30), whereas the misaligned 𝑋𝐶 achieve the highest, suggesting that this ratio may be reliable indicator for identifying effective reasoning trajectories that balance informativeness and alignment. From Token-Level to Trajectory-Level While RSRtoken shows encouraging behavior in simulation, directly applying this token-level ratio to assess the overall suitability of real trajectory presents non-trivial challenges. In particular, naively averaging RSRtoken over all response tokens often leads to large and unstable values  (Table 2)  . This instability stems from tokens that receive extremely high probabilities under certain contexts, yielding near-zero surprisal and unbounded ratios that dominate the trajectory-level average. natural solution is to exclude tokens with very low surprisal when computing the average. Let 𝒯𝐻 (x) denote the set of response tokens whose surprisal lies in the top 𝐻% within trajectory x. We define filtered average as Avg-RSRfilter token(x) = 𝑡𝑘𝒯𝐻 (x) RSRtoken(𝑡𝑘) 𝒯𝐻 (x) Empirically, we find that using the top 30% highest-surprisal tokens yields stronger correlation with posttraining performance  (Table 2)  . This suggests that tokens with higher surprisal have greater impact on student learning and should be emphasized when computing the average. Accordingly, instead of hard filtering, we adopt surprisal-weighted average of the token-level ratios. simple derivation shows that this weighted average is equivalent to trajectory-level ratio between the sum of token ranks and the sum of token surprisals. For brevity, we denote 𝑟𝑘 = Rank(𝑡𝑘) and 𝑠𝑘 = Surprisal(𝑡𝑘): 𝑘 𝑠𝑘 RSRtoken(𝑡𝑘) 𝑘 𝑠𝑘 = 𝑟𝑘 𝑘 𝑠𝑘 𝑠𝑘 𝑘 𝑠𝑘 = 𝑘 Rank(𝑡𝑘) 𝑘 Surprisal(𝑡𝑘) The resulting metric yields concise form that can be interpreted as the ratio of average rank to average surprisal at the trajectory level. In practice, we further observe that extremely unfamiliar tokens can attain very large rank values due to the large vocabulary size, which also leads to numerical instability. Since tokens with excessively large ranks are effectively indistinguishable from the students perspective, we clip rank values at threshold 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥. Thus, we define our final trajectory-level metric, Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), as ) 𝑘 min(Rank(𝑡𝑘), 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑘 Surprisal(𝑡𝑘) RSR(x) = (7) Interpretation Our metric admits simple interpretation. The numerator, Rank, captures relative familiarity: lower rank values indicate that tokens in this trajectory are preferred among alternative candidates by the student and align with the models existing behavior. The denominator, Surprisal, captures absolute unfamiliarity: higher surprisal indicates deviation from dominant patterns and provides informative learning signals. lower RSR therefore identifies trajectories that better balance alignment and informativeness, corresponding to effective reasoning supervision. 4. Correlation Analysis Preliminary results in Table 2 have shown that Rank-Surprisal Ratio aligns well with post-training reasoning performance. To provide more rigorous evaluation and further demonstrate the effectiveness of RSR in measuring data-student suitability, we conduct comprehensive correlation analyses. 6 (5) (6) Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better?

Table 4: Spearman correlation between different metrics and post-training reasoning performance across student models, reporting absolute values. \"Student-Agnostic\" metrics are computed independently of the specific student model. Our metric, Rank-Surprisal Ratio, achieves the highest correlation across all students. 4.1. Main Analysis For each of the five student models, we compute average trajectory-level suitability (or quality) scores for reasoning datasets generated by eleven teacher models ( 2.1) using different metrics. We then measure the correlation between these dataset-level scores and the students average post-training reasoning performance on the corresponding teacher data. We primarily report Spearmans correlation coefficient, as Pearson correlation exhibits similar trends. We use clipping threshold 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 100 for our RSR metric in all subsequent experiments. Additional analysis details are provided in A.7, and complete metric scores are reported in C.2. Compared Metrics We compare RSR against diverse set of metrics for evaluating reasoning trajectories. These include previously discussed teacher-side indicators (e.g., teacher model performance), basic statistics such as token length, as well as probability-based metrics (e.g., average surprisal and local surprisal; [18]) and rank-based metrics. We also consider commonly used trajectory quality measures, such as rule-based quality scores derived from word frequency [43], LLM-judged quality scores, and answer accuracy on verifiable questions. In addition, we include recent student-specific data suitability metrics, including gradient-based scores (G-Norm and GRACE; [29]) and influence scores [16]. Table 4 shows that Rank-Surprisal Ratio consistently exhibits strong correlation with post-training Results reasoning performance across all student models, achieving an average Spearman correlation of 0.86 and outperforming all alternative metrics. These results indicate the effectiveness and practical value of RSR. In contrast, surprisal-based and rank-based metrics alone yield substantially weaker correlations (at most 0.59), highlighting the importance of capturing both informativeness and alignment through the rank-surprisal ratio. 4.2. Ablation Study The derivation of Rank-Surprisal Ratio involves several design components as well as hyperparameter 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥. We conduct an ablation study to examine how these choices affect correlation performance. As shown in Table 5, removing either rank clipping or the surprisal-weighted averaging substantially degrades the correlation, validating the necessity of both components in our metric. In addition, the Reduced sample size setting estimates the dataset-level RSR using only 200 trajectories per teacher instead of the full 5,000.

More ablation results are provided in C.3. 5. Practical Applications Given the reliable data-student suitability estimation provided by Rank-Surprisal Ratio and its strong correlation with post-training performance, we further examine its practical value as data selection criterion in two representative scenarios. 5.1. Trajectory Selection The trajectory selection task aims to identify the most effective reasoning trajectory Experimental Setting from set of candidates for given problem or prompt. We adopt 33-to-1 setting, where each candidate pool contains 33 trajectories generated by 11 teacher models (3 per teacher; see 2.1), and one trajectory is selected according to the selection criterion. This procedure is repeated for all 5,000 training problems and all student models, yielding student-specific 5,000-trajectory teacher datasets for each selection method. We then fine-tune student models on the constructed datasets and evaluate their post-training reasoning performance on standard math benchmarks, consistent with previous experiments. We compare RSR against random selection baseline and multiple previously discussed metrics. For metric-based methods, candidate trajectories are scored and selected by either maximizing or minimizing the score. Results As shown in Table 6, datasets selected by Rank-Surprisal Ratio consistently achieve the best posttraining reasoning performance among all selection methods across student models, demonstrating the effectiveness of RSR in identifying suitable trajectories. Moreover, the performance achieved by RSR is comparable to, and for four students even surpasses, the best performance of any single teacher for each student model  (Table 1)  , which serves as strong upper bound obtained via brute-force search over teacher datasets. These results underscore the practical value of RSR for selecting effective trajectories prior to training. Additional trajectory selection results, including complete scores, further analysis, GPQA evaluation, and experiments under reduced-teacher setting, are provided in C.4. 5.2. Teacher Selection The teacher selection task aims to identify the most suitable teacher model for Experimental Setting generating reasoning trajectories to train given student. We consider low-resource setting in which generating full training data for every teacher model is infeasible. Instead, we sample small set of 200 trajectories from each candidate teacher, score them using different metrics, and select the teacher model based on the average trajectory-level score. We use 6 diverse teacher models (Deepseek-R1, Qwen-3-235B-Thinking, Nemotron-Super, Qwen-3-30B-Thinking, Magistral-Small, and GPT-OSS-20B) as the candidate pool, avoiding consistently well-performing teachers to ensure non-trivial selection task.

Results As shown in Table 7, both the best and second-best teachers selected by Rank-Surprisal Ratio yield strong post-training reasoning performance, achieving average results close to oracle teachers and outperforming other selection methods. Notably, as also observed in our ablation study  (Table 5)  , RSR remains effective when using only 200 trajectories per teacher for measurement, highlighting its robustness and practical value for identifying suitable teachers in low-resource settings. 6. Related Work Knowledge distillation is powerful approach for transferring knowledge from Knowledge Distillation large models to smaller ones [15], and has been widely used in training LLMs [30]. Prior work shows that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, often due to capability gaps [24, 46] or off-policy data [5]. Recent studies address this by better aligning teacher supervision with student behavior, achieving an implicit balance through approaches such as on-policy distillation [2], integration with reinforcement learning [25, 49], SFT optimization [37, 42], teaching assistants [8, 27], and interleaved sampling [31, 38]. By contrast, our work explicitly quantifies the trade-off between informativeness and alignment in distillation, enabling principled identification of effective teacher data for given student. Long CoT trajectories provide strong supervision for improving student SFT with Reasoning Trajectories models reasoning performance via SFT [34, 35]. In line with findings in the general domain that high-quality data improves SFT [41, 51], many studies focus on constructing high-quality CoT data, either by selecting better prompts [40, 44] or by filtering reasoning trajectories [6, 17, 23, 36, 43, 53]. Recognizing that optimal reasoning data may vary across students, recent work explores student-specific trajectory selection strategies [16, 18, 29]. Our work also studies student-specific data selection, but differs from prior work by measuring datastudent suitability from the perspective of informative alignment and by conducting more comprehensive evaluations across wider range of teacher models. 7. Conclusion In this paper, we study datastudent suitability in reasoning distillation and propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), simple metric for identifying suitable reasoning trajectories for given student. Motivated by our analysis, RSR jointly captures trajectorys informativeness and alignment with the students behavior, favoring trajectories with low absolute probability but relatively high-ranked tokens. Experiments across diverse teacherstudent pairs show that RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance and consistently outperforms existing metrics. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in both trajectory and teacher selection. Overall, our results highlight informative alignment as promising direction for reasoning distillation. 9 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better?

            "content": "Although our work proposes an effective metric for selecting reasoning trajectories to distill student models, the performance of data selection is inherently constrained by the diversity and quality of candidate trajectories or teacher models. When none of the available teacher trajectories are well suited to given student, the gains from selection alone may be limited. promising direction for future work is to use our metric to guide the rewriting or synthesis of reasoning trajectories, rather than selecting from fixed pool. In addition, the derived metric takes simple and intuitive form with clear interpretation. However, it remains unclear whether it arises from deeper mathematical principles. We have not yet identified suitable theoretical framework to analyze this aspect, which we leave for future investigation. Finally, due to resource constraints, we primarily focus on mathematical reasoning tasks with extensive controlled studies, while also including additional evaluation on GPQA. Extending our evaluation to other domains,such as code or additional forms of reasoning, would be valuable. However, since our analysis relies on large-scale trajectory generation and approximately 200 SFT experiments, such extensions would require substantially greater computational resources and are therefore left for future work."

Simple Metric of Informative Alignment A. Details of Experiments A.1. Determining Training Problem Set All teacher trajectory datasets are constructed using fixed problem set to avoid confounding effects from variations in problem composition. We focus on mathematical reasoning and curate 5,000 math problems from the widely used NuminaMath dataset [21]. Following prior work [20], we apply preprocessing steps such as difficulty filtering to ensure the problem quality. Specifically, our training dataset consists of problems drawn from the MATH, AIME/AMC, and Olympiads. SkyThought provides difficulty-labeled version of NuminaMath in which each problem is assigned an integer difficulty score from 0 to 9. Using this scale, we randomly sampled 1,667 problems from the MATH subset with difficulty above three, 1,667 problems from the Olympiads subset with difficulty above eight, and 1,666 problems from the AIME/AMC subset, yielding balanced training set of 5,000 problems. We choose 5,000 training problems for three main reasons. First, prior studies have shown that strong reasoning capabilities can be learned from training sets of around 1,000 problems. Second, high-quality reasoning problems are relatively scarce, making further scaling less effective in practice. Third, our cross-study incurs quadratic computational cost across teacherstudent pairs. Considering these factors, we find 5,000 problems to offer good trade-off between representativeness and computational feasibility. A.2. Teacher Trajectory Generation For each teacher model, we generate reasoning trajectories for 5,000 problems over three independent runs using vLLM [19] under maximum generation budget of 31,000 tokens. We adopt the official model sampling hyperparameters and prompt template recommendation; for example, Qwen models use temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, and min_p=0. Each problem is appended with the instruction: \"Return your final response within boxed{}.\" If sampled trajectory exceeds the token budget, we resample up to 10 times; if all attempts still exceed the budget, we truncate the final trajectory. Across all teacher models, truncation rates are below 1%, which helps preserve the quality of training trajectories even for teachers that tend to produce long outputs. The resulting training dataset of teacher trajectories is constructed by using the original problem as the user prompt and prepending the system prompt: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within boxed{}.\" to each problem. A.3. Teacher Models and Student Models As discussed earlier, our experiments adopt more diverse set of teacher models than prior work. Specifically, we consider the teacher variants shown in Table 8. For student models, we select five open-source pretrained base models from the Qwen and LLaMA families: Qwen-3-14B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Qwen-3-4B, and Qwen-2.5-3B. A.4.

Our evaluated benchmarks, AIME25, AIME24, AMC23, and MATH500, are widely used and span varying difficulty levels, assessing mathematical reasoning and multistep problem-solving across diverse domains. We additionally conduct evaluation on GPQA-Diamond beyond mathematics, as described in C.4.2. We adopt the Acc@4 metric as the final score, which averages results over four independent evaluations per problem. Evaluating single model checkpoint typically takes around half an hour using 8 H200 GPUs. Table 8: List of teacher models used in our experiments. 15 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? Simple Metric of Informative Alignment During inference, we use temperature of 0.6, top_p of 0.95, and top_k set to 1. The maximum generation length is set to 32,768 tokens, consistent with the maximum sequence length used during finetuning. Responses that exceed this limit are truncated. This differs from trajectory generation, where we resample multiple times to avoid truncation, as here we aim to evaluate the models reasoning ability under fixed context-length constraint. Under this setting, the comparable performance of the Qwen-3-235B and Qwen-3-30B in Table 1 may be attributable to truncation effects, which we consider reasonable outcome given the imposed length limit. A.5. Details of Model Fine-Tuning We use LLaMA-Factory [50] framework to conduct SFT with reasoning trajectory datasets. For different student models, we conduct grid search for best set of hyperparameters. The final setting is reported in the Table 9. During SFT, all student models use maximum sequence length of 32,768.

Table 9: Training hyperparameters for different student models. For trajectory selection experiments in 5.1, we fine-tune each selected dataset with three different random seeds and report performance averaged over these runs. For teacherstudent distillation experiments in 2.1, however, each teacher already yields three independent trajectory datasets, so we do not further vary random seeds for fine-tuning. A.6. Details of Simulation Study In practice, we simulate 𝑍 by sampling 𝑀𝐴 tokens from 𝑍𝐴 and 𝑀𝐵 tokens from 𝑍𝐵. We use 𝑀𝐴 = 1,000,000, 𝑀𝐵 = 250,000, 𝒱 = 50, and for each simulated dataset, we sample 10,000 tokens to compute average metrics. Based on preliminary fit to reasoning data, we set the Zipf exponent to 𝛼 = 2.3. Figure 3 depicts the distributions of 𝑍𝐴 and 𝑍𝐵 over the vocabulary, with their mixture representing the simulated token-level prediction distribution 𝑍 of the student model. Figure 2 is derived from this by ranking the tokens from higher to lower probability. A.7. Details of Correlation Analysis Figure 3: Simulation of the student models tokenlevel prediction distribution 𝑍, mixture of Zipf distributions 𝑍𝐴 and 𝑍𝐵. We use the Spearman correlation coefficient [45] because our analysis focuses on monotonic consistency rather than strict linear relationships between metrics and post-training performance. We also report Pearson correlation results [7] in C.2. We report the absolute values of Spearman correlation coefficients in Table 4. For the Average values, however, we first average the correlation coefficients across student models and then take the absolute value. We consider this aggregation more appropriate, as correlations with opposite signs across different student models should offset each other; consequently, this averaged value can be lower than the result obtained by averaging absolute correlations. Since post-training performance is computed by averaging three generation runs per teacher ( 2.1), we likewise average the dataset-level metric over the three trajectory datasets generated by the same teacher to obtain its final score. We observe that our datset-level metric varies marginally across different datasets generated by the same teacher. 16 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? Simple Metric of Informative Alignment B. Details of Compared Metrics B.1. LLM-judged Quality We use Qwen3-32B-Instruct in Non-Thinking configuration as an automatic judge to evaluate reasoning trajectories. Under fixed evaluation prompt, the judge produces structured assessment at two levels. First, it assigns dimension-wise scores over five criteriaFactual Accuracy, Logical Rigor, Solution Completeness, Reasoning Efficiency, and Presentation Qualityeach accompanied by brief justification. Second, it aggregates the dimensional assessments into an overall score in [0, 1] together with concise rationale. For dataset-level comparison, we report the mean of the trajectory-level overall scores. The complete evaluation prompt is given in Table 27, adapted from [9]. B.2. Rule-based Quality We implement the rule-based criterion used for filtering the LIMO Dataset [43]. Each response is scored using the following weighted indicators: Elaborated reasoning (30%): total word length. Self-Verification (20%): frequency of \"check\" and \"verify\". Exploratory Approach (25%): frequency of \"perhaps\" and \"might\". Adaptive Granularity (25%): frequency of \"therefore\" and \"since\". To ensure fair comparison across responses of varying lengths, we compute relative keyword frequencies by normalizing absolute keyword counts with respect to the total word count. To account for differences in scale across criteria, we then independently standardize each criterions scores into z-scores, which empirically improves correlation. B.3. Influence Score We adopt the Influence Score method based on the second-order approximation of Influence Functions [16]. The core principle is to treat the infinitesimal up-weighting of training sample as local perturbation to the optimization objective, thereby estimating the induced marginal change in the loss of the evaluation set. In this framework, higher influence score signifies that the gradient direction of the training sample aligns with minimizing the evaluation loss in the neighborhood of the converged parameters. We implement this baseline using the Kronfluence framework. To make the computation tractable for LLMs, we employ the EK-FAC strategy to approximate the Hessian matrix [10]. Specifically, we first precompute the EK-FAC factors on reference model. Since we do not know which trajectory is better priori, we use the model trained with randomly selected trajectories per problem as the reference model, corresponding to the Random variant in Table 6. Then, we compute the pairwise influence scores between the training samples and the evaluation dataset. To optimize for memory and computational efficiency, we apply low-rank approximation to the query gradients (rank = 4) and utilize bfloat16 precision for the Inverse Hessian-Vector Product calculations. Finally, we average these pairwise scores across the evaluation set to obtain the sample-level influence score 𝑠(𝑑), which serves as our baseline for ranking data suitability. B.4. G-Norm G-Norm [29] assesses the suitability of generated data for student model by measuring the magnitude of the students local gradient signal induced by the data. Formally, G-Norm calculates the magnitude of the loss gradient with respect to the student models parameters. To address the computational constraints associated with high-dimensional parameter spaces, the method utilizes random projection for dimensionality reduction. For each reasoning trajectory (𝑥, 𝑦), we compute the gradient of the loss derived from the student model and apply length normalization to eliminate bias towards longer sequences. These gradients are then projected onto lower-dimensional subspace via fixed random matrix, followed by the computation of their 𝐿2 norms. B.5. GRACE We adopt GRACE [29] as baseline metric for further evaluating the generated reasoning trajectory dataset from gradient-based perspective. GRACE characterizes the geometry of the optimization landscape by analyzing 17 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? Simple Metric of Informative Alignment Metrics Rank-Surprisal Ratio Spearman Pearson Student Models Qwen-3-14B LLaMA-3.1-8B Qwen-2.5-7B Qwen-3-4B Qwen-2.5-3B Average 0.856 0.794 0.918 0.805 0.845 0.880 0.845 0.811 0.855 0.654 0.818 0. Table 10: Comparison of Spearman and Pearson correlation results on Rank-Surprisal Ratio (absolute values). the spectral structure of the student model gradients. This approach allows for holistic assessment of how effectively the generated data spans the parameter space required for model optimization. The calculation proceeds by first projecting the high-dimensional gradients onto lower-dimensional subspace via fixed random matrix to ensure computational feasibility. To address the empirical tendency of gradient norms to diminish in longer sequences, the method rescales the projected vectors logarithmically based on the response length. GRACE then computes the metric using cross-validation strategy where the dataset is divided into multiple partitions. The gradients from held-out partition are weighted by the regularized inverse covariance matrix estimated from the remaining data. This process effectively quantifies the expected squared norm of the gradients after whitening them with the estimated spectrum of the distribution. Because GRACEs cross-validation strategy yields dataset-level metric rather than per-sample score, we apply GRACE for teacher selection but not for trajectory-level selection. B.6. Others Here we give formal definitions for Avg-Surprisal and Avg-Surplocal. Given trajectory 𝑥 = (𝑡1, . . . , 𝑡𝑇 ), Avg_Surprisal(x) = 1 𝑇 𝑇 𝑘=1 log 𝑝𝜃(𝑡𝑘 c𝑘) Avg_Surplocal(x) = 1 𝑇 𝑇 𝑘=1 log 𝑝𝜃(𝑡𝑘 clocal 𝑘 ) (8) (9) C. More Results and Analysis C.1. Computational Cost for Rank-Surprisal Ratio The computation of Rank-Surprisal Ratio requires only single forward pass through the student model. During the forward pass, we collect each tokens surprisal and rank from the model logits. Computing RankSurprisal Ratio over the 5,000-trajectory dataset typically takes about one hour on single H200 GPU, which is significantly cheaper than SFT. C.2. Additional Results for Correlation Analysis Table 10 compares Spearman and Pearson correlations. The results show that Rank-Surprisal Ratio also exhibits strong Pearson correlation with post-training performance. Table 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26 present the full metric assessment results across different teacher trajectory datasets on Qwen-3-14B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Qwen-3-4B, and Qwen-2.5-3B, respectively. C.3. Additional Ablation Study We conduct some additional ablation studies. Results are shown in Table 11. The Fixed student variant computes RSR using fixed model (Qwen-3-14B) instead of the target student, and the resulting drop in correlation highlights the importance of student-specific estimation. Avg-Rank (clip at 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 100) applies rank clipping to Avg-Rank, but it still fails to achieve better correlation than rank alone. Rank Minus Surprisal is computed by subtracting the surprisal from the (clipped) rank. Although this 18 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better?

RankEntropy Ratio is computed as the ratio between the (clipped) average rank and the average token entropy, where entropy is loosely related to surprisal. While it achieves good correlation, its correlation is still lower than that of RSR. We also experiment with different exponent choices when computing Rank-Surprisal Ratio (with the default setting corresponding to power 1 for both rank and surprisal), for example \"use Rank1.05\". The results indicate that our metric is robust to these variations and may yield higher correlation with hyperparameter tuning. Nevertheless, we use the default power-1 setting to keep the formulation simple. C.4. Additional Results for Trajectory Selection C.4.1.

Table 12 presents trajectory selection results for two selection method variants based on Rank-Surprisal Ratio, offering further insights. For \"With Correctness Filtering\", we consider combined setting that uses both RSR and verified correctness for trajectory selection. Specifically, for problems with verifiably correct trajectories, we first discard incorrect ones and then select among the remaining correct trajectories based on RSR. The results show no significant improvement over selecting trajectories solely based on RSR, particularly for larger student models. This suggests that correctness is sometimes less critical than overall data suitability. For \"Fewer Candidates per Teacher\", we evaluate an 11-to-1 setting in which each candidate pool contains 11 teacher trajectories (one per teacher), instead of the original 33-to-1 setting (three per teacher). This setting focuses on selecting the best trajectory for each problem across different teachers, rather than across multiple generations from the same teacher. The results are comparable, with slight performance gap relative to the 33-to-1 setting, indicating that RSR remains effective even when each teacher provides only single trajectory. These findings further suggest that while RSR captures suitability differences across generations from the same teacher, such differences are less pronounced than those across different teacher models. C.4.2. Additional Evaluation on GPQA and Full Results To more comprehensively evaluate the impact of different trajectory selection methods on post-trained models reasoning capabilities beyond mathematical problems, we conduct additional evaluation on the GPQA-Diamond benchmark [33].

Table 13 summarizes the evaluation results of different trajectory selection methods on GPQA-Diamond. Although the results are less stable than those on mathematical benchmarks due to the out-of-domain nature of this evaluation, datasets selected by RSR still achieve the best overall post-training performance. This suggests that RSR can identify suitable trajectories that consistently improve student models general reasoning capabilities, even when training solely on mathematical problems. The complete trajectory selection results underlying Table 6 are presented in Table 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. C.4.3.

Table 14: Data composition and metrics of trajectory datasets selected by RSR in the trajectory selection experiments ( 5.1) across different student models. Model names are abbreviated as for Qwen and for LLaMA. Table 14 shows the data composition of datasets selected by RSR across 11 teacher models. The resulting distributions vary across student models, demonstrating the metrics ability to select different teacher trajectories tailored to different students. QwQ-32B is generally preferred across student models, consistent with its stable performance. For clearer contrast in data composition among student models, we refer readers to C.4.4, where trajectory selection is performed with fewer teachers and consistently strong teachers such as QwQ-32B are removed. The RSR values of the selected datasets are also reported in Table 14. These datasets consistently achieve substantially lower RSR values than the teacher trajectory datasets (see C.2 for complete metrics), validating that our selection procedure effectively identifies trajectories with low RSR for each problem. C.4.4. Additional Trajectory Selection Experiments with Fewer Teacher Models To better reflect practical scenarios in which only few teachers trajectories are available and generally suitable teachers may be absent, we conduct additional experiments that select trajectories from reduced set of teachers. Specifically, we select trajectories from candidates generated by seven teachers: DeepSeek-R1, Qwen-3-235B-Thinking, NemotronSuper, Qwen-3-30B-Thinking, Magistral-Small, GPTOSS-20B, and Qwen-3-8B.

We also observe that the performance gap narrows when selecting from seven teachers compared with eleven teachers, which is expected and suggests that larger candidate space enables trajectory selection to more effectively identify high-quality training data. Moreover, Table 16 presents the data composition of datasets selected by RSR from the reduced set of seven teacher models. The distributions differ markedly for Qwen-3-14B and Qwen-2.5-7B: the former student model tends to favor teachers such as DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3-30B, whereas the latter student model shows stronger preference for smaller models such as Qwen-3-8B. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness of RSR in selecting teacher trajectories that are well suited to specific student models. D. Others D.1.

            "content": "You are meticulous and highly critical evaluator of AI reasoning. Your primary goal is to identify and quantify subtle flaws, logical gaps, inefficiencies, and hidden assumptions. Do not default to high score. Your starting assumption should be critical, and you must rigorously justify every point awarded. First, please carefully read the following problem statement: <Problem> {question} </Problem> Now, please carefully read the following candidates chain-of-thought reasoning: <Reasoning> {reasoning_to_evaluate} </Reasoning> When evaluating this reasoning, you must adhere to the following five key evaluation criteria and the scoring rubric below. Scoring Guidelines and Calibration: You must use the full 0.0 to 1.0 scale. Scores should not be clustered at the top. Use this rubric to anchor your scores: 1.0 (Exceptional/Flawless): Reserved for reasoning that is not only correct but also elegant, insightful, and comprehensive. It is perfectly structured and leaves no room for doubt. This score should be exceedingly rare. 0.8 - 0.9 (Excellent but Imperfect): The core reasoning is valid and well-supported, but there may be very minor, superficial issues (e.g., trivial typo in formula that doesnt affect the outcome, slightly awkward phrasing). The conclusion is unaffected. 0.5 - 0.7 (Competent but Flawed): The reasoning is generally on the right track but contains noticeable and nontrivial flaws. Examples include: minor factual error, logical leap that requires the reader to fill in the blanks, an inefficient method where much simpler one exists, or partially incomplete answer. 0.2 - 0.4 (Poor): The reasoning contains fundamental flaws that largely invalidate the process or conclusion. Examples include: significant factual error, clear logical fallacy, misunderstanding of the core problem constraints. 0.0 - 0.1 (Unacceptable): The reasoning is completely incorrect, irrelevant, nonsensical, or makes no meaningful attempt to solve the problem. Crucial Instruction for High Scores: To combat score inflation, you must justify high scores with the same rigor as low scores. For any criterion where you assign score of 0.9 or 1.0, your justification must explicitly state what makes the reasoning exceptional and why it lacks even subtle flaws. Evaluation Criteria: Factual Accuracy: Scrutinize every claim, formula, and piece of domain knowledge. Is it precisely correct? Assess the application of problem constraints, paying close attention to edge cases and boundary conditions. Penalize any inaccuracy, no matter how small. Logical Rigor: Probe for hidden assumptions and unstated premises. Does each conclusion necessarily and unambiguously follow from the preceding steps? Identify any logical fallacies, contradictions, or jumps in reasoning. chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Solution Completeness: Does the reasoning address all parts of the problem statement exhaustively? Does it consider all possible cases, sub-problems, and nuances? An answer that is correct for one case but ignores others is incomplete. Reasoning Efficiency: Is this the most direct and economical path to the solution? Penalize any unnecessary complexity, redundant steps, or exploration of irrelevant tangents, even if they eventually lead to the correct answer. The cognitive effort should be proportionate to the problems complexity. Presentation Quality: How clearly is the reasoning communicated? Is the structure logical and easy to follow? Ambiguous language, poor organization, or confusing sequence of steps should be penalized. An observer should be able to verify the reasoning process without difficulty. For each of the five evaluation criteria, please give score from 0.0 to 1.0 (in 0.1 increments) and brief, clear justification for that score in the JSON structure. 25 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better?
