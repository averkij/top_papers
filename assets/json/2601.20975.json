Introduction The field of artificial intelligence is witnessing paradigm shift, marked by the rapid transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomous web agents designed to interact with dynamic and complex environments to achieve specific goals. This agentic revolution demands sophisticated capabilities like planning, memory management and tool use. As these systems are increasingly integrated into production-level workflows, tasked with everything from simple data retrieval to complex, multi-step research, the necessity for robust, realistic evaluation methodologies has become paramount. Effective benchmarks are crucial not only for measuring progress but for identifying critical failure modes in these open-ended domains. However, the development of agent capabilities is rapidly outpacing current evaluation methodologies, leading to significant evaluation bottleneck where existing benchmarks are either saturated or too contrived to represent real-world user needs. 1.1. The Prevailing Paradigm: Single-Answer Verification The previous evaluation methods such as TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), HaluEval (Li et al., 2023), and FELM (Chen et al., 2023), or precision benchmarks like SimpleQA (Haas et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2024a) have successfully established rigorous standards for factuality and single-answer retrieval tasks such as What is the capital of France?. This single-answer format was deliberate and highly effective strategy. It enabled low-cost, scalable, and objective automated grading, removing the subjectivity and expense associated with evaluating long-form, generative answersa massive challenge highlighted by recent Corresponding author(s): gnikita@google.com, lukhaas@google.com, dipanjand@google.com 2026 Google.

Profile Prompt The Epidemiologist Between 2019 and 2020, which states had death rate (the number of deaths per 100,000 total population) between 229.8 - < 268.1 that was inflicted by the leading cause of death in the US during 2019 and 2020 per the CDC? The Video Gamer love video games and Im doing bit of an analysis into some of the highest selling hardware.

Use Statistics Canada as the source for all data. work on hallucination and attribution (Rashkin et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2024). While researchers have developed metrics for long-form consistencysuch as FActScore (Bishop et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023), LongFact (Wei et al., 2024b), VERISCORE (Song et al., 2024), and FactAlign (Huang and Chen, 2024)these often require expensive human-in-the-loop verification or complex LLM-based judges (Liu et al., 2024; Ramprasad and Wallace, 2024). Similarly, claim verification frameworks like TRUE (Honovich et al., 2022), MiniCheck (Tang et al., 2024), and CoverBench (Jacovi et al., 2024) focus on grounding specific claims rather than evaluating the completeness of research trajectory. With the release of reasoning-intensive models (Anthropic, 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Gemini Team, Google, 2025; OpenAI, 2024, 2025c), agentic evaluation requires assessing the ability to reason over external information, formulate long-horizon plans, and synthesize findings from unstructured web sources. Previous attempts to address this, such as Humanitys Last Exam (HLE) (Phan et al., 2025), GAIA (Mialon et al., 2023), and OpenAIs BrowseComp (Wei et al., 2025), have pushed the difficulty cieling by introducing expert-level questions that resist simple retrieval. However, even these advanced benchmarks largely retain the single-answer format to ensure objective scoring. Even benchmarks designed for dynamic or search-augmented settings, such as FreshLLMs (Vu et al., 2023) and RealTime QA (Kasai et al., 2024), often rely on atomic answers that do not capture the complexity of broad information gathering. This single-answer paradigm was valuable scaffold, isolating core competencies like navigation and search strategy (Miroyan et al., 2025). However, it incentivizes precision-first distinct search trajectories finding the needle in the haystackrather than the recall-oriented exhaustive research required in many real-life user information-seeking journeys (Du et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2025a). 1.2. The Comprehensiveness Gap: Beyond Finding an Answer The limitation of the single-answer approach reveals what we term the Comprehensiveness Gap in current agent evaluation. Many real-world information-seeking tasks are not satisfied by retrieving single data point, as seen in traditional datasets like Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), or HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018). Instead, they require more complex research tasks such as List all companies in the semiconductor sector with P/E ratio under 20 and presence in Southeast Asia. or Identify all clinical trials for mRNA vaccines initiated in 2024. 2 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents Figure 1 DeepSearchQA benchmark overview. The benchmark features balanced distribution of prompts across diverse topics (Left), preventing domain overfitting. When evaluated on this diverse set, the Gemini Deep Research agent demonstrates strong performance scaling (Right), with accuracy increasing monotonically as more test-time compute (samples) is applied. This shift from simple retrieval to agentic information retrieval (Zhang et al., 2024) necessitates fundamentally different cognitive profile. It requires three higher-order capabilities that existing benchmarks fail to isolate: 1. First, the agents must demonstrate Systematic Collation, the ability to visit disparate sources often hundreds and collate master list where no single source contains the comprehensive information. Recent work on unified retrieval evaluation, such as Fact-Fetch-Reason (Krishna et al., 2025) and MoNaCo (Wolfson et al., 2025) begin to address the agentic nature of information retrieval, but lacks the exhaustive scope required here. 2. Second, agents must perform Entity Resolution (De-duplication). This is the ability to identify when two retrieved entities are identical despite varying surface forms complex task in structured reasoning (Li et al., 2024) often overlooked in implicit reasoning benchmarks (Geva et al., 2021). In deep research context, failure to resolve entities leads to inflated lists and degraded precision, common failure mode we observe in our experiments. 3. Third, and perhaps most critically, agents must reason about Stopping Criteria under epistemic uncertainty. The agent must determine when search is complete without an explicit termination signal (Yang et al., 2024). This challenges the agent to distinguish between absence of evidence (I have not found it yet.) and evidence of absence (It does not exist.). 1.3. DeepSearchQA Core Contributions The primary contribution of DeepSearchQA is to shift the evaluation paradigm from precision-based retrieval to exhaustive answer set generation. The benchmark requires agents to conduct deep, autonomous browsing operations to generate complete, verifiable set of all possible answers for given query, rather than single data point. In line with the principles of simplicity and verifiability espoused by SimpleQA (Haas et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2024a), Facts (Cheng et al., 2025), and BrowseComp (Wei et al., 2025), DeepSearchQA employs strictly outcome-based evaluation methodology. Performance is judged solely on the completeness (recall) and correctness (precision) of the final set submitted by the agent, rather than the search trajectory used to obtain it. This approach encourages architectural diversity while serving as rigorous functional test. To achieve high F1 score, an agent is effectively forced to master the trade-off between exploration (casting wide net) and exploitation (verifying candidates), navigating the open web without predefined map. We will maintain live DeepSearchQA leaderboard tracking performance of different models. The leaderboard will remain open to new model submissions. Evaluation will be done by Kaggle. 3 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents Task Complexity Subtypes Easy Example Hard Example Structured Retrieval (The \"Search\") Multi-step search strategy, Obscure info Linear Fact Retrieval What is the capital of France?

The last two columns compare easy against hard versions of the same examples. 2. DeepSearchQA: Dataset and Taxonomy The DeepSearchQA dataset comprises diverse set of questions curated by expert data annotators from various sources to reflect realistic, high value user queries. These were rigorously filtered to focus on objective, information-seeking tasks where the ground truth is definitive. Dataset Statistics and Domains. The benchmark contains 900 prompts paired with ground-truth answer sets. The questions span broad distribution of domainsincluding Politics and Government, Finance and Economics, Science, Health, History, Geography, and Mediaensuring that agents are tested on their ability to generalize across varying web structures and content types. Figure 1 presents the distribution of the domains in the dataset and Table 1 shows different examples from our curated dataset. critical design choice was to ensure that all prompts are time-anchored or reference static data sources (e.g., According to the 2020 Census...). This minimizes the drift inherent in live web benchmarks, where the ground truth changes over time. Answer Types. The ground-truth answer space is categorized into two distinct types: Single Answer: The answer is unique entity or value (e.g., specific date or name). While similar to traditional QA, these require deep research due to the obscurity of the requested data and possible conflicting evidences on the web. Set Answer: The answer is collection of items. This includes Enumeration (listing all items matching constraint) and Composite responses (answering multiple sub-questions). Quality Verification Protocol. To ensure ground truth accuracy, we implemented standardized three-phase verification protocol. The process included 1) Independent Research Phase, where three 4 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents Full Prompt Task Complexity Relocation Planner Im looking to move house to new city.

This was followed by 2) Verification and Comparison, where the independent answer was cross-referenced with the original ground-truth answer given by the prompt curator. Any discrepancies triggered final 3) Conflict Resolution Phase, to determine if the original ground-truth answer required updating, the reviewer was incorrect, or the prompt itself was ambiguously flawed. All ambiguous prompts were filtered at this stage. Task Complexity Taxonomy. We categorize tasks based on the cognitive and operative demands they place on the agent. This taxonomy helps diagnose specific weaknesses in agent architectures. Structured Retrieval (The Search): This requires devising multi-step search strategies to retrieve obscure, niche information to fulfill the user need. Context Management (The Assembly): This involves ingesting and synthesizing large volumes of information of potentially different formats, where the key challenge is about effectively managing context window limitations. Logical Reasoning (The Thinker): This requires abstract deduction, planning, conflict resolution, and infer latent information from incomplete data. Table 2 shows one example for each of the tasks and illustrates the difference between easy examples from previous benchmarks compared to hard examples which we include in our benchmark and Table 3 illustrates the required reasoning to solve prompts from our new benchmark. 5 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents 3. Evaluation Methodology The evaluation of DeepSearchQA requires methodology that can robustly and fairly assess the quality of set-based answer format, where the order of items is irrelevant and semantic variations in answers are common. 3.1. Formal Evaluation Metrics To formally evaluate performance, we adopt standard metrics from the field of information retrieval as well as introduce several categorical metrics. In the following definitions, let 𝑆𝑖 be the set of distinct answers submitted by the agent for given prompt 𝑖, and 𝐺𝑖 be the ground-truth set of correct answers for that prompt. We utilize two-tiered evaluation approach: Continuous Metrics for granular performance analysis, and Categorical Classification for strict success rates. Continuous Metrics. We report standard retrieval metrics to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and exhaustiveness. These metrics are calculated for each individual prompt and then averaged over the entire evaluation set. F1-Score (𝐹1) serves as the primary ranking metric, providing balanced measure of performance by calculating the harmonic mean of Precision (𝑃) and Recall (𝑅). For specific prompt 𝑖: 𝐹1,𝑖 = 2 𝑃𝑖 𝑅𝑖 𝑃𝑖 + 𝑅𝑖 Here, precision (𝑃𝑖 = 𝑆𝑖𝐺𝑖 measures the exhaustiveness of the submission against the ground truth. 𝑆𝑖 ) represents the accuracy of the submitted items, while Recall (𝑅𝑖 = 𝑆𝑖𝐺𝑖 𝐺𝑖 ) For single-answer tasks: The F1 score is equivalent to exact match accuracy (binary 1.0 or 0.0). For set-answer tasks: The F1 score ensures performance reflects both completeness and accuracy. This metric strictly penalizes agents that attempt to maximize recall by simply outputting large number of guesses (hallucinations or drift). Categorical Classification. We also report strict, binary categorizations of each response into one of four disjoint categories based on the set relationship between 𝑆𝑖 and 𝐺𝑖: 1. Fully Correct (𝑆𝑖 = 𝐺𝑖): response is fully correct if and only if the submitted set is semantically identical to the ground-truth set. The agent must identify all correct answers while including zero incorrect answers. Single-answer tasks: The agent provides the exact, unique golden entity required. Set-answer tasks: The agent retrieves the complete, exhaustive list of items (𝑅𝑖 = 1.0) without hallucinating any extra items (𝑃𝑖 = 1.0). 2. Fully Incorrect (𝑆𝑖 𝐺𝑖 = ): response is fully incorrect if the submitted set contains zero correct items. The intersection between the submitted answer and the ground truth is empty. Single-answer tasks: The agent provides wrong answer or claims no answer exists. Set-answer tasks: The agent fails to retrieve even single valid item from the ground truth answer set. This suggests complete failure of the search strategy or fundamental misunderstanding of the prompt. 3. Partially Correct ( (𝑆𝑖 𝐺𝑖) 𝐺𝑖): response is partially correct, if it contains some but not all correct answers and potentially some not contained by the ground truth. This error mode only exists for set-answer tasks. 6 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents 4. Correct with Extraneous Answers (𝐺𝑖 𝑆𝑖): response falls into this category if the agent successfully identifies all items from the ground-truth answer set (𝑅𝑖 = 1.0) but also includes one or more incorrect items (𝑃𝑖 < 1.0). This represents the hedging failure mode. Single-answer tasks: This is treated as failure. Providing multiple candidates when unique entity is required implies failure to disambiguate. Example (Conflict Avoidance): Q: Who won the 1994 World Cup? (GT: Brazil) Agent: Brazil and Italy. The agent lists both the winner and runner-up rather than committing to one. Example (Popularity Bias): Q: What is the capital of Australia? (GT: Canberra) Agent: Canberra or Sydney. The agent includes the most famous city alongside the actual capital to mitigate the risk of user error. Set-answer tasks: The agent identifies all correct items (𝑅𝑖 = 1.0) but fails the stopping criteria, effectively guessing extra items. Example (Classification Drift): Q: List the planets in the Solar System. Agent includes Pluto alongside the correct eight. Example (Association): Q: Which US states border Maine? Agent: New Hampshire and Vermont. The agent hallucinates items that are semantically or geographically close to the target. 3.2. Automated Evaluation Pipeline We employ an automated LLM-as-a-Judge pipeline to determine the semantic equivalence of extracted answers. For every item 𝑠 𝑆𝑖, the judge determines if 𝑠 is semantically equivalent to any item 𝑔 𝐺𝑖. For evaluation purposes, we use Gemini 2.5 Flash (Gemini Team, Google, 2025) in zero-shot setting using the prompt provided in Section A. 4. Results and Analysis Table 4 presents the comprehensive evaluation performance on suite of state-of-the-art Deep Research agents and reasoning models. The results highlight the scaling behavior of agentic capability and the persistent difficulty of the Comprehensiveness Gap. We report four primary indicators: the percentage of Fully Correct responses (𝑆 = 𝐺, where the model retrieved the exact ground-truth set), Fully Incorrect responses (𝑆 𝐺 = , where no relevant items were found), and the aggregate F1-Score, which balances precision and recall. We also report Correct with Extraneous Answers where models retrieve the correct answer but fail to filter out non-relevant items. State-of-the-Art in Deep Research. Gemini Deep Research Agent and GPT-5 Pro High Reasoning (OpenAI, 2025b) establish the state-of-the-art on this benchmark, although Gemini Deep Research Agent likely does so more efficiently, judging by the significantly lower cost1. The results reveal clear hierarchy: Deep Research Agents outperform their standalone reasoning model counterparts. This confirms that while reasoning models provide the raw intelligence, the iterative loop of an agent is required to close the Comprehensiveness Gap. Notably, GPT-5 Pro High Reasoning and Gemini Deep Research Agent exhibit different performance profiles. While both have statistically comparable fully correct rates (66.09% vs 65.18%), the Gemini Deep Research Agent minimizes catastrophic failures more effectively, achieving the lowest Fully Incorrect rate of 9.95% vs 14.13% for GPT-5 Pro high reasoning. Table 5 illustrates common failure modes exhibited by the top-performing models. Notably, these failures manifest at distinct stages of the information processing pipeline. In the first instance, the Gemini Deep Research Agent successfully 1Gemini Deep Research Agent pricing vs. GPT-5 Pro pricing. 7 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents Table 4 Main results on DeepSearchQA, independently evaluated by Kaggle.

In the second, GPT-5 Pro High Reasoning encounters an unreadable document and fails to recover, effectively halting the process. Finally, the third example demonstrates constraint violation, where the model fails to filter data points according to the prompts requirements, indicating breakdown in the agents stopping criteria. The mid-tier consists of o3 Deep Research (Fully Correct: 44.24%) and o4 Mini Deep Research (Fully Correct: 40.36%). Their Fully Incorrect rates rise to 20.09% and 24.19% respectively, showing rapid degradation in the ability to maintain coherent long-horizon search strategies. Scaling Behavior and the Reasoning Threshold. The F1-Score and Fully Incorrect metrics highlight hard reasoning threshold required for autonomous research. While the gap between the top models is narrow, there is precipitate drop-off for smaller reasoning models. Gemini 2.5 Flash, drops to an 𝐹1 of 42.99%, roughly half that of the leader. More critically, the Fully Incorrect rate spikes to 45.27%nearly five times the failure rate of the SOTA agent. This confirms that DeepSearchQA tasks are intractable via simple semantic search; they require structured retrieval and multi-step reasoning. Below certain parameter or compute threshold, agents suffer from trajectory divergence, pursuing entirely incorrect search paths that yield zero relevant results. This finding suggests that scaling down to cheaper model for research tasks is not linear trade-off: it is step-function drop in utility. On the other side of the spectrum, we can observe that by allocating more test-time compute and sampling 𝑛 times, we can increase the Fully Correct rate from 67.18% (𝑛 = 1) to 85.71% (𝑛 = 8). Even sampling only twice yields 74.51%, and with 𝑛 = 4, we can already achieve 81.72%. Metric Divergence: The Last Mile Problem. We observe distinct divergence between the granular F1-Score and strict Fully Correct (𝑆 = 𝐺) success rates. For instance, while the Gemini Deep Research Agent achieves an F1-Score of 81.90%, its strict success rate is 66.09%. This roughly 15-point gap represents the Last Mile Problem in autonomous deep research. For GPT-5 Pro High Reasoning, the gap is around 13 points. This is driven by two opposing failure modes: under-retrieval, where the agent finds the majority of items but misses the long tail of obscure entities; and over-retrieval, where the agent achieves perfect recall (𝑅 = 1.0) but fails to recognize when the search is complete, hallucinating extra items or drifting into adjacent topics. This gap validates the necessity of strict set-based metrics for agent evaluation because high recall is insufficient if the agent lacks the discernment to filter noise. 8 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents Full Prompt Failure Mode Model Response Snippet Which EU country, that does not touch the Mediterranean Sea, had the least annual transport of goods through air, sea, inland waterway, rail, and road by thousand tonnes according to Eurostat in 2022 where every transit method actually had an amount of transported goods.

Future Work 5.1. Limitations While DeepSearchQA offers robust framework for evaluating comprehensive retrieval, it relies on specific design choices that entail certain limitations. By employing an exclusively outcome-based evaluation, we effectively treat the agent as black box. In the absence of trajectory data, it is difficult to distinguish between an agent that reasoned correctly and one that arrived at the correct list through inefficient or accidental means (e.g., lucky guessing). Additionally, the Static Web Assumption, while necessary for reproducibility, limits the evaluation of breaking news retrieval where ground truth is volatile. tasks ground truth may become outdated if source websites are removed or their content is significantly altered. This is prevalent challenge for all benchmarks operating on the live web, necessitating periodic manual reviews and updates to the dataset. 5.2. Methodological Extensions The DeepSearchQA benchmark provides foundation that can be extended in several promising directions: 9 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents Incorporating Process-Based Metrics: Future iterations of the benchmark could categorize agent trajectories (e.g., pages visited, query sequences). While scoring would remain outcome-based, this auxiliary data would provide diagnostic insights into failure modes, helping researchers differentiate between retrieval failures, reasoning errors, and synthesis issues. Dynamic and Time-Sensitive Lists: To test real-time information retrieval, future versions could introduce live questions where the ground truth is volatile (e.g., List all current members of the UK Parliaments Science and Technology Committee). This would evaluate an agents ability to handle temporal constraints and fetch fresh data. Weighted Relevance Scoring: While the current benchmark treats all ground-truth items with equal weight, future extensions could implement graded relevance. By distinguishing between core and peripheral answers, the framework can leverage rank-aware metrics such as normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nCDG) (Järvelin and Kekäläinen, 2002). 5.3. Implications for Advancements in Agent Architecture By explicitly rewarding exhaustive retrieval, we expect DeepSearchQA to catalyze research for agents that possess new set of sophisticated skills. High performance on this benchmark will likely require: Systematic Exploration Strategies: Agents must move beyond opportunistic keyword searching toward methodical exploration strategies (e.g., tree-based or graph-based navigation) to ensure that no relevant sub-pages or sections are overlooked. Advanced Information Synthesis: As agents gather candidates from heterogeneous sources, they require robust mechanisms to merge information, resolve entity ambiguities, and deduplicate semantically equivalent answers to form clean final list. Dynamic Stopping Criteria: Perhaps the most critical capability is the ability to reason about search completeness. Agents must develop stopping criterion to dynamically determine when the retrieved set is likely exhaustive and further searching would be unproductivea significant step forward in agentic reasoning. 6. Conclusion The rapid advancement of LLM-based agents necessitates corresponding evolution in the methodologies used to evaluate them. While existing benchmarks like Humanitys Last Exam and BrowseComp have been instrumental in pushing the frontiers of agentic reasoning and information discovery, the Comprehensiveness Gap remains critical blind spot. DeepSearchQA addresses this by providing rigorous, set-based evaluation framework that penalizes both under-retrieval and hedging. DeepSearchQA directly measures the skills of systematic exploration, multi-source synthesis, and search completioncompetencies that are vital for many real-world research and analysis tasks. The benchmarks outcome-based evaluation protocol, grounded in the established information retrieval metrics of Precision, Recall, and F1-score, provides robust and flexible framework for assessing performance without constraining architectural innovation. Our evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models, such as GPT-5 Pro and Gemini Deep Research Agent, struggle to balance the trade-off between recall and precision. By creating clear, measurable target for exhaustive retrieval, DeepSearchQA aims to catalyze the next phase of agent developmentmoving from agents that can answer question to agents that can master topic and mapping an information landscape. Optimizing for this deeper level of comprehensiveness is the critical next step toward building genuinely capable and reliable autonomous web agents. 10 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents 7.

Judge Prompt Templates Grader Prompt Your task is to evaluate whether given \"AI Response\" for specific \"User Prompt\" arrived at the correct answer. **Answer Correctness Task** **Purpose:** Assess whether the AI response provides the correct answer(s) based on * the provided \"Correct Answer\" and \"Prompt Type\". * Identify the \"Prompt Type\": \"<prompt_type>\". Refer to the \"Correct Answer\": \"<answer>\". Based on the \"Prompt Type\", determine if the \"AI Response\" contains the expected **Process:** * * * answer(s). * **Single Answer**: Check if the response provides the answer that addresses the users question. It does not have to match the exact wording of the provided answer. * **Set Answer**: Check if the response includes *each* item from the provided ground truth answers. The order might not matter unless specified otherwise. The response might include more answers than the list. Determine the correctness * only* based on the list first and then check if the response includes answers not in the list. * **Explanation:** Provide brief explanation justifying your assessment of answer correctness, referencing specific parts of the AI response and the correct answer. **Correctness Details:** Provide dictionary, one key for each expected answer * part, and value is boolean indicating whether each expected answer part was found. * For Set Answer, this will be list of attributes, one for each item/part in the \"Correct Answer\". Each key will be string indicating the expected answer part, and the value will be boolean indicating whether that part was found in the response. * **Excessive Answers:** Provide list of strings, each indicating an excessive answer part. If the response provides answers that are **not** in the \"Correct Answer \" list, add these answers as excessive answers. Return an empty list when theres no excessive answers in the response. **Output Format:** Your evaluation *must* be structured as nested JSON dictionary with the following toplevel keys: \"Answer Correctness\". Please return NULL if any of \"Prompt\", \"AI Response\" or \"Correct Answer\" is empty. The value for \"Answer Correctness\" should be dictionary containing \"Explanation\" ( string), \"Correctness Details\" (a dictionary where each key is the expected correct answer, and the value is boolean indicating whether the response contains the correct answer), and \"Excessive Answers\" (a list of strings indicating the excessive answers). Make sure you return valid JSON string. Pay special attention to quotes, commas and special characters in the JSON string. Make sure to escape all special characters and quotes in the JSON string. 15 DeepSearchQA : Bridging the Comprehensiveness Gap for Deep Research Agents Grader Partial Output Example **Example (Partial):** \"json {{ \"Answer Correctness\": {{ \"Explanation\": \"The response correctly identified Belgium and France but also includes an excessive answer, Italy.\", \"Correctness Details\": {{ \"Belgium\": true, \"France\": true, }}, \"Excessive Answers\": [ \"Italy\" ] }} }} \" **Now, proceed with the evaluation using the provided User Prompt, AI Response, and Correct Answer.** User Prompt (Wrapped in <prompt> and </prompt>): <prompt> {prompt} </prompt> -------------------- ** Correct Answer (Wrapped in <answer> and </answer>): Prompt Type: {prompt_type} <answer> {answer} </answer> -------------------- AI assistant response (Wrapped in <response> and </response>): <response> {response} </response> -------------------- Rating:"
