Figure 1: Two main challenges we address with our approach: (a) Bridging the semantic gap between short-form segment descriptions and hour-long video summaries descriptions (b) Overcoming the domain shift between the source domain and the target domain. videos, short-form video models are only able to produce descriptions for short segments of video that represent isolated actions without capturing the underlying story, resulting in extraneous details [13, 19]. For example, model may capture individual actions in biographical film, but it will struggle to summarise the significant events of persons life. To extend the capabilities of video captioning to longer durations, MA-LMM [9] and LaViLa [61] use LLMs to describe long-form videos with duration up to 10 minutes. These models still struggle with the extensive content of hour-long videos, for which there is notable lack of suitable training datasets. Addressing this gap, Ego4D [8] introduced the first extensive hour-long video dataset; however, these videos are mostly first-person, and they differ from the typical third-person videos (e.g., vlogs, documentaries, etc), which may limit their broader use in video understanding tasks. To better summarise hour-long videos, the authors of Video Recap [13] Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Jian et al. Figure 2: Motivation of our VisMaP. Most existing video summarisation models focus on minute-level short-form videos, while hour-long videos, which are more common in real-world scenarios, are often overlooked due to their length, content complexity, and the prohibitively high cost of manual annotation. We propose cross-domain unsupervised approach for hour-long video summarisation. It leverages the inductive power of multiple LLMs to generate high-quality pseudo-summaries from short video segments via meta-prompting. These pseudo-summaries are then used to train model, enabling effective summarisation of long videos without costly human annotations. introduced recursive video captioning model trained on an hourlong video dataset with multi-granularity annotations. It identifies key moments from redundant information to generate effective summaries. However, annotating hour-long videos at multiple levels of granularity is not only costly but also prone to annotator inconsistencies [13]; this creates the need for careful quality control of the annotations, which imposes additional cost and scaling constraints. In contrast, extensive collections of annotated short-form videos are readily available for training models. In this work, we propose scalable approach to generate unsupervised hour-long video summaries. Our aim is to train lightweight summarisation model from annotated short-form videos in source domain, and then generalise to unannotated hour-long videos in target domain. For this purpose, we develop methods to transition from recognising single actions in short videos and summarising the more complex activities in unannotated hour-long videos (See Fig.2). There are three main challenges in understanding complex behaviours in hour-long videos from their associated atomic actions. The first challenge is identifying the salient atomic actions within large collection of redundant information. The second is bridging the semantic gap between atomic actions in short-form segments and their corresponding complex behaviour within long videos (see Fig. 1a). complex behaviour may consist of many atomic actions (where order may also matter) that collectively identify the behaviour, thus certain level of reasoning is required to bridge the semantic gap between those atomic actions and the complex behaviour. Finally, we also address the semantic gap the may exist between the source and target domains due to differences in the content, as is the case for instance between the Ego4D-HCap and Youcook2 datasets (see Fig. 1b). To address these challenges we introduce Video Summarisation by Meta Prompting (VisMaP). An overview of the framework is shown in Fig. 3, and consists of three stages: First, we use minutelong annotated videos as the source domain to construct lightweight short-form video summary model. Second, we treat unsupervised hour-long videos as the target domain and split them into minute-long segments to reduce the semantic gap caused by video length. We then use the summary model from Stage 1 to generate pseudo-captions for these segments transfering the visual information into the text domain. After that, we use these pseudo-captions along with meta-prompting to construct optimised pseudo-summaries (i.e., summaries of long videos generated without human intervention) for hour-long target domain videos. Using the contextual reasoning and reflection capabilities of LLMs, our method iteratively discovers and selects relevant semantic tokens associated with atomic activities in the source domain and complex activities in the target domain, aiming to construct optimised pseudo-summaries. Finally, the third challenge is to fine-tune the foundational model from Stage 1 to generate hour-long video summaries from minute-long segment pseudo-captions, using the optimised pseudo-summaries as supervision. We evaluate the performance of VisMaP on five datasets, and we provide theoretical results showing that VisMaP reduces the error upper bound due to the domain gap caused by both video length and semantic distribution. Our contributions are the following: To our knowledge, we are the first to present and address the challenge of unsupervised hour-long video summary. We formulate mechanism to extend video understanding from annotated short-form videos to unlabelled hour-long ones. We do this by optimising semantic alignment, and bridging the gap caused by longer video lengths and semantic distribution. Specifically, we present meta-prompting, using LLMs to optimise the selection and localisation of key events in hour-long videos. With pseudo captions from models trained on short-form videos, our approach uses sequences of atomic action descriptions to iteratively obtain more accurate holistic summaries of hour-long videos. We conduct experiments on five datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ViSMaP. These experiments show that we can attain comparable performance to fully supervised state of the art models, in an unsupervised and, importantly, domain adaptable manner.

VisMaP sidesteps\nthis challenge by requiring only short-form video annotations and\nadapting them to long-form videos.\nShort-form video models typically process videos under 3 min-\nutes and include tasks like: a) Video Question Answering [24, 51],\nwhich answers questions based on an understanding of the entire\nvideo clip; b) video captioning [12, 43] goes further, requiring more\ndetailed descriptions for different clips of a video; c) video ground-\ning [54, 60] locates the temporal moments in a video that correspond\nto a given text description. These tasks only require temporal or\nspatial localisation and understanding; hour-long video summarisa-\ntion, on the other hand, is more complex because it needs to identify\ncrucial frames within a vast amount of redundant information and\nto comprehend them.\nLong-form Video Models normally handle videos between 3 and\n10 minutes; for example, Refs.

            "content": "models struggle with hour-long videos because identifying sporadically dispersed important moments among extensive information is difficult for them. LongVA [58] and LLaVA-Video [59] are capable of performing VQA on hour-long videos, but they require largescale annotated long video datasets for training and attain limited performance on video summarisation tasks. Video ReCap [13] uses recursive supervised training for hour-long first-person videos to identify important moments and create summaries, but requires extensive annotations and struggles with videos in third-person perspective. VisMaP avoids these problems by relying on metaprompting to perform spatio-temporal modelling, and generate summaries from redundant information in long videos. Domain Adaptation (DA) transfers useful information from labelled source domain to an unlabelled target domain [31]. For example, conventional DA approaches require simultaneous access to both source and target domain data during training, and typically rely on adversarial learning [11, 41] or high-order moment matching [32, 62]. In contrast, source-free DA methods only need model previously trained on the source domain for target adaptation [17, 25]; VisMaP falls into this category. While previous work focus mostly on classification and segmentation, VisMaP is the first to our knowledge that applies DA methods to generate unsupervised hour-long video summaries. Furthermore, VisMaP not only identifies target atomic activities in source domains (with domain gaps), but also discovers undefined new complex activities."

Our working assumption is that in hour-long videos, only few key segments are relevant to the underlying narrative and identifying these segments from all the redundant information is particularly challenging task.

In addition, the optimal prompt is unknown, and may even differ between models, model versions or even across different videos.

We use the annotated minute-length video segments as\nthe source domain D𝑠 and the unlabelled full videos as the target\ndomain D𝑡 We compare VisMaP with Video ReCaP [13], the only\nmodel specifically designed for hour-long video summaries, and\nLaViLa [61], a video captioning model that can be extended for\nlong-form videos, both of which were trained on the Ego4D-HCap\ndataset. The Video Recap model uses additional 4-second video clips\nfor training. We also compare VisMaP against zero-shot approaches\nusing BLIP2 [21] combined with GPT 3.5 [35] and LaViLa with GPT\n3.5.

We compared VisMaP with leading methods [29, 36, 47, 53] to highlight its adaptability and performance across various video formats and topical complexities. Metrics. To measure performance across all tests, we rely on three widely-used captioning metrics: CIDEr (C) [42], which quantifies the similarity between candidates captions and reference captions based on the consensus of 𝑛-grams; ROUGE-L (R) [27], which measures the longest common subsequence between the generated text and the reference to assess fluency and text coherence; and METEOR (M) [3], which evaluates translation hypotheses by aligning them to reference translations based on their semantic and syntactic features. For the EgoSchema dataset, we use QA-accuracy to evaluate on the VQA task. Higher scores on these metrics indicate better performance. Implementation Details. Our model is trained on one NVIDIA A100 GPU for 25 epochs during each of the two phases. frozen TimeSformer [5] is used as an encoder to generate video embeddings. DistilBERT [39], language model, aligns video embeddings with text inputs. We aggregate the 4-second embeddings from TimeSFormer to form fixed-length embedding for various video lengths. GPT2 text decoder is used for the final output. We used the Adam optimiser [7] with learning rate of 3e-5 and weight decay of 0.01. We used GPT 3.5 Turbo as the optimiser and generator, Gemini 1.5 Flash as the evaluator, with 5 cycles meta-prompting to generate pseudo-summary (see Fig. 3).

Figure 4: An example of summaries from ViSMaP on the Ego4D-HCap dataset. generalise going from hour-long videos to short videos. VisMaP significantly outperforms long-form video methods and classical approaches, further proving its superior performance and generalisation ability across various video analysis tasks. The consistent strong performance across datasets highlights our methods robustness and adaptability to diverse videos and tasks. Results on short video captioning. Tab. 3 shows short video captioning evaluation on the MSRVTT, MSVD, and YouCook2 datasets. We pit unsupervised VisMaP against supervised learning approaches. Results show that VisMaP can effectively caption short videos with significant differences in perspective and content, and achieves results that are close to or even surpass supervised models. Qualitative Results on the Ego4D-HCap dataset. Fig. 4 shows an example of the type of summaries that VisMap can generate without supervision on 63 minute long video from the Ego4DHCap dataset. Following the flow in Fig. 3, the source summary model, which was trained on short-form videos, produces captions for each 30-second long segment. The collection of segment descriptions for this video has total of 3480 words. After adaptation, the target model, which is adjusted to content variations, selects the key information (shown in red boxes in the figure) to create an accurate and concise summary that is specific to the input video (third row in Fig. 4), which in this example is 19 words long. These summaries can be readily compared to ground truth summaries generated by human annotators (bottom row in Fig. 4). Module Analysis. To understand the contribution of the constituent components of our method to its performance we carry out an ablation study. The first row of Tab. 4 contains basic baseline approach that uses model pretrained on the source domain, and employs GPT-3.5 to create summaries. We use these summaries as pseudo-labels to train new captioning model. This baseline, similar to LLoVi [55], is less effective because it cannot accurately identify key information, resulting in summaries filled with unnecessary details. Row 2 contains model enhanced by incorporating source contrastive learning during pre-training, which enables the extraction of information from the source domain, and improves the accuracy of the target pseudo-summaries. Rows 3 and 4 contain models that introduce cycle summary and prompt generation strategies, respectively. These techniques use meta-learning to iteratively improve summaries and prompts, leading to more accurate pseudo-summaries and validating our meta-prompting approach. Finally, row 5 adds the SCE loss during target adaptation to reduce the impact of noisy labels and ensure effective semantic learning. Analysis of the number of iterations. In Tab. 5, we present an evaluation of the impact that the number of iterations 𝐾 has on performance. These results clearly show the benefit from each iteration up to the fifth, after which it stabilises. Therefore, we have set 𝐾 = 5 in our evaluations. LLMs in meta prompting. To understand which combination of LLMs as optimiser, evaluator and generator works best, we evaluate different combinations and report our results in Tab. 7. The results reveal that different LLM choices significantly impact performance. While GPT-4 demonstrates strong overall capabilities, it does not consistently outperform all configurations. Notably, the combination of GPT-3.5 as both the optimiser and generator, with Gemini as the evaluator, achieves the highest scores across all metrics, suggesting that Gemini provides effective evaluation feedback while GPT-3.5 generates outputs that align well with the evaluation criteria. In contrast, Mixtral-based setups generally yield lower performance, indicating that its effectiveness may be role-dependent. These findings highlight the importance of selecting LLMs based on their specific strengths rather than defaulting to single powerful model for all tasks. Supplementary material Sections S1 and S2 provide code information and implementation details. Section S3 presents an in-depth theoretical analysis, Sections S4 and S5 contain an analysis of the LLMs in meta-prompting and detailed limitations."

            "title": "6 Conclusion\nWe introduce ViSMaP, an unsupervised method for summarising\nhour-long videos by leveraging annotated short-video datasets and\na meta-prompting strategy. We first generate high-quality sum-\nmaries via meta-prompting and then train an end-to-end summari-\nsation model, reducing reliance on extensive annotations. Exper-\niments show ViSMaP achieves performance comparable to fully\nsupervised methods and adapts effectively to diverse video datasets.\nOne limitation of ViSMaP is that it relies on pseudo labels generated\nby a source-domain model, which may limit performance under\nlarge domain shifts. The current approach also uses only visual\ninformation, without incorporating audio or transcripts, which can\naffect summary quality. TFuture work can explore multimodal in-\nputs, hierarchical summarisation at different resolutions, and more\ngeneralisable meta-prompting methods for broader use.",

Supplementary Materials for ViSMaP: Unsupervised Hour-long Video Summary by Meta-Prompting Jian Hu1,2* Dimitrios Korkinof2 1Queen Mary University of London Shaogang Gong1 Mariano Beguerisse-Díaz2 2Spotify jian.hu@qmul.ac.uk, dkorkinof@spotify.com, s.gong@qmul.ac.uk, marianob@spotify.com Abstract We introduce ViSMap: Unsupervised Video Summarisation by Meta Prompting, system to summarise hour long videos with nosupervision. Most existing video understanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet they struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely distributed and not pre-segmented. Moreover, long-form video understanding often relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive annotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency. With ViSMaP we bridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and long ones (where its not). We rely on LLMs to create optimised pseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones. These pseudo-summaries are used as training data for model that generates long-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long videos. Specifically, we adopt meta-prompting strategy to iteratively generate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. The strategy leverages short clip descriptions obtained from supervised short video model to guide the summary. Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one to generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it, and third to optimise the prompt of the generator. This iteration is necessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on the generator prompt, and varies widely among videos. We evaluate our summaries extensively on multiple datasets; our results show that ViSMaP achieves performance comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art models while generalising across domains without sacrificing performance. Code will be released upon publication.

Specifi-\ncally, the feature encoder is a TimeSformer, which processes videos\nresized to 224x224 pixels. This encoder inherits parameters from a\nmodel pre-trained as detailed in [61]. During training, the visual\nencoder remains frozen, and we use the output from the final cls\nlayer as the input for our visual language alignment module. In our\nVideo-Language (VL) Alignment module, we employ DistilBERT, a\npretrained 6-layer transformer encoder model. We maintain the self-\nattention blocks as frozen and introduce a trainable cross-attention\nmodule to each layer. The model processes video features from\nthe video encoder and captions produced in the preceding hier-\narchy as inputs. We employ a pretrained GPT2 model as a text\ndecoder, featuring a 12-layer transformer structure. Within each\ntransformer layer, we incorporate a gated cross-attention block,\ntraining only these blocks while freezing the remaining components.\nEach block comprises a cross-attention layer and a feed-forward\nlayer, enhanced by tanh gating initially set to zero.\nTraining details. The training of VisMaP involves three phases.\nThe first phase trains on supervised video segments from the Ego4d-\nHCap dataset, with a 3-minute duration per segment. During segments-\nlevel training, the model received two inputs, fine-grained descrip-\ntions 𝐶𝑠 for every 4 seconds of video, along with a visual embedding\nfor every 3 minute of video generated by the feature encoder after\nsubsampling to a fixed dimension. The model is supervised with a\ntextual description 𝑌 𝑠 for the entire 3-minute long video segment.\nThe fine-grained video captions and visual embedding are then\ninputted into a VL Alignment module for cross-modal semantic",

The aligned embeddings are subsequently fed into decoder, which acquires basic video summary and understanding capabilities from the ground-truth segment descriptions 𝑌 𝑠 . This phase requires training for up to 50 epochs with batch size of 64. In the second phase, all model parameters are frozen, and the model processes unlabeled target dataset videos, split into 3-minute segments. More specifically the pretrained model from the first phase is used to generate collection of segment descriptions, one for each 3-minute segment of the long-form videos. These captions are then inputted into our meta-prompting with GPT-3.5 as both generator and optimizer, and Gemini-1.5 Flash as the evaluator, iterating through the prompt and summary optimization for up to maximum of 5 iterations to produce pseudo-summaries for each long video in the target domain. We also employ early-stopping for our iterative prompt adaptation, whereby we terminate the loop if there is no improvement. The third phase involves using the pseudo-summaries generated by our iterative prompt adaptation process to train full video summary model on unlabelled long-form videos. During this phase, the model inputs are segment descriptions for every 3 minutes of video, generated with the phase one segment-level model, and full video visual embeddings generated using the features encoder. The model inputs are fed into VL alignment module and the resulting embeddings are then inputted into decoder and supervised using the pseudo-summaries for up to 200 epochs, with the batch size set to 32. We use AdamW optimizer with learning rate of 3𝑒 5 and weight decay of 0.01."

Another limitation is that our method is able to produce summaries without incorporating context and other modalities, akin to describing film watched on mute. Incorporating context and other modalities such as audio and transcripts will improve the quality of the summaries and broaden their usefulness to other tasks, such as search and VQA. Other interesting directions include tunable hierarchical summarisation, so that we can extract summaries at any resolution, from short clip all the way to the full video. Our LLM-based meta prompting component can also be more broadly investigated and made more general and reusable to other applications. In this sense, ViSMaP is first step in journey to develop accessible and robust video understanding techniques. = 𝜆 Table 7: Evaluating LLMs in meta-prompting.
