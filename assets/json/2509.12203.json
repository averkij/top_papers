            "title": "1\nDrag-based editing in diffusion models remains fundamentally chal-\nlenging. To preserve object identity during editing, prior methods\noften perform implicit point matching via attention. A common\nstrategy, introduced by MasaCtrl [Cao et al. 2023], shares key and\nvalue tokens during attention. However, this strategy allocates more\nattention weights to spatially nearby regions instead of semantically\nrelated ones [Feng et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2025a], which leads to\nunstable and degrading edits. Rather than tackling this fundamental\ncause, as a compromise, many methods rely on test-time optimiza-\ntion (TTO) or weakened inversion strength. These compromises\nmask the mismatch and incur costs, including unreliable inpainting,\nsuppressed text guidance, and distorted edits.",
            "content": "Instead of the compromise, we take principled alternative: replace implicit attention-based matching with an explicit correspondence map and inject it directly into the generation process. With this reliable map, editing under full-strength inversion becomes stable without TTO, enabling faithful inpainting and text-guided generation. Beyond addressing the fundamental issue, the choice of network architecture remains crucial for editing. The recent transition from U-Nets [Rombach et al. 2022] to Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT) [Esser et al. 2024] provides an ideal foundation for this shift, because MM-DiTs offer tighter visiontext fusion, which improves inversion robustness and raises the ceiling for attention control. As shown by ColorCtrl [Yin et al. 2025], this architecture supports stronger semantic consistency and controllability, allowing attention control to be applied across all single-stream attention (SS-Attn) layers without manual selection of specific layer indexes like that in U-Nets. We exploit these advantages by building our method on MM-DiTs. Unlike in U-Nets, identity preservation in MM-DiTs is non-trivial. Simply sharing key and value tokens, as in DiTCtrl [Cai et al. 2025], does not reproduce the identity-preserving behavior achieved by MasaCtrl with U-Nets [Cao et al. 2023]. Recently, CharaConsist [Wang et al. 2025a] showed that re-encoding and injecting semantically aligned tokens can preserve identity in MM-DiTs. However, its point matching relies on the average of attention similarity, which is fragile under full-strength inversion and often yields unsuitable edits. In contrast, drag instructions naturally define field that maps handle points to target points, forming deterministic correspondence map. We turn this explicit map into attention controls. This explicit correspondencedriven preservation resolves the root issue, stabilizes edits under full-strength inversion without TTO. As result, it enhances inpainting and text guidance ability, delivering higher fidelity and controllability than prior methods. In this work, we present LazyDrag, training-free method that uses an explicit correspondence map to drive attention controls in MM-DiTs. By resolving the core instability of implicit attention mappings, LazyDrag stabilizes edits under full-strength inversion without TTO, unlocking the full generation ability. Concretely, (i) the drag instructions are converted into an explicit correspondence map, and (ii) identity and background are preserved using attention controls with the map. Together, these components deliver edits under full-strength inversion without TTO, retaining inpainting capability and enabling text-guided edits under ambiguous instructions. As shown in Fig. 1, this allows our method to execute complex edits Fig. 2. Effect of inversion strength. Examples of LazyDrag under different inversion strengths. The additional prompt is red apple in the mouth. where prior works fail: it can open the mouth of the dog and inpaint its interior, or even generate tennis ball via text guidance, which is impossible for methods constrained by low inversion strength (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, it exhibits deep understanding of scene context. For example, when dragging hand using drag instructions alone, the ambiguity of the task, whether the hand should be placed behind back or into pocket, can be resolved through text guidance, allowing users to make precise and meaningful edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyDrag achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring no test-time optimization. To the best of our knowledge, LazyDrag is the first drag-based editing method built with MM-DiTs and the first to adopt full-strength inversion across all sampling steps, which enables natural inpainting and precise text-guided control. Our contributions are threefold: We propose LazyDrag, the first to achieve full-strength inversion in drag-based editing with MM-DiTs. It is accomplished by an explicit correspondence-driven attention controls that eliminates the need for TTO and resolves the core instability of previous works. We resolve the ambiguity of drag instructions by coupling the explicit correspondence map with text guidance, enabling natural inpainting and semantically consistent edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyDrag significantly outperforms all existing methods on Drag-Bench in both quantitative metrics and human preference."

            "content": "Text-to-image and video generation. GAN-based models [Reed et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2023; Yu et al. 2023] have been largely replaced by diffusion models with U-Net backbones [Ho et al. 2020; Rombach et al. 2022] due to better fidelity and stability. However, UNets scale poorly, prompting shift toward Diffusion Transformers (DiT) [Peebles and Xie 2023]. Among them, MM-DiT [Esser et al. 2024] has become the backbone of choice in recent state-of-the-art systems [AI 2024; Esser et al. 2024; Kong et al. 2024; Labs 2024; Liu et al. 2025b; Yang et al. 2024], including FLUX [Labs 2025]. We are the first to introduce drag-based editing method within MM-DiTs. Text-based editing. Training-free text-guided editing methods use pre-trained diffusion models without fine-tuning, offering strong flexibility. Prompt-to-Prompt [Hertz et al. 2023] edits attention maps for localized control, with extensions to images and videos [Cao et al. 2023; Ju et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2024b; Rout et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2025b; Xu et al. 2025]. Recent work explores attention control in MM-DiTs: DiTCtrl [Cai et al. 2025] for long video generation, ColorCtrl [Yin et al. 2025] for light-consistent color edits, and CharaConsist [Wang et al. 2025a] for preserving character identity. Modern approaches such as Step1X-Edit [Liu et al. 2025a] and GPT-4o [OpenAI 2025] have gained popularity due to their efficiency. However, all rely LazyDrag: Enabling Stable Drag-Based Editing on Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers via Explicit Correspondence 3 solely on text, which limits spatial precision. We instead introduce more intuitive and controllable drag-based method. Drag-based editing. Drag-based editing enables users to specify explicit spatial transformations by defining source and target points. Existing methods can be divided into two categories: those requiring test-time optimization (TTO), and those that do not. Most prior works fall into the former, beginning with DragGAN [Pan et al. 2023], and expanding to diffusion-based approaches [Hou et al. 2024; Ling et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2024a; Mou et al. 2024a,b; Shi et al. 2024; Shin et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2025; Zhou et al. 2025]. RegionDrag [Lu et al. 2024] extends the interface to support region-level editing. Some methods [Choi et al. 2025; Jiang et al. 2025] incorporate textual prompts to improve semantic understanding, but still suffers from complex instructions. FastDrag [Zhao et al. 2024] is one of only two notable TTO-free methods, achieving faster inference but still falling short of the quality delivered by TTO-based methods. Inpaint4Drag [Lu and Han 2025] is the other TTO-free method that build on an inpainting model rather than generative model with inversion. However, directly pasting warped image to fill the edited region introduces strong unnatural warping artifacts. Also, its strong sensitivity to the input mask leads to frequent boundary artifacts and blurring, even with assistance from modern mask generators (e.g., SAM [Kirillov et al. 2023]). Therefore, we adopt widely used generative model approach with inversion, rather than an inpainting formulation. Additionally, all prior approaches with inversion rely on low inversion strength, which degrades inpainting quality and limits semantic generation. In contrast, we introduce the first drag-based method for MM-DiTs that leverages full-strength inversion and text-guided attention mechanisms, achieving SOTA performance without any per-image tuning."

Yet after latent initialization, the cue specific to handles is lost, and all moved points are treated uniformly. Forcing exact positional accuracy yields warp artifacts, whereas enforcing naturalness reduces positioning accuracy. Thus, editing accuracy and visual fidelity are in inherent tension. Moreover, its fusion of multiple instructions is brittle: when drags are antagonistic (for example, opening mouth by moving the upper lip upward and the lower lip downward), averaging the displacements cancels motion near the seam and the mouth fails to open. Moreover, the interpolation used to fill newly exposed regions further replicates nearby textures, producing repeated artifacts in large uncovered areas, as in Fig. 11. Identity Preservation in MM-DiTs: CharaConsist. In parallel, 3.1.2 CharaConsist [Wang et al. 2025a] introduces identity preservation in MM-DiTs, though it is not an editing method. To enforce identity preservation, it controls attention by concatenating corresponding source tokens into the key (re-encoded) and value tokens and by blending attention outputs. However, its point matching mechanism is critically flawed: it relies on attention similarity to identify matching points between images, process that is computationally expensive (requiring additional denoising steps) and inherently unstable. Under full-strength inversion, even minor mismatches in the correspondence map can lead to significant visual artifacts, as proved in Tab. 3."

Let the drag instructions be = {(𝒔𝑖, 𝒆𝑖 )}𝑘 𝑖=1, where 𝒔𝑖 and 𝒆𝑖 are the handle and target points of the 𝑖-th instruction. We illustrate two modes for computing the displacement field. In drag mode, we adopt the elasticity-based per-instruction displacement 𝒗𝑖 𝑗 for each 𝒑 𝑗 under the 𝑖-th instruction as in Zhao et al. [2024]; in move mode, we use standard translation and scaling. To avoid failures of averaging under opposing drags, we use robust winner-takesall [Aurenhammer 1991] fusion: each 𝒑 𝑗 is uniquely assigned to its nearest handle, inducing Voronoi partition [Aurenhammer 1991]. 4 Zixin et al.

Here, 2 denotes the Euclidean 𝐿2-norm distance. Thus, = {𝒗 𝑗 }𝑚 𝑗=1 is defined as the displacement field. This approach preserves the full magnitude of opposing drags, enabling complex edits like opening mouth, which is impossible with simple averaging. Details are in Appendix A.2. Initial latent construction and map formalization (Latent Init). With the displacement field established, we construct the initial latent ˆ𝒛𝑇 . This process defines our explicit deterministic correspondence map (M, A) and partitions the latent grid into distinct regions for targeted control. First, we define the set of discrete destination coordinates = {Π(𝒑 𝑗 +𝒗 𝑗 ) 𝒑 𝑗 P}, where Π() projects to the grid. By resolving collisions where multiple source points map to single destination 𝒙 (using winner-takes-all), we get the winner index 𝑗(𝒙) = arg max 𝑗: Π (𝒑 𝑗 +𝒗𝑗 )=𝒙 𝛼 𝑗 and formalize our correspondence map: Matching point map, (𝒙) = 𝒑 𝑗 (𝒙 ) . Matching weight map, (𝒙) = min(1, 𝛼 𝑗 (𝒙 ) ). Next, we partition the latent space Ω into four disjoint sets based on the geometry of the warp. These sets correspond directly to the colored regions in Fig. 3 (a): Background Rbg (gray) that must remain unchanged, Destinations Rdst (red and blue, a.k.a., ) where moved content is rendered with identity preserved, Inpainting Rinp (yellow) initialized from noise, and Transition Rtrans (green) that blends boundaries smoothly. With these regions clearly defined, the updated latent ˆ𝒛𝑇 is constructed by applying specific rule to each region: ˆ𝒛𝑇 (𝒙) = 𝒛𝑇 (M (𝒙)), 𝝐 (𝒙), 𝒛𝑇 (𝒙), if 𝒙 Rdst, if 𝒙 Rinp, if 𝒙 Rbg Rtrans, (2) where 𝝐 (0, I). Crucially, replacing the BNNI interpolation used in FastDrag with Gaussian noise in Rinp is essential. Unlike the uniform noise compared in Zhao et al. [2024], this approach aligns with the diffusion prior, prevents repetitive artifacts as shown in Fig. 11, and enables the ability of high-fidelity, text-guided inpainting discussed in the introduction."

For Inpaint4Drag [Lu and Han 2025], we adopt the refined masks and point pairs provided by the authors at inference, and replace distilled models with original models. Our method is built on FLUX.1 Krea-dev [Labs 2025], adopting the inversion method of UniEditFlow [Jiao et al. 2025] while replacing the editing strategy with our approach. For fair comparison, the number of denoising steps is fixed to 50 for all methods. Following CharaConsist, we activate ID Pres. and Attn Refine (Sec. 3.3) for the first 40 denoising steps, referring to the last activate timestep as the activation timestep. Additional details are in Appendix A.1. Benchmark and evaluation protocol. We evaluate on DragBench [Shi et al. 2024], which contains 205 images with 349 handle and target point pairs. Our primary accuracy metric is MD (mean distance) [Pan et al. 2023]. Although IF (image fidelity) [Kawar et al. 2023], typically computed with LPIPS [Zhang et al. 2018], is widely used, we do not report IF. Previous work [Choi et al. 2025; Lu et al. 2024] shows that successful drag edits necessarily change the image, often increasing LPIPS, whereas an unchanged image trivially attains the best score. Hence, IF can be misleading for drag editing. To obtain complementary, perceptually grounded view, we adopt the VIEScore [Ku et al. 2024] metrics from GEdit-Bench [Liu et al. 2025a]: SC (Semantic Consistency): whether the intended edit has been achieved. PQ (Perceptual Quality): the naturalness of the result and absence of artifacts. (Overall): the overall performance defined in Liu et al. [2025a]. In our setting, the intended edit is specified by the dragging instruction rather than natural-language instruction, but the scoring criteria remain unchanged. Each score ranges from 0 to 10 (higher is better) and is produced by the stateof-the-art MLLM evaluator, GPT-4o2 [Hurst et al. 2024]. To mitigate stochasticity in evaluation, we run every evaluation metrics three times and report both the mean and standard deviation. We additionally report binary TTO-Req (Test-Time Optimization Required) flag indicating whether method requires per-edit test-time optimization (e.g., LoRA fine-tuning or multi-step latent optimization) during inference. More evaluation details are in Appendix A.3."

In the first example, only our method correctly lift the arm with background maintained, while others introduce artifacts, such as distorted hands (e.g., DragText [Choi et al. 2025]) or unintended background changes (e.g., DragNoise [Liu et al. 2024a]). In the second example, most baselines fail to preserve the front structure of the vehicle, whereas our approach maintains it faithfully while applying the desired transformation. Inpaint4Drag [Lu and Han 2025] generates artifacts in the background. The third case shows that only our method successfully modifies the sofa geometry while preserving the integrity of pillows. In the fourth example, our approach correctly interprets hand proximity as intent to insert it into the pocket, while other baselines introducing artifacts. Finally, in the fifth example, only our approach and DragText successfully rotates the head of the tiger to the right without compromising overall image quality. These results are consistent with our quantitative evaluations and highlight the robustness and generality of our method, even without per image tuning or per instruction multi-step latent optimization. More results are shown in Appendix B.1. 4.4 User Study total of 20 expert participants evaluated comparisons between methods on 32 cases randomly sampled from DragBench. For each"

Fig. 6 and Tab. 3 report benchmark results on Drag-Bench. Removing WTA and Latent Init increases MD and slightly reduces PQ and O, indicating that our initialization with the winner-takes-all fusion strategy and random initialization for inpainting regions suppresses repetitive artifacts and improves inpainting quality as proven in the figure. Further disabling background preservation causes additional drops in SC and due to color shifting and artifacts in the background. Finally, replacing our correspondence-driven preservation with attention-similarity control leads to sharp degradation, highlighting the sensitivity of full-strength inversion to mismatched attention alignment. The full method achieves the best performance. Effect of activation timesteps. We conduct an ablation study on the effect of activation timesteps by varying the activation timestep to 20, 40, and 50, as shown in Fig. 7 and Tab. 4. From the results, we observe that increasing the number of the activation timestep leads to more accurate destination points for dragging, though it may introduce more warping artifacts. Conversely, reducing the activation timestep results in more natural outputs, but may cause slight variations in identity or motion. More results are in Appendix B.4. For benchmark evaluations, we use 40 as balanced value. Fig. 6. Qualitative cumulative ablation on Drag-Bench. Rows remove one component relative to the row above.

The move mode tends to better preserve identity, as seen in the last two cases, rather than performing edits involving rotation or extension, as in the second and third examples. In contrast, the drag mode enables natural geometric transformations, including 3D rotations and extensions, albeit with slight degradation in detail texture preservation. Both of two modes can generate reasonable results. These findings highlight the flexibility of our explicit correspondence map when paired with our correspondence-driven preservation strategy. Future work may explore more matching strategies, such as 2D rotation, to further enhance diversity and controllability."

            "content": "We presented LazyDrag, the first training-free method for dragbased editing with MM-DiTs under full-strength inversion. We begin by identifying the fundamental cause of instability in dragbased editing: the unreliability of implicit attention-based point matching. This diagnosis explains why prior methods adopted compromises such as test-time optimization or weakened inversion strength, which suppress text guidance, harm inpainting, and limit generative ability. Our approach directly solves this core issue by replacing fragile implicit point matching with an explicit correspondence map that drives attention controls during generation. This correspondence-driven preservation enables robust edits under full-strength inversion without TTO. As result, LazyDrag preserves identity and background, supports faithful inpainting, and leverages text guidance to resolve ambiguity in drag instructions. Extensive experiments show that LazyDrag achieves state-of-theart performance, unifying precise control with text guidance to execute complex semantic edits. By revealing that the perceived stabilityquality compromise is an artifact of flawed point matching, LazyDrag establishes more powerful and principled foundation for future research and marks concrete step toward intuitive, AI-native creative workflows and more sophisticated generative control."

DragNeXt: Rethinking Drag-Based Image Editing. arXiv preprint arXiv:2506.07611 (2025). Implementation Details Inference Settings A.1 For all baselines, we use their official code with default hyperparameters for inference. The number of denoising steps is set to 50, and classifier-free guidance (CFG) [Ho and Salimans 2021] is set to 1. All images on Drag-Bench are generated at their original resolution, while other images are generated at 1024 1024. All generations are performed on single NVIDIA H800 GPU. EasyDrag [Hou et al. 2024] and CLIPDrag [Jiang et al. 2025] are excluded from comparison because their released implementations either fail to execute reliably or do not reproduce the results reported in the papers. For Inpaint4Drag, we remove the LCM [Luo et al. 2023] LoRA and fix the number of denoising steps to 50. We also replace the distilled VAE [Kingma and Welling 2013] with the original VAE to improve reconstruction and generation quality. These settings are chosen to obtain the strongest editing performance rather than to optimize for speed. For our inversion process, we adopt the official inversion method of UniEdit-Flow [Jiao et al. 2025] but replace the editing component with our proposed strategy. We apply our correspondence-driven preservation (Sec. 3.3) only to the single-stream attention layers in FLUX.1 Krea-dev [Labs 2025]. Since additional manipulation in dual-stream attention layers does not lead to noticeable improvements [Deng et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2025b; Yin et al. 2025], we adopt more efficient and concise design by limiting modifications to single-stream layers only.

For SC, we adopt the instruction shown in Fig. 14, together with the source image, drag-instruction image, and the edited image. Score collection and calculation are carried out using the official GEdit-Bench codebase. A.4 User Study Details To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we randomly selected 32 results for eight comparison methods on Drag-Bench [Shi et al. 2024] and shuffled their indices to ensure fair comparison. We invited 20 participants, each with relevant skills, to perform the tasks following the instructions provided through the user interface, as shown in Fig. 13. Fig. 10. Failure cases on Drag-Bench. More Results and Analysis B.1 More Results on DragBench Fig. 12 presents additional qualitative results on Drag-Bench. As shown, our method produces more natural and accurate outputs while better preserving background consistency compared to other baselines. These results further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of LazyDrag. LazyDrag: Enabling Stable Drag-Based Editing on Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers via Explicit Correspondence 11 U-Net-based FastDrag [Zhao et al. 2024]. First, we replace the original average blending of multiple drag instructions with our WTA blending. Second, we substitute the original BNNI interpolation with standard normal noise added to the image latent, scaled to the inversion strength. As shown in the top row of Fig. 11, our blending method improves target localization under complex, multiinstruction scenarios. This is reflected in improved MD and SC scores in Tab. 5, computed on Drag-Bench (which includes 97 multidrag cases). In the bottom row of Fig. 11, our random initialization reduces repetitive pattern artifacts, aligning with the quantitative gains in PQ and O. B.4 Limitations Fig. 9 illustrates failure cases on Drag-Bench when the final activation timestep is set too high for handling multiple dragging instructions. While the results show accurate target positions for the dragged points, they exhibit unnatural artifacts, especially when target points overlap. By slightly reducing the final activation timesteps, the results appear more natural while still preserving reasonable target positions. Additionally, due to the VAE compression in diffusion models and the latent patching strategy[Esser et al. 2024], the model struggles with very small drag distances. As shown in Fig. 10, the model can execute fine-grained edits such as closing the eyes, but slight positional shifts may still occur. Moreover, the quality of both the edit and generation heavily depends on the underlying base model. As foundation models continue to improve, we anticipate that the performance and applicability of our method will evolve accordingly. Fig. 11. Qualitative ablation of WTA and Latent Init with U-Nets on DragBench. B.2 Effect of Text Guidance Fig.8 shows examples from Drag-Bench with different text guidance prompts. The results demonstrate that LazyDrag effectively resolves ambiguities caused by drag instructions alone when additional guided prompts are provided. Unlike prior methods such as DragText[Choi et al. 2025] and CLIPDrag [Jiang et al. 2025], our approach enables more complex and precise text guidance. B.3 Effect with U-Nets While our full method is designed for MM-DiTs, key components such as WTA and Latent Init (Sec. 3.2) are also compatible with U-Nets. To demonstrate this, we conduct an ablation study on the 12 Zixin et al. Fig. 12. Additional qualitative results compared with baselines on Drag-Bench.
