            "content": "Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the automatic generation of long-form stories containing several thousand words. This advancement has led to the proposal of various frameworks (Yang et al., 2022, 2023; Zhou et al., 2023) that are capable of generating stories maintaining narrative coherence. In pursuit 1Our code are https://github.com/EMNLP-2024-CritiCS/ Collective-Critics-for-Creative-Story-Generation available publicly at of this capability, many frameworks adopt twostep approach (Fan et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2019; Fang et al., 2021; Tian and Peng, 2022): (a) creating story plan; and (b) generating detailed story based on the plan. To explore further, some works have made effort to improve structure of story plan (Wang et al., 2023b) and refine the writing style (Kong et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2023b). Despite their ability to produce consistent and coherent text, these works frequently fall short in crafting creative long-range narratives that captivate human interest, such as stories with emotional flow, flashback structures, and other engaging elements (Zhang et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023b). Therefore, we propose Collective Critics for Creative Story Generation (CRITICS), novel framework for long-form story generation that integrates collaborative critique into the plan-to-story framework. Our framework focuses on creatively refining story plans (CRPLAN) and enhancing the expressiveness of stories (CRTEXT). Inspired by studies demonstrating that collaborative work significantly enhances creativity through the sharing and integration of knowledge and ideas from various fields (Mamykina et al., 2002; Barrett et al., 2021), CRITICS adopts collaborative critique approach. Specifically, in each stage, multiple LLM critics evaluate the draft and provide suggestions for improvement based on criteria (e.g., uniqueness of the narrative flow and vividness of the generated text) which is designed for assessing creativity (Mozaffari, 2013). Then, leader selects critique that best helps refine the draft. This revision process iterates through multiple rounds to produce final plan and story (Figure 1). In CRPLAN, the critics focus on infusing originality into the story plan (e.g., unexpected shifts in the storys atmosphere, twisted endings). To do so, critics are endowed with personas that are adaptive to given storyline, which helps make clear and diverse suggestions to enhance the storys creativity Figure 1: The framework comprises two stages: CRPLAN and CRTEXT. CRPLAN involves five phases: creating story plan from premise, reviewing the plan with critics persona-driven perspectives, selecting critique for revision by leader, storing the revised plan, and choosing plan for further development by an evaluator. Personas of critics are created based on the themes or content of the narratives, which helps in generating detailed and contextually relevant critiques. Please refer to Appendix A.1 critiques and refines long story text based on creative criteria, with leader selecting and improving the best expressions. and coherence. CRTEXT is designed to improve the expressiveness of stories. It refines the narrative to incorporate unique expressions and vivid descriptions. This includes comic book onomatopoeias (e.g., swooosh), figurative phrases (e.g., silent twilight), and detailed sensory experiences (e.g., buzzing market or the sharp tang of sea air). Extensive human evaluation demonstrates that our CRITICS produces more creative and thus interesting plan, and generates expressive story. To be specific, CRITICS outperforms the state-of-the-art method on the metrics of creativity and interestingness by large margin. Additionally, detailed analyses indicate that our design choices for CRITICS (e.g., applying multiple criteria, role of leader critics, and bestowing personas) In addition, CRITICS facilitates interactive human-machine collaboration in writing by enabling humans to participate as any of the players within the framework, refining stories according to their preferences. The main contributions of this study are: 1. We propose framework named CRITICS, which is designed to enhance story plans and text expressiveness creatively through collective critiques based on criteria of creativity. 2. Extensive human evaluation and ablation studies demonstrate that CRITICS effectively creates stories with creativity and coherence, employing key components such as diverse criteria, leaders, and personas. 3. CRITICS supports interactive writing, enabling human users to intervene in critiques and actively refine stories."

            "content": "Long-form Story Generation. In prior research, the focus of automatic story generation is to create short stories composed of several completed sentences (Roemmele and Gordon, 2018; Ammanabrolu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022b). With the development of LLMs, studies on story generation have shifted their focus toward generating longer narratives of several thousand words, maintaining narrative coherence (Yang et al., 2022, 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). Those works have tried to sustain coherence in longer stories by employing story planning techniques such as hierarchical generation (Fan et al., 2018, 2019). This approach involves first crafting broad story outline at high level, which serves as the foundation for the detailed narrative development. Such hierarchical story plans typically consist of outlines with around 1K tokens, allowing for the creation of longer stories without losing coherence. Recent research focuses on creating robust story plans (e.g., story plans with high narrative coherence, story plans with appropriately placed event scenes) (Ammanabrolu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023b) and transferring plain text into literary expressions (Kong et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2023b; Huang et al., 2023b). However, those works fall short in devising unusual, original stories that engage the readers interest. To address these issues, in this study, we focus on the creativity of stories. Creative Writing. The assessment of creativity in creative writing has been persistently discussed among researchers. Traditional approaches to assessing creativity have relied on criteria like novelty and unexpectedness (Barron, 1955; Rhodes, 1961; Blomer, 2011). However, these approaches are abstract, as they typically rely on broad standards for evaluation. The need for specific criteria to assess the writing has led to rubric-based methods using the traits of creative writing (Arter and McTighe, 2001; Young, 2009; Mozaffari, 2013), generally assessing creativity in three aspects (Mozaffari, 2013): Image, Voice, and Originality. In this study, we adopt those criteria to give more detailed guideline for critcs to refine stories. Collaborative Writing. Research on collaborative writing as method to produce creative authoring is actively ongoing (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997; Mamykina et al., 2002; Paulus et al., 2012). Compared to individual writing, collaborative writing can lead to more divergent works by sharing different knowledge (Bayle et al., 1998; Resnick et al., 2005; Sie et al., 2009; Bitter-Rijpkema et al., 2011). The more diverse the backgrounds, skills, and experience levels of the collaborators, the more varied the knowledge shared, enhancing the creativity of the writing. Inspired by this, we design CRITICS to accommodate multiple critics, each with unique characteristics, to increase diversity. Interactive Agents. Recently, there has been strong focus on developing interactive agents powered by LLMs (OpenAI, 2023; Team et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023; OpenAI et al., 2024). These agents aim to enhance collaboration, enabling them to share information and solve complex problems together. Earlier studies (Yao et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a) focused on improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents through interactions. However, recent findings (Huang et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024) suggest that their reasoning abilities cannot improve solely through interaction without external feedback. On the other hand, current research has shifted towards tasks with various possible solutions, such as code generation (Chen et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023; Holt et al., 2023) and embodied AIs (Song et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a; Shek et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b), where agents cooperate to achieve specific goals. Our research utilizes interactive agents to build divergent critique processes for creative long-story generation. Integrating human and agent participants enriches narratives with diverse perspectives, making long stories more engaging and creative."

First, each of the three critics offers suggestion to enhance the draft plan, using their unique expertise. Next, the leader critic evaluates the three suggestions, ranks them, and selects the one it believes to be the best. The chosen suggestion is then applied to refine the plan. For detailed critiques, the three critics are given personas with expertise relevant to the story plan. Meanwhile, the leader is embodied as literature editor or creative writing expert, tasked with reconciling any conflicts. This whole process is repeated over several rounds, after which plan evaluator reviews the candidate plans from each round to select the final one that effectively balance creativity with coherence.

Similar to CRPLAN, the leader choose one of two suggestions for refining expressions. Unlike in CRPLAN, the critics have no persona because Image and Voice criteria provide clear instructions for expression modification, eliminating the need for personas to anchor the story theme. Also, there is no evaluator because different sentences are revised in each round. Please see Figure 1 (bottom) for the whole process.

Experimental findings suggest that more revision rounds leads to significant changes in the story, which can be interpreted as heightened inventiveness. However, this excessive inventiveness significantly detracts from the narratives coherence. For more details, please refer to Section 5.5. Metrics. We conduct pairwise comparison for human evaluation following Yang et al. (2023). Additionally, we employ metrics to measure the creativity of the stories from Zedelius et al. (2019).

This signifies the effectiveness of CRPLAN in enhancing the creativity of stories while maintaining coherence. Additionally, we observe that as stories are revised by critiques, the coherence of the story also improves. This improvement is attributable to the detailed critiques generated through the persona-driven critique, which facilitates sensitive modifications to the existing narrative content. Such detailed storytelling ensures that the robust narrative without omissions, unfolding clearly and conveying strong coherence to readers.

            "content": "Diversity of Criteria. To assess the effect of criteria diversity, we conduct comparative study. In one setting, we assign the same criterion to all critics, while in the other, each critic is given different criteria. Table 5 shows examples comparing the refined story plans through single criterion and three criteria critiques in CRPLAN. The critique based on single criterion reveals limitations in creating various story flows, such as changes in narrative structure, changing only narrative settings, such as ethical dilemmas or digital worlds. Conversely, revisions made through threecriteria critique contribute to various aspects of storytelling originality, including unique story materials and narrative structures. The initial plan might feature straightforward chronological narrative where John walks down street, finds cash, and returns it to Abe. However, the refined plan evolves into more complex and engaging narrative: it starts with John leading therapy group as an adult. It then cleverly transitions through flashbacks to recount his past with Abe, showing unique narrative structure and themes. This approach enriches the storys depth and significantly demonstrates the potential of three-criteria critiques to enhance narrative creativity and complexity. Single-criterion critiques in CRTEXT might not adequately meet the needs for appropriate improvement. For example, critiquing dialogic sentence like But... why me? using only the Image criterion tends to yield merely detailed description without enhancing its expressiveness such as But... why have been chosen for this? However, incorporating the Voice criterion can transform the sentence into something unique like Umm, but... why me, exactly? by adding filler word, thus enhancing the texts expressiveness. The full plan and story are in Appendix A.3. Different Criteria. To demonstrate our frameworks adaptability across various criteria, we develop specific metrics for creative characters (Dynamic Development) and sentence structures (Inverted and Non-linear Structure), applying these to each CRPLAN and CRTEXT stage, respectively.

They may also deliver critiques on themes unrelated to the central narrative, for instance, commenting on alternate dimensions or parallel universes for story focused on new energy development. These broad and irrelevant critiques undermine narrative coherence and hinder the creation of diverse range of critiques. The full critiques can be found in Appendix A.3. We also conduct an automatic evaluation of 100 story plan pairs using GPT-4, based on evaluation metrics in Section 4. For details on the automatic evaluation methodology, please refer to Appendix B. The results in Fig 2 show that personas foster diverse critical perspectives while maintaining coherence, improving performance across all metrics.

The critics systematically critique the story plans (CRPLAN) and text expression (CRTEXT), employing diverse creative criteria. Their adaptive personas play crucial role in maintaining narrative coherence, providing detailed critiques that help create consistent, contradiction-free, and creative story. Extensive human evaluation demonstrates that the CRITICS significantly enhances the creative dimensions of stories while preserving narrative coherence. Also, CRITICS is designed to facilitate interactive collaboration between humans and machines, allowing active participation of human writers in the critique process. We hope CRITICS opens new dimensions in computational creativity, enabling the generation of unique and captivating narratives."

In this study, we employ the DOC pipeline for story generation, which possibly limits the output format. However, the flexible working mechanism of our CRITICS facilitates the exploration of alternative narrative planning pipelines. In its current design, CRITICS is optimally configured for English language applications. Adapting it for additional languages would require comprehensive revisions to the existing prompt structures. Additionally, in this study, the criteria we use are limited to those defined by Mozaffari (2013).

            "content": "A.1 Adaptive Personas Table 9 presents examples of personas generated using the prompt template from Table 25, adapted to the storys narrative. These personas are created in relation to the emotional turmoil of the character Elinor Grays, the dystopian future setting, and the societal constraints featured within the story. This allows for generating more detailed and relevant critiques of the narrative context. A.2 Other Criteria We apply creative character and creative sentence structure criteria at each stage of our framework. Below are detailed explanations for each criterion: Dynamic Development: Dynamic development refers to the evolution of character over the story. This transformation is often driven by conflicts, challenges, and experiences that compel the character to change. Inverted and Non-linear Structures: Inverted structures involve rearranging the typical order of words or phrases to emphasize particular elements, whereas non-linear structures disrupt the chronological flow of the narrative, encouraging readers to piece together the timeline. Table 10 presents an example of applying dynamic development during the CRPLAN phase. As illustrated in this example, events related to Gabriels narrative loyalty to William emerge. This leads to conflict situation for Gabriel, making the protagonists character more dynamic. Also, Table 11 provides an example of applying inverted and non-linear structures during the CRTEXT phase. In this example, by altering the typical subject-verb order to emphasize serious danger at the beginning of the sentence, the inverted sentence structure highlights the risks preceding the potential. These examples demonstrate that our framework operates effectively across various creative criteria. Initial Plan 1. Calvin Blake meets Eleinor Grays and discovers that, unlike him, she is unable to feel. a. Calvin Blake notices that Eleinor Grays struggles with suppressing her emotions, and realizes there may be something different about her. b. Calvin tries to act naturally around her, not wanting to risk their cover, but also drawn to her lack of emotion. c. Calvin and Eleinor are caught in moment of feeling by James Blake. 2. Calvin and Eleinor must navigate the societal constraints of dystopian future where emotions are outlawed, to be together and feel alive again. ... Adaptive Personas Expert 1. Profession: Sociologist Feedback Focus:Societal dynamics and world-building Feedback Focus Details: Expert 1 will focus on evaluating the societal constraints and dynamics within the dystopian world, such as the laws and regulations surrounding emotions. They will provide insights on whether the world-building is consistent and believable, and suggest ways to enhance the portrayal of the dystopian society. Expert 2. Profession: Psychologist specializing in emotions Feedback Focus: Emotional depth and authenticity Feedback Focus Details: Expert 2, psychologist specializing in emotions, can provide valuable insights into the emotional aspects of your story. They can evaluate the depth and authenticity of the emotions portrayed by your characters and suggest ways to enhance their emotional journeys for more impactful and engaging storyline. Expert 3. Profession: Futurist Feedback Focus: Worldbuilding and believability Feedback Focus Details: Expert 3, futurist, can offer expertise in worldbuilding and ensuring the believability of your dystopian future. They can evaluate the consistency and coherence of your futuristic setting, as well as provide insights into possible societal developments and technological advancements that could enhance the overall plausibility of your novel. Table 9: Example of adaptive personas related to the story elements like social, dystopian future, emotion. A.3 Ablation Study Example the storys seamless and logical progression. In CRITICS, we incorporate diverse array of LLM critics and modules. To assess the effectiveness of each module and the value of collaborative critique, we conduct three ablation experiments: Leader, Criteria,2 and Persona. Our ablation study illustrates the impact of each modules removal with specific examples. Role of Leader. Table 12 presents examples that compare story plans refined with leader involvement against those generated without it in CRPLAN. In the example without leader, the narrative faces criticism for handling the plotline of Jakes disappearance and the groups delve into political secrets simultaneously, leading to noticeable inconsistency. Jake, previously noted as missing, unexpectedly returns in the subsequent scene with no given rationale. On the other hand, the example featuring leader critique meticulously preserves the narratives intricate layers. It carefully navigates through Jakes disappearance and explores the nuances of Sarahs relationship, thereby maintaining 2Refining story using only single criterion. Table 13 illustrates the outcomes of applying all critiques without selecting any through leader during the CRTEXT. The example underscores the importance of tailoring text expressions or scenarios, such as character dialogues, with suitable creative criteriafor instance, incorporating colloquialisms like \"yknow\" to enhance authenticity. This shows the necessity for system like leader, which selects critiques based on the context, ensuring that refinements are appropriately applied to enhance the texts expression. Diversity of Criteria. Table 14 shows examples comparing story plans refined through single criterion critique (Originality in plot/setting/themes) with those refined using three criteria critiques within CRPLAN. The single-criterion critique, which concentrates exclusively on originality, typically makes minor adjustments to particular story elements like ethical dilemmas or digital settings without significantly transforming the story structure. In contrast, the three-criteria critique approach prompts more substantial alteration in the narratives structure. This approach introduces Initial Plan 1. Gabriel, the loyal soldier, is disturbed by Jonass unusual experiments and begins to distrust William. a. Gabriel is initially loyal to William and defends his actions to Isabelle. Scene: the forest on the island, where Gabriel confronts Isabelle and Jared after they are caught snooping around. b. However, as Jonass experiments yield frightening results, Gabriel starts to doubt Williams motivations and fears for the safety of the islands inhabitants. Scene: the lab, where Gabriel confronts Jonas about his experiments. c. He attempts to persuade his comrades to defy Williams orders and stop Jonas. Scene: the barracks, where Gabriel speaks with the other soldiers about Jonass experiments. ... Critiques - Dynamic Development Question: Could Gabriel Stone have backstory where he owes his life or career to William Rhodes due to critical incident in the past, thus complicating his loyalty? How does Gabriels realization of the destructive nature of Williams experiments conflict with this debt, and what specific event triggers his decision to oppose William? Refined Plan 1. Gabriels deep-seated loyalty is rooted in his past with William. a. Gabriel owes his life and career to William after critical rescue during military operation. b. William mentors Gabriel, seeing potential in his resilience and moral compass. 2. Gabriel, now loyal soldier, starts to question the morality of Williams actions due to Jonass unsettling experiments. a. Gabriel defends Williams intentions to Isabelle but harbors doubts. Scene: The forest on the island, during tense confrontation with Isabelle and Jared. b. As experiments escalate, Gabriels fear for the islands safety grows, conflicting with his indebtedness to William. Scene: The lab, during heated discussion with Jonas. c. Gabriel decides to oppose William after witnessing particularly horrific experiment. ... b. Gabriel, conflicted by loyalty and morality, decides to protect Victoria and confront William. Scene: The forest, as chaos ensues from the lab. Characters: Victoria Heller, William Rhodes, Gabriel Stone ... Table 10: Example of refining story plan in the CRPLAN stage using the Dynamic Development criterion. fresh themes, exemplified by the emergence of an art therapy group storyline. It integrates narrative techniques such as flashbacks, leading to notable modifications in the storys framework and broadening the array of narrative elements. Table 15 presents examples of critiques from single LLM based on the Image criterion, which is constrained and cannot accommodate unique expressions tailored for special situations, such as conversational dialogue. As result, relying solely on single criterion for critiques can restrict the breadth of feedback, potentially leading to an undue emphasis on refining specific aspects of the text without adequately addressing nuances like natural conversational expressions. Role of Persona. Table 16 illustrates the contrast between persona and non-persona critiques. The examples reveal that non-persona critiques often suggest general story improvement, such as enhancing narrative structure or reorganizing the storyline. Additionally, they may produce critiques on themes disconnected from the main narrative, like suggestions about alternate dimensions or parallel universes that bear no relation to story focused on new energy development. These broad and unrelated critiques can undermine the storys coherence and limit the diversity of constructive feedback."

As shown in Table 20, we measure each annotators Cohens kappa score and found fair to moderate level of agreement, indicating the reliability of GPT-4s automatic evaluations. The results show that both human and GPT-4 evaluations exhibit similar trends with lower kappa scores for Relevant due to data bias, where most annotators rated options as good, suggesting alignment between GPT-4s automatic evaluations and human judgments."

The results, illustrated in Table 23, demonstrate that personas contribute to fostering diverse critical perspectives while maintaining coherence, leading to performance improvements across all assessed metrics. Detailed Critique Process As shown in Table 24, the detailed critiques produced in this manner help improve the storys coherence by allowing for precise modifications of the existing narrative content. In the initial story plan, there is only brief mention that Shannon discovers the ugly realities of the inner city. However, the creation of social worker persona within the inner city leads to the generation of critiques that integrate social issues into the narrative. This results in more detailed depiction of the harsh realities faced by inner-city communities. Such detailed storytelling gives readers the impression that the story is thorough, with no missing content and clear progression, leading to high marks for narrative coherence. setting of 0.

In CRPLAN, we employ method where leaders and critics utilize ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo), set at temperature of 1, to generate critiques of story plans. persona creation guide is followed to ensure narrative coherence throughout this process, as outlined in . Critics are tasked with crafting three distinct critiques based on predefined criteria, from which they will choose one to explore in greater depth. This process is followed by specific prompts and criteria detailed in Table 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30. The next step involves refining these story plans based on the critiques, guided by prompts in Table 31. The evaluator sees the selection of one optimal revised story plan from the refined versions. This selection relies on process adapted from Wang et al. (2022a), which uses GPT-4 automatic evaluation mechanism with temperature Table 38 shows an example of refined plan wherein the protagonists loneliness is anthropomorphized, enhancing the uniqueness of narrative setting. Full story is provided in Table 39. E.3 Complex Character Relation. Table 40 shows an example of complex network of character relationships within an extended narrative. E.4 Human-Machine Interactive Writing. Table 41 and Table 42 show examples of narratives generated through human-machine interactive writing, created based on the premise of baby skeleton riding skateboard. During the critique process in the CRPLAN stage, human user add new critique content related to skateboarding tricks, which leads to the inclusion of skateboarding elements in the story. In the CRTEXT stage, the plain expression vintage skateboards and photographs, capturing his daring stunts is revised to the more expressive chock-full with retro boards, killer shots of his gnarly stunts. These changes enhance the tone and style of the narrative context, making it more vivid and dynamic. Additionally, we develop web interface to facilitate this interactive writing process, demonstrating its usability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios, as illustrated in Figure 5.

On sunny afternoon, as the school day came to close, John found himself sitting in the art therapy group that he had worked so hard to create.

John had always been hesitant to reveal his own battles with anxiety and depression, but today felt different. Today, he knew it was time to let go of his insecurities and share his story. Taking deep breath, John stood up in front of the group. His hands trembled slightly as he held up canvas painted with swirls of dark blues and stormy grays . The painting reflected the chaos and turmoil within his own mind, visual representation of the constant battle he faced. \"Ive always felt like was drowning in my own thoughts,\" John began, his voice wavering slightly. \"Anxiety has been suffocating presence in my life, making it impossible to focus on anything else. Its like storm that rages inside me, constantly churning and swirling, making it hard to find any sense of calm.\" As John spoke, his gaze shifted from the canvas to the faces of the members in his art therapy group. Alyssa sat nearby, her eyes filled with understanding and compassion. Jake, his childhood friend, leaned forward attentively, offering reassuring smile that conveyed both support and admiration. The room fell into hushed silence as John continued to reveal the inner turmoil that had plagued him for so long. The vulnerability he displayed in sharing his struggles resonated deeply with the group members , many of whom had faced their own battles with mental health. Each brushstroke in Johns painting seemed to capture the weight of his anxiety and depression, the tangled web of thoughts and worries that consumed him.

But as he looked around the room, he saw understanding in their eyes. They had all experienced their own struggles with mental health, and Johns words resonated deeply within them. Alyssa was the first to break the silence. Her voice trembled as she spoke, her eyes filled with empathy. \"John, thank you for sharing. Your words are powerful, and your vulnerability is strength.\" Jake nodded in agreement, his normally lighthearted expression replaced with sincere concern. \"Youre not alone in this battle, man,\" he said softly. \" Were all here for you, every step of the way.\" John felt lump forming in his throat as he absorbed their support.

Their friendship blossomed as they spent more time together, bonding over their shared experiences and dreams for the future. One day, as John and Alyssa sat on park bench, discussing their latest art projects, Jake approached them with mischievous smile. He held up flyer for local art exhibition. \"Hey guys,\" he said, his excitement evident in his voice, \"I found this and thought it might interest you. Its an open call for artists to showcase their work at the town gallery next month.\" Johns heart skipped beat as he scanned the flyer and saw the colorful images of various artworks that adorned its surface. The vibrant brushstrokes and intricate details ignited spark within him, reminding him of his passion for art that he had almost forgotten amidst his struggles with mental health. Alyssas eyes lit up with equal enthusiasm as she leaned in closer to examine the paintings on the flyer. Her fingers traced along the edges of particularly striking piece, her excitement growing alongside Johns. \"This is amazing,\" Alyssa said, her voice barely able to contain her joy. \"We should definitely submit our work. It could be chance to showcase our art and connect with other artists who understand us.\" John nodded, smile tugging at the corners of his lips. The thought of displaying his art in public exhibition filled him with both anticipation and anxiety. But he trusted Alyssas words and believed in the power that art held to transcend language and communicate emotions. As they walked down the school hallway, John couldnt help but reflect on how far he had come.

Her mind was weary from long day at work, each minute feeling like an hour as she navigated through endless meetings and demanding deadlines. As the sun started to set, casting its golden glow across the city , Aimee couldnt help but notice the beauty of the sky. The vibrant hues of orange and pink painted breathtaking scene above her. Finally reaching her apartment building, Aimee climbed up the worn-out stairs, her anticipation growing with each step. But as she opened the door to her small apartment, she was met with an overwhelming emptiness that seemed to fill the air. The silence enveloped her like heavy cloak, amplifying the ache in her heart. Aimee had grown tired of returning home to the same empty space day after day, feeling as though she was missing something vital in her life. As she stood in the midst of her silent apartment, Aimee couldnt shake off the feeling that there was an eerie presence accompanying her. It wasnt physical presence per se, but rather an intangible entity that seemed to lurk in the corners of her vision. Loneliness. Loneliness, personified as shadowy figure with long, wispy tendrils that reached out towards Aimee, exuded an aura of melancholy. Its form was constantly shifting, appearing as haunting silhouette one moment and dissipating into thin air the next. Yet, there was no mistaking its presence. Aimee felt her heart race as she stepped further into her apartment, the front door clicking shut behind her. The dim lighting created an atmosphere of uncertainty, casting long shadows across the room. She hesitated for moment, her eyes fixated on the ethereal figure before her. Loneliness. The name echoed in Aimees mind as she stood frozen, her body trembling with mix of fear and curiosity. Loneliness seemed to study her, its ghostly presence holding an unspoken invitation. Aimee took tentative step forward, drawn to the figure despite her apprehension. The room had transformed in the presence of Loneliness. The once cozy and familiar living space now felt cold and desolate. The air hung heavy with an oppressive silence, the vibrant colors of her belongings muted into shades of gray. Aimee could feel the weight of her loneliness pressing down on her chest, suffocating her. Loneliness moved closer, its wispy tendr ils swaying in the stillness of the room. Aimees heart pounded in her chest, her breaths coming in shallow gasps. She could see Lonelinesss form shifting and swirling like smoke, as if it were made of mist and shadow. As Aimee stood frozen in place, Loneliness extended ethereal hand towards her, its touch sending shivers down her spine. Aimee couldnt tear her eyes away from the figure before her - the embodiment of all her pain and longing. In voice that seemed to resonate within Aimees very soul, Loneliness whispered words that pierced through the silence of the apartment. \"You will always be alone. No one will ever truly understand you,\" it hissed, its voice echoing with haunting emptiness. Aimee felt her heart ache as Lonelinesss words seemed to confirm her deepest fears. She had spent countless nights searching for someone who could see beyond her facade and truly understand her, but each time she found herself more disappointed and disillusioned. Loneliness had become her constant companion, cruel reminder of her isolation. But just as Aimee began to lose hope, there was soft knock on the door. Startled, she turned toward the entrance of her apartment, her eyes still fixated on Loneliness. She hesitated for moment, her heartbeat pounding in her ears. Who could it be? And why now, when she was at the lowest point of her despair? Taking deep breath, Aimee slowly made her way to the door. She gently placed her hand on the doorknob, feeling mix of apprehension and hope swirling inside her. With shaky hand, she turned the knob and pulled open the door. There stood Kyle Johnson, his genuine smile warming Aimees heart. His wavy chestnut hair was slightly tousled from the wind, and his bright blue eyes sparkled with kindness. Aimee couldnt help but let out small gasp of surprise and relief. It was as if the universe had finally heard her plea for companionship and sent Kyle right to her doorstep. \"Hey, Aimee,\" Kyle greeted her, his voice filled with warmth. \"I hope Im not interrupting anything.\" Aimee shook her head, genuine smile tugging at the corners of her lips. \"No, not at all,\" she replied, her voice laced with newfound hope. \"Actually, you couldnt have come at better time.\" Kyles smile widened, mirroring the growing excitement in Aimees eyes. \"Im glad to hear that,\" he said sincerely. \"I was thinking about grabbing dinner nearby, and remembered how you mentioned this new Italian restaurant. Would you like to join me?\" Aimees heart flutter ed at the invitation. She couldnt believe her luck.

Id love to,\" she replied, feeling surge of happiness that radiated through her entire being. As they stepped out of the apartment, Aimee couldnt help but notice the change in the atmosphere. The evening air felt lighter, filled with sense of possibility and connection that she hadnt felt in long time. She glanced back at her apartment, where Loneliness stood silently at the threshold. Aimee smiled softly as she locked the door behind her, feeling weight lifted off her shoulders.

But there was nothing. The sender was unknown, and the message itself offered no explanation. As Jakes mind raced with possibilities, he couldnt shake the feeling that he had stumbled upon something far bigger than himself. It was like stepping into world of mystery and danger that he couldnt comprehend. Determined to uncover the truth, Jake reached out to his closest friends, Sarah and Tom, knowing that their unique skills and unwavering loyalty would be crucial in navigating this treacherous journey.

The map was intricate, with dotted lines and cryptic symbols that Jake had spent countless hours deciphering. \"Were getting closer,\" Jake said, excitement bubbling in his voice. \"This is it. The final piece to the puzzle. The treasure is within our reach.\" Sarah leaned in closer, her eyes fixed on the map. \"But were not the only ones searching for it,\" she warned. \"We have to be careful.\" Tom scoffed, his confidence unwavering. \"They wouldn stand chance against us. Were the best team there is.\" Emma chimed in, her voice filled with excitement. \"And with this map, we have the upper hand. Its like labyrinth of secrets waiting to be unraveled.\" Jake nodded, his eyes gleaming with determination. \"Thats right. Weve come too far to turn back now. Were going to find that treasure and no one is going to stop us.\" Sarahs gaze met Jakes, mixture of worry and affection in her eyes. \"Just promise me youll be careful, Jake. This treasure seems to have brought out the worst in people. dont want anything bad to happen to you.\" Jake reached out and took Sarahs hand, giving it reassuring squeeze. \"I promise, Sarah. Well all watch each others backs and make sure we come out of this adventure unscathed.\" Tom smirked, crossing his arms over his chest. \"Well, well, its nice to see you two lovebirds sharing moment,\" he chuckled. Sarah shot Tom an annoyed look before turning her attention back to Jake. \"Just be careful, okay? cant bear the thought of anything happening to you.\" Jake smiled at Sarah, grateful for her concern. \"Dont worry, Sarah. promise Ill be careful,\" he reassured her. \"Weve come too far to back down now.\" Tom rolled his eyes and let out mock sigh. \"Oh please, Sarah, its not like were going up against an army here. We can handle whatever comes our way.\" Sarah shot Tom glare before turning her gaze back to Jake. \"Fine, but still, just be cautious. We dont know what kind of dangers lie ahead.\" Jake nodded in agreement. \"Youre right, Sarah. We need to stay vigilant and think carefully about our next moves. We cant afford to make any mistakes now.\" With their plan in motion, the trio ventured deeper into the belly of the city. The air was thick with anticipation as they approached their final destination. The stakes were higher than ever before, and their adrenaline surged through their veins. As they rounded dark corner, they came face to face with steel door. Its ominous presence sent shivers down their spines, but they knew that beyond it lay the ultimate prize they had been tirelessly pursuing. Jake took deep breath and reached for the handle, his heart pounding in his chest. With firm grip, he twisted the door handle and pushed it open, revealing hidden chamber bathed in golden light. Their eyes widened in awe as they took in the sight before them. The chamber was filled with ancient artifacts, sparkling jewels, and stacks of valuable artwork. It was treasure trove beyond their wildest imaginations. As Jake, Sarah, and Tom stepped into the hidden chamber, their jaws dropped in amazement.

Table 41: Example of story plan generated by human-machine interactive writing. The dark and stormy night had finally subsided, leaving behind damp and eerily quiet village. The moon cast an ominous glow over the streets, highlighting the abandoned storefronts and worn cobblestones. It was in this setting that our protagonist, Jane Morgan, stood at the entrance of an old bookstore. As the rain trickled down her coat, Jane pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside. The musty smell of old books filled her nostrils as she walked through rows upon rows of dusty shelves. Lost in the overwhelming array of stories, she drifted further into the depths of the bookstore. Suddenly, gl immer of moonlight caught her eye from corner of the room. Intrigued, Jane cautiously made her way towards the source of the light. As she turned into narrow aisle, the moonlight grew stronger, illuminating peculiar bookshelf that seemed out of place amongst its worn companions. The books on this shelf were pristine, their spines unblemished and their pages untouched by time. One particular book stood out to Jane. Its cover was adorned with an intricate pattern, gleaming silver against backdrop of dark blue leather. Curiosity compelled her to reach out and gently run her fingers along the smooth surface. The moment she touched the book, jolt of energy surged through her fingertips, causing her hand to tremble involuntarily. Wide-eyed and breathless, Jane quickly withdrew her hand, unsure of what had just happened. But the book seemed to react to her touch as well. It began to emit soft glow from its silver pattern, the intricate lines shimmering in the moonlight. Jane could feel an inexplicable connection to this book, as if it held secret waiting to be unraveled. Driven by her curiosity, Jane cautiously reached out once again and gently grasped the book. As she did, surge of warmth envelop ed her hand, spreading through her entire body. The silver pattern on the book grew brighter, illuminating the surrounding area with an otherworldly glow. With newfound confidence, Jane opened the book to its first page. Words appeared before her eyes, written in an elegant script that seemed to dance across the page: \"The untold history of the skate park awaits those brave enough to uncover its secrets.\" Intrigued and feeling sense of destiny, Jane turned another page and was greeted by vivid illustration depicting the skate park in its former glory, full of laughter and excitement. She couldnt help but notice the figure of young girl, her face glowing with joy as she skated through the park. Janes heart filled with an inexplicable longing, as if she somehow knew this girl. As the image on the page seemed to come alive, Shimmers voice echoed in Janes mind. \"That was me,\" she whispered, her voice filled with mix of nostalgia and sorrow. \"I was once skater here, just like you Sammy,\" she confessed, her eyes brimming with emotion. Sammy Skaters eyes widened in surprise as the realization sank in. Shimmer was not just any ghost haunting the skate park; she was its heart and soul, forever connected to the memories and tragedies that had taken place within those old worn-out walls. The dusty attics floor creaked under their weight as Shimmer guided Baby Bones towards weathered wooden crate. With trembling hands, she carefully opened it to reveal an assortment of faded newspaper clippings from decades past. The headlines screamed tales of triumph and tragedy, capturing the essence of bygone era. \"Look,\" Shimmer whispered to Baby Bones, pointing at one particular article. The yellowed paper chronicled tragic accident that had occurred at the skate park long ago. It detailed how young girl named Maxine \"Max\" Decker had met her unfortunate demise while attempting daring trick. Her loss had cast dark shadow over the park, forever changing its vibrant atmosphere. Baby Bones stared at the article, his empty eye sockets fixed on Maxs photograph. He felt deep sense of sorrow and empathy as if he had connection to Max, even though they had never met. He could sense the weight of her tragedy and the impact it had on the skate park. Shimmer watched Baby Bones closely, understanding that this revelation was hitting him hard. She gently placed hand on his bony shoulder, offering comfort in this moment of unraveling the parks dark history. The dusty attic surrounded them, filled with nostalgia and forgotten memories. \"Baby Bones,\" Shimmer began softly, her voice laced with empathy, \"the tragic accident at the skate park involved Maxine Deckers brother. He was prominent skateboarder just like you , Baby Bones. His name was Jake Decker.\" Baby Boness eyes widened beneath his tiny skeleton skull as Shimmer continued her somber revelation. \"Jake was known for his fearless tricks and mesmerizing skills on the skateboard. He was adored by everyone in this skateboarding community, including Maxine.\" The dusty skateboarding museum stood as testament to Jakes legacy, filled with vintage skateboards and photographs capturing his daring stunts. Maxine Decker, Jakes older sister and owner of the vibrant skateboarding shop, stood beside Baby Bones, her eyes glistening with memories as she listened to Shimmer recount the tragedy of the skate parks past. Maxine could still vividly recall the day her brother disappeared, leaving behind void in her heart that never truly healed. As Shimmer spoke, Maxines grip tightened on the skateboard in her hand. She had watched Jake grow into fearless and skilled skateboarder who pushed boundaries and inspired everyone around him.
