Introduction Training large language models (LLMs) to function as autonomous agents in interactive environments presents unique challenges. Unlike static tasks such as math problem solving (Shao et al., 2024) or coding (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024), agent settings require models to make sequential decisions, maintain memory across turns, and adapt to stochastic feedback from their environment. These settingscentral to planning assistants, robotics, and tutoring agentsdemand that models not only perform well, but also self-improve through experience. While recent work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024; Pan et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025) using rule-based reward, it remains largely underexplored to train agents that self-evolve to reason and adapt through rule-based RL. In particular, RL for LLM agents often exhibits training instability, complex reward signals, and limited generalization across prompt variations or environment changesespecially under multi-turn interaction with stochastic feedback. key open question is: what design factors make self-evolving LLM agents learn effectively and stably? We explore this question through systematic study of agent learning under general RL framework StarPO (State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization). StarPO provides unified view of multi-turn, trajectory-level agent training with flexible control over reasoning, reward assignment, and prompt-rollout structure. Built on top of StarPO, we develop RAGEN, modular agent training and evaluation system designed to support the study of RL-based reasoning in LLMs. RAGEN implements the full training loopincluding rollout generation, reward assignment, and trajectory optimizationserving as research infrastructure for systematic analysis of LLM agent training dynamics under multi-turn and stochastic environments. Training LLM agents on real-world tasks such as web browsing and embodied manipulation often relies on extensive pretrained priors and task-specific engineering. To study learning from scratch and independent of these confounding factors, we evaluate LLMs through RAGEN on three stylized gaming environments: Bandit (single-turn, stochastic), Sokoban (multi-turn, deterministic), and Frozen Lake (multi-turn, stochastic). These environments are deliberately minimalistic and fully controllable in difficulty, symbolic variation, and transition dynamics. Crucially, they require agents to learn decision-making policies through environment interaction, relying minimally on pre-existing world knowledge. The shared structure across these tasks (e.g., symbolic grid representations) further enables analysis of cross-task generalization. Using this setup, we analyze three key dimensions of agent learning, and summarize below findings that reveal core challenges and design principles for stable agent RL training: 1. Gradient Stability in Multi-turn RL is the Key to Stable Training. We find that multi-turn RL training often leads to recurring instability pattern, Echo Trap, where agents overfit to locally rewarded reasoning patterns, marked by reward variance collapse, entropy drop, and gradient spikes. To mitigate this failure mode, we propose StarPO-S, stabilized variant of our framework that improves learning robustness through variance-based trajectory filtering, critic baselining, and decoupled clipping. 2. Rollout Frequency and Diversity Shape Self-Evolution. In RL-based agent training, LLM self-generated rollout trajectories are served as core training material. We identify key rollout factors for stable agent RL training: (1) ensuring that rollouts come from diverse prompt set with multiple responses per prompt, (2) implementing multiple actions each turn to improve interaction horizon within fixed turn limit, (3) maintaining high rollout frequency to ensure online feedback reflects current policies. 3. Emerging Agent Reasoning Requires Meticulous Reward Signal. We find that simply 2 Figure 2 The State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization (StarPO) framework. LLM generates reasoning-guided actions for multi-turn interactions with environments and accumulates trajectory-level rewards, normalized and used to update the LLM policy. encouraging reasoning in the action format does not guarantee reasoning behavior. Even when models are prompted to reason (e.g., with <think> tokens) with trajectory-level optimization via StarPO, they often regress to direct action selection if reasoning offers no distinct reward advantage. We assume this is due to the simple action spaces in MDP where shallow strategies suffice. Moreover, when rewards only reflect task success, models produce hallucinated reasoning, revealing mismatch between thoughts and environment states. These issues underscore the need for fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals in RL for long-horizon agent training. Together, our framework and analysis offer insights into the principles behind training reasoning-capable, stable, and generalizable LLM agents. All environments and code are released as part of the RAGEN system. 2. Framework 2.1. The MDP Formulation for Agent Training Previous reinforcement learning (RL) for language models often assumes single-turn setting, where the goal is to maximize the expected reward 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎) over prompt-response pairs (𝑠, 𝑎) sampled from dataset D: 𝐽step(𝜃) = E𝑠D,𝑎𝜋𝜃 ( 𝑠) [𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎)]. (1) However, LLM-based agents must operate in interactive environments that unfold over multiple turns and exhibit stochastic feedback. To capture these dynamics, we formulate the problem as Markov Decision Process (MDP) = {𝑆, 𝐴, 𝑃}, where 𝑆 represents states (e.g., observation sequences or interaction histories), 𝐴 represents actions (often token sequences), and 𝑃 denotes the transition dynamics and reward generation process. The agent policy 𝜋𝜃 generates an action 𝑎𝑡 at each time step 𝑡, conditioned on the current state 𝑠𝑡 and the interaction history. The environment returns reward 𝑟𝑡 and new state 𝑠𝑡+1 given the current transition dynamics: 𝑎𝑡 𝜋𝜃(𝑠𝑡, 𝜏<𝑡), (𝑟𝑡, 𝑠𝑡+1) 𝑃(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡), where 𝜏<𝑡 = {𝑠0, 𝑎0, 𝑟0, ..., 𝑠𝑡1, 𝑎𝑡1, 𝑟𝑡1} denotes the interaction history. This interactive process continues for maximum horizon 𝐾, yielding full trajectory 𝜏 = {𝑠0, 𝑎0, 𝑟0, ..., 𝑠𝐾 } that forms the learning material for the agent. 3 2.2. StarPO: Reinforcing Reasoning via Trajectory-Level Optimization Trajectory-Level Objective in StarPO vs. Previous Methods Previous methods (e.g., PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), GRPO (Shao et al., 2024)): 𝐽step(𝜃) = E𝑥D, 𝑦𝜋𝜃 ( 𝑥 ) [𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦)] (optimize single-turn output 𝑦 given input 𝑥) StarPO (ours): 𝐽StarPO(𝜃) = EM,𝜏𝜋𝜃 [𝑅(𝜏)] (optimize total reward over trajectory 𝜏 = {𝑠0, 𝑎0, 𝑟0 . . . , 𝑠𝐾 }) We introduce StarPO (State-Thinking-Action-Reward Policy Optimization), general RL framework designed to optimize entire multi-turn interaction trajectories for LLM agents. Unlike previous methods for static tasks that treat each action independently, StarPO treats the entire trajectoryincluding observations, reasoning traces, actions, and feedbackas coherent unit for rollout and model optimization. The objective is to maximize expected trajectory reward: 𝐽StarPO(𝜃) = EM,𝜏𝜋𝜃 [𝑅(𝜏)] , where is the MDP, 𝜏 is full sequence of reasoning-augmented interactions, and 𝑅(𝜏) denotes the cumulative reward over the entire trajectory. The policy probability 𝜋𝜃(𝜏) is decomposed into token-level likelihoods, making StarPO directly compatible with autoregressive LLMs. Figure 2 illustrates the full StarPO process, and we break them down in detail below. (2) 2.2.2. Optimization Procedure: Reasoning-Interaction Trajectories At each training iteration, the agent begins from an initial state 𝑠0 and generates 𝑁 trajectories. At each step 𝑡, the agent produces reasoning-guided structured output: 𝑎𝑇 𝑡 = <think>...</think><answer> 𝑎𝑡 </answer>, (3) where 𝑎𝑇 𝑡 is the full action output including intermediate reasoning, and 𝑎𝑡 is the environmentexecutable sub-action. The environment then returns the next state 𝑠𝑡+1 and reward 𝑟𝑡. The rollout stage produces complete trajectories 𝜏 = {𝑠0, 𝑎𝑇 𝐾1, 𝑟𝐾1, 𝑠𝐾 }, where every component is LLM-generated or environment-induced and will be jointly optimized. 0, 𝑟0, 𝑠1, ..., 𝑎𝑇 StarPO interleaves rollout and update steps. New rollouts can be generated on-policy using 𝜋𝜃, or sampled from replay buffer under 𝜋 old. Each training loop consists of 𝑃 initial states 𝑠0, each generating 𝑁 trajectories, and updates are performed with batch size 𝐸 for 𝐿 total loops. This yields 𝑆 = 𝐿𝑃𝑁 𝐸 total gradient steps. Additional training mechanisms are discussed in 3. 2.2.3. Modular Optimization Strategies StarPO supports variety of policy optimization algorithms under unified trajectory-level abstraction. For each rollout trajectory 𝜏𝑖 = {𝜏𝑖,(1) , . . . , 𝜏𝑖,(𝑇 ) } of totally 𝜏𝑖 turns and 𝑇 tokens, we instantiate StarPO with the following optimization strategies for token-level updates: PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). We use the PPO objective (More Details can be found in Appendix A), where critic is trained to estimate token-level value and advantages 𝐴𝑖,𝑡: 𝐽PPO(𝜃) = 1 𝐺 𝐺 𝑖=1 1 𝜏𝑖 𝜏𝑖 𝑡= min (cid:20) 𝜋𝜃(𝜏𝑖,(𝑡) 𝜏𝑖,<𝑡) old(𝜏𝑖,(𝑡) 𝜏𝑖,<𝑡) 𝜋 𝐴𝑖,𝑡, clip (cid:18) 𝜋𝜃(𝜏𝑖,(𝑡) 𝜏𝑖,<𝑡) old(𝜏𝑖,(𝑡) 𝜏𝑖,<𝑡) 𝜋 , 1 𝜀, 1 + 𝜀 (cid:19) (cid:21) , 𝐴𝑖,𝑡 (4) 4 Figure 3 Bi-Arm Bandits environment.

GRPO (Shao et al., 2024). For critic-free training leveraging GRPO, we assign scalar reward 𝑅(𝜏𝑖) to each trajectory and normalize it across the batch. The normalized reward ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 is shared across all tokens in 𝜏𝑖: ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑅(𝜏𝑖) mean({𝑅(𝜏1), . . . , 𝑅(𝜏𝐺)}) std({𝑅(𝜏1), . . . , 𝑅(𝜏𝐺)}) .

The RAGEN System To implement StarPO in practice, we build RAGEN, complete system for LLM agent training in controlled environments. RAGEN supports structured rollouts, customizable reward functions, and integration with multi-turn, stochastic environments. It serves both as the execution backend for StarPO and as platform for studying stability, generalization, and learning dynamics in training reasoning agents. RAGEN is designed to be modular and extensible: new environments, reward schemes, or rollout strategies can be easily plugged into the training loop, serving as foundation for analysis of RL-based agent training. 3. Experiment Setup 3.1. Environments and Tasks We evaluate LLM agents in three minimal yet comprehensive symbolic environments designed to isolate core decision-making challenges. These environments are minimal, controllable, and (a) Sokoban Environment. Actions are irreversible and the boxes cannot be pulled back which needs foresight and careful planning. (b) FrozenLake Environment. Each agent move may randomly slip to side direction, requiring the agent to adapt under uncertainty. Figure 4 Sokoban and Frozen Lake environments. For each environment, the left shows the agent-observed text rendering; the right is visual illustration. (a) Sokoban is deterministic multi-turn puzzle where the agent pushes boxes onto targets. (b) Frozen Lake combines multiturn reasoning and stochasticity where the agent needs to reach the gift to succeed. stripped of real-world priors, enabling clean analysis of reasoning emergence and learning dynamics. Specifically, Bandit (Figure 3) tests risk-sensitive symbolic reasoning under stochastic feedback; Sokoban (Figure 4a) requires irreversible multi-step planning in deterministic setting; and Frozen Lake (Figure 4b) combines planning with probabilistic transitions. More details can be found in Appendix B.1. 3.2. Training Settings We train Qwen-2.5 (0.5B) with StarPO variants on H100 GPUs for 200 rolloutupdate iterations. Each batch samples 𝑃=8 prompts, with 𝑁=16 rollouts per prompt, up to 5 turns and 10 actions. Policy updates use GRPO or PPO with GAE (𝛾=1.0, 𝜆=1.0), Adam optimizer, entropy bonus (𝛽=0.001), and response-format penalty (0.1). More details can be found in Appendix B.2. 3.3. Evaluation Metrics We evaluate on 256 fixed prompts per environment with temperature 𝑇=0.5, truncating episodes after 5 turns. Metrics include: (i) success rate (task completion), (ii) rollout entropy (exploration), (iii) in-group reward variance (behavioral diversity), (iv) response length (reasoning verbosity), and (v) gradient norm (training stability). All are computed over on-policy rollouts and EMAsmoothed. More details can be found in Appendix B.3. 4. Experimental Results and Findings 4.1. Multi-turn agent RL training introduces new instability pattern We begin by evaluating the baseline performance of StarPO under its default configuration across three agent tasks. As shown in Figure 5, most runs exhibit promising improvements during early-stage training but ultimately suffer from performance collapse. This behavior differs from static single-turn tasks, where the collapse issue hardly become the predominant issue. Notably, we observe the PPO variant of StarPO tends to maintain stability longer than the GRPO variant before degradation occurs. For instance, on Bandit and Sokoban, GRPO begins collapsing as early as 20 and 10 steps, respectively, while PPO remains stable until 100 and 50 steps, respectively. These results suggest that while single-turn RL methods like PPO and Figure 5 Baseline StarPO performance across environments. All StarPO runs initially improve but eventually collapse in multi-turn agent settings. PPO variant shows better training stability compared to the GRPO variant, especially in Bandit and Sokoban, indicating that critic-based methods better resist early-stage degradation under long-horizon dynamics. GRPO can initially transfer to multi-turn settings, they may lack robustness for multi-turn agent training where long-horizon interaction is needed; furthermore, the presence of critic (as in PPO) appears to play key role in stabilizing the training dynamics. Surprisingly, GRPO variant on Frozen Lake appear to be more stable than the PPO variant. We conjecture this could be due to the inherent feature of the Frozen Lake task where the state value are hard to estimate which may result in reduced stability of PPO, and provide our detailed analyis in Apprendix F. Finding 1: Single-turn RL may not be directly adapted to Multi-turn agent RL Vanilla adaptations from single-turn methods like PPO and GRPO achieve early gains in agent settings but often collapse. critic in PPO may delay instability, but would not prevent reasoning degradation, highlighting the need for specialized stabilization in agent settings. To understand the causes of collapse, we compare earlyand late-stage trajectories. In the Bandit task, early-stage trajectories exhibit diverse reasoning about symbolic meanings and expected rewards, while later-stage responses become repetitive and deterministic. As shown in Table 1, the top rows (Step 0) display varied hypotheses about Dragon and Phoenix, while the bottom rows (Step 150) converge to near-identical phrasing focused on choosing Dragon without justification. This suggests that RL training may have over-amplified inherent reasoning shortcuts, reinforcing locally rewarded templates while suppressing exploration. We refer to this failure mode as an Echo Trap, where the model repeatedly reuses memorized reasoning paths under reward feedback, leading to collapse in trajectory diversity and long-term performance degradation. Finding 2: Model collapse in agent RL is reflected as \"Echo Trap\" over training We find that early-stage agent respond with diverse symbolic reasoning, but collapse into deterministic, repetitive templates after training. Models converge to fixed phrasing, indicating that RL may reinforce superficial patterns instead of general reasoning and forms an \"Echo Trap\" that hinders long-term generalization. To identify early signs of collapse, we analyze rollout-level statistical signals that reflect behavioral redundancy and policy instability. Specifically, we examine two early indicators: (1) Reward Standard Deviation that measures whether rollouts under the same task instance lead to diverse outcomes or has collapsed into repetitive patterns with similar returns, (2) Output 7 Step Model Output 0 150 150 150 Dragon is often associated with patience, strength, and reliability, while Phoenix is associated with speed, agility, and creativity.

Top rows show diverse reasoning from model before training, while bottom rows show repetitive and collapsed reasoning after RL training. Entropy that captures the uncertainty of the models output, whose sharp drop implies the policy is becoming overconfident and converging to narrow reasoning paths. To determine whether collapse has already occurred, we further track two metrics: (1) Average Reward whose plateau or drop identifies degraded task-solving ability, (2) Gradient Norm that measures update magnitude, with its spikes indicate that small updates are triggering large changes, typically sign of training instability and collapse. Figure 6 summarizes these dynamics across tasks and optimization methods. From the results, we draw the following conclusions regarding how model collapse unfolds in multiturn agent RL: Reward standard deviation could be reliable early signal. For FrozenLake-PPO, the reward mean collapses at step 90, but std drops sharply at step 40well before performance degrades. In Bandit-PPO, std bottoms out around step 70, just before reward peaks at step 120. In Sokoban-PPO, std and mean collapse almost simultaneously around step 10. Gradient norm spikes indicate irreversible collapse. Once gradient norm spikes emergeat step 170 (Bandit), 110 (Sokoban), and 90 (FrozenLake)even small updates induce drastic parameter shifts, after which recovery becomes unlikely. Entropy typically follows stable decay trend during effective learning (e.g., GRPO on FrozenLake). Rapid entropy increases or erratic changes often correlate with collapsed reasoning behavior (e.g. GRPO on Bandit and Sokoban). Finding 3: Collapse follows similar dynamics and can be anticipated by indicators Reward standard deviation and entropy often fluctuate before performance degrades, while gradient norm spikes typically mark the point of irreversible collapse. These metrics provide early indicators and motivate the need for stabilization strategies. These patterns confirm that multi-turn RL introduces unique challenges that single-turn RL methods fail to handle. In response, we introduce StarPO-S, stabilized variant that targets sampling quality, gradient stability, and exploration regularization to avoid premature collapse. Figure 6 Collapse indicators and early warning signals in multi-turn RL. Reward standard deviation and entropy (right-side plots) drop early, often before reward degrades, serving as early warning signals. Reward mean and gradient norm (left-side plots) reflect collapse directlyplateaus and spikes confirm performance and training instability. 4.2. StarPO-S: Stabilize Multi-turn RL with instance filtering and exploration encouragement To address the instability of multi-turn reinforcement learning, we introduce StarPO-S, stabilized variant of StarPO that incorporates three key modifications aimed at improving training robustness and efficiency. Building on the insight that declining reward standard deviation often precedes collapse, we investigate the following question: should agents be trained more intensively on task instances where their behavior is more uncertain with higher reward variance? We hypothesize that the most effective training samples are those where the agent exhibits outcome uncertaintyavoiding both trivial task instances that lack learning value and overly difficult ones that yield little reward signal. This intuition is rooted in principles of active learning (Settles, 2009), where uncertain examples are the most informative ones models should learn from. We define trajectory-level outcome uncertainty 𝑈 for policy 𝜋𝜃 on given agent task instance (initial state 𝑠0 in an MDP = {𝑆, 𝐴, 𝑃}) as: U(𝜋𝜃, M, 𝑠0) = Std𝜏𝜋𝜃 ( 𝑠0 ) [𝑅(𝜏)] . (7) During training, we sort prompts based on the standard deviation of reward obtained from repeated rollouts and retain only the top 𝑝% highly-uncertain prompts at each training step. Figure 7 shows the effect of varying 𝑝 in PPO and GRPO under StarPO-S. In PPO runs (Figure 7, left two figures), filtering out low-variance rollouts significantly delays collapse. For example, 75% retention ratio pushes the collapse point from 100 to 140 steps in FrozenLake, while keeping only 50% of rollouts eliminates collapse within the training 9 Figure 7 Effect of uncertainty-based filtering on multi-turn RL stability. Filtering out lowvariance trajectories reduces collapse risk and improves success rate. On PPO variants, collapse is largely mitigated when more than half of the trajectories are filtered. horizon entirely. GRPO (third figure from left) is inherently less stable due to its critic-free design, but still benefits modestly from variance-based filtering. Interestingly, retaining only high-variance samples also improves training efficiency. As shown in the rightmost sub-figure of Fig 7, keeping just 25% of the rollouts reduces total update steps by half, while not sacrificing early learning gains. We adopt 25% as the default filtering ratio for StarPO-S in our experiments. However, we note that this aggressive value may not be optimal for all settings. Tasks like Sokoban and FrozenLake appear to benefit more from aggressive filtering, potentially due to their relatively repetitive reasoning patterns and under-representation in pretraining, which make them tend to collapse when similar trajectories dominate the batch. Finding 4: Filtering low-variance trajectories improves stability and efficiency Training on high-variance prompts delays or eliminates collapse in multi-turn RL. StarPO-S improves performance and reduces update steps by discarding low-information rollouts, especially under PPO. This aligns with active learning principles, where uncertain examples offer the most informative learning signals. In addition to uncertainty-based filtering, we adopt two stabilization techniques in StarPO-S inspired by DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), originally designed for single-turn RL. We extend and evaluate them in the multi-turn agent setting: KL Term Removal: We eliminate the KL divergence penalty from PPOs objective, relying only on policy loss and entropy bonus for gradient updates. It removes the constraint to stay close to the initial model distribution and encourage the model to explore. Clip-Higher (Asymmetric Clipping): We decouple the PPO clipping range by using low = 0.2). It allows the model to higher upper bound (𝜀 high = 0.28) than the lower bound (𝜀 learn more aggressively from high-reward rollouts for more effective training. As shown in Figure 8, both methods boost the success rate and extend stable training phases, showing how multi-turn RL benefits from more flexible gradient shapingamplifying effective reasoning trajectories while avoiding over-penalization of uncertain ones. Overall Comparison. We compare StarPO-S with vanilla StarPO across three tasks in Figure 9. StarPO-S consistently delays collapse and enhances final task performance. We attribute these gains to more selective training data (via uncertainty filtering), more balanced optimization signals (via KL removal and decoupled clipping), reducing narrowed reasoning modes. 10 Figure 8 Effect of KL removal and asymmetric clipping on PPO stability. Removing KL constraints and enabling stronger positive gradient flow both improve peak performance and delay collapse in multi-turn RL. Figure 9 StarPO-S improves stability and final performance across tasks. Compared to vanilla StarPO, StarPO-S achieves higher success rates and reliefs collapse in all three tasks. 4.3. Generating Useful Trajectories for RL Training Effective RL training depends critically on the quality of trajectory rollouts. We identify three key rollout dimensions that significantly affect learning dynamics and generalization: task diversity, interaction granularity, and rollout frequency. We further analyze how these factors affect generalization by training these models on the vanilla Sokoban task and evaluating them on the SokobanNewVocab, LargeSokoban, and FrozenLake Task, which we detail in Appendix G. Higher task diversity with response comparison improves generalization. Task diversity refers to the number of distinct initial states used during training. diverse prompt set exposes the model to broader decision-making contexts, aiding generalization beyond memorized behaviors. Under fixed batch size, task diversity is inversely related to the number of responses per prompt. In our experiments  (Table 2)  , we vary this trade-off and find that higher task diversityachieved by fewer responses per prompt (e.g., 4 per prompt)consistently yields better generalization. However, this only holds when each prompt includes multiple rollouts, enabling the agent to contrast differnet outcomes under similar scenario and refine its policy. Allowing more action budgets enables planning, while overly long rollouts inject noise. We vary the number of actions allowed per turn in Table 3. Allowing up to 5 or 6 actions per turn 11 Response Per Prompt SingleSokoban SokobanNewVocab FrozenLake 32 16 8 4 2 21.09% 20.31% 20.31% 20.70% 19.92% 19.53% 20.22% 21.48% 19.53% 25.39% 25.00% 22.27% 17.97% 19.53% 17.19% 21.48% 12.50% 12.50% Table 2 Effect of Task Diversity on Generalization Performance (%).

This setting provides enough room for planning while avoiding the chaos of overly long rollouts. Increasing the budget to 7 actions degrades performance, likely due to noisy transitions and diluted reward feedback. Frequent rollout updates ensure alignment between optimization targets and current policy behavior. As shown in Figure 10, agents trained with up-to-date rollouts (online-style collection every 10 updates) achieve faster convergence and higher final success rates compared to agents relying on older rollouts, on both direct evaluation (left) and generalization evaluation (middle and right). We highlight core design principle in multi-turn RL: learning is most effective when trajectory data reflects the agents most recent behavior. Frequent sampling mitigates policy-data mismatch and prevents optimization using outdated policy states. Frequent rollout updates align optimization with the current policy and stabilize learning. To investigate the effect of rollout freshness, we adopt an Online-𝑘 rollout strategy, where single set of rollouts is reused for 𝑘 consecutive policy updates. smaller 𝑘 implies more frequent rollout collection. Notably, Online-1 corresponds to an almost fully online setting, with fresh rollouts collected every update iteration. Importantly, we keep the update batch size fixed across conditions, isolating the effect of rollout frequency from optimization scale. As shown in Figure 10, agents trained with fresher rollouts (Online-1) achieve faster convergence and better generalization across tasks compared to those with delayed updates (e.g., Online-5 or Online-10). This supports core design principle for multi-turn RL: learning is most effective when trajectories reflect the agents latest behavior. Frequent rollout refresh reduces policy-data mismatch and improves optimization stability. 12 Train on Bandit Bandit Bandit-Rev FrozenLake LargeSokoban Train on Sokoban Sokoban SokobanNewVocab StarPO-S NoThinking 100.00 81.25 67.58 56.25 19.92 19. 2.34 2.73 21.48 20.73 18.75 26.17 Table 4 Generalization performance (%) with and without reasoning under StarPO-S. Disabling <think> tokens significantly reduces generalization in single-turn Bandit task, but has mixed or marginal effects in multi-turn Sokoban task. Figure 10 Performance under different rollout frequencies (Online-𝑘). We vary the rollout reuse factor 𝑘, where each rollout batch is used for 𝑘 consecutive policy updates while keeping the update batch size fixed. Lower values (e.g., Online-1) correspond to more frequent rollout collection. Fresher rollouts lead to faster convergence and stronger generalization across tasks by better aligning data with the current policy. These findings highlight that rollout quality is multifaceted. Stale or misaligned rollouts can induce collapse, while maintaining freshnessalongside limits on action granularity and sufficient task diversityenables stable and effective RL training. Finding 5: Task diversity, action budget, and rollout frequency affect data quality Diverse task instances enable better policy contrast and generalization across environments. Moderate action budgets provide enough planning space and avoid the noise introduced by overly long sequences. Up-to-date rollouts ensure optimization targets remain aligned with current policy behavior. 4.4. Reasoning Emerges in Single-Turn Tasks but Fails to Grow in Multi-Turn Settings Without Fine-Grained Reward Signals We investigate the role of symbolic reasoning in agent training by comparing its effect in each environment. We find that reasoning notably improves generalization in single-turn tasks like Bandit, but fails to grow or persist in more complex, multi-step environments like Sokoban. Below, we analyze these effects step-by-step. Reasoning traces improve symbolic generalization in single-turn Bandit tasks. We design controlled generalization test in symbolic bandit environments, where each arm is associated with name and distinct reward distribution. In the Bandit setting, the model is trained on [Teacher, Engineer] and evaluated on disjoint set [Librarian, Trader], while preserving intuitive risk-reward alignments (e.g., more ambitious professions map to higher risk and reward). In contrast, the BanditRev setting inverts these associations, assigning 13 Figure 11 Reasoning length over training iterations across different tasks. We track the average token count of reasoning segments (<think> blocks) during RL training. Across all environments, reasoning length declines as training progresses, with BanditRev maintaining longer tracespossibly due to greater semantic-reward conflict requiring more deliberation. counter-intuitive reward profiles (e.g., Librarian = high-risk, high-reward), making semantic reasoning more challenging. Despite the added difficulty in BanditRev, models trained with explicit reasoning supervisionvia <think> tokensconsistently outperform those without, as shown in Table 4. This suggests that reasoning traces help the agent internalize symbolic-reward associations and generalize beyond surface-level memorization, even under semantic-reward misalignment. In multi-turn tasks, reasoning signals fade as training progresses. In contrast, for tasks like Sokoban and FrozenLake, reasoning provides limited benefit. Even when responses are structured to include <think> segments, removing reasoning from prompts (no-think variant) results in comparable or even better performance. To understand this phenomenon, we analyze the average response length across tasks and settings. As shown in Figure 11, reasoning length consistently declines during trainingindicating that the model gradually suppresses its own thought processes. Interestingly, in BanditRev, where semantic labels and reward structures are misaligned, reasoning traces tend to be longersuggesting the agent expends more effort reconciling symbolic cues with observed rewards. Reward signals in multi-turn tasks may be too noisy to reliably support fine-grained reasoning learning. We hypothesize that reasoning collapse in multi-turn settings stems not only from limited supervision, but also from the structure of the reward landscape. In such environments, reward signals are often sparse, delayed, and outcome-basedmaking it difficult to distinguish between successful trajectories driven by coherent reasoning and those achieved through trialand-error. We observe instances where models generate incoherent or hallucinated reasoning yet still arrive at the correct answer. This raises an important challenge: how can we consistently reinforce useful reasoning when the reward alone may not reflect its quality? One possible approach is to decouple action correctness from reasoning quality. Inspired by GRPO, we apply format-based penalties: when the model fails to produce valid <think><answer> structures, we reduce the rewardeven if the final 14 answer is correct. This encourages the model to maintain interpretable reasoning traces and avoid collapsing into shortcut policies. We believe future work could explore reward designs that directly reinforce intermediate reasoning stepsrewarding partial correctness or trajectory-level explanation qualityrather than relying solely on trajectory-level outcome-based reward feedback. Finding 6: Reasoning fails to emerge without meticulous reward design While symbolic reasoning can emerge in simple, single-turn tasks under weak supervision, it fails to persist in multi-turn environments without the reward design explicitly encouraging interpretable intermediate reasoning steps. We observe that even with structured prompts, reasoning gradually decays during training if the reward signal focuses only on final outcomes. This suggests that without meticulous reward shaping, agents may tend to collapse into shortcut behaviors that bypass reasoning altogether. 5. Related Work Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in LLMs. Reinforcement learning (RL) on LLMs (Chen et al., 2021; Christiano et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022) has significantly improved LLMs reasoning capabilities. Notable approaches include the use of Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) which maintains training stability while enhancing performance by clipping policy updates, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (DeepSeekAI et al., 2025) for enhancing the ability of systematic problem-solving, soft actor-critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018) leverages an entropy-regularized objective to promote robust exploration and stability, and meta tokens (Goyal et al., 2024; Herel and Mikolov, 2024; Pfau et al., 2024) for structured thinking. Other significant developments include Process Reward Model (PRM) (Lightman et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2025) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based approaches (Hao et al., 2023a) for systematic problem-solving. On the other hand, recent advances in LLM reasoning have explored techniques to enable models to generate intermediate chain-of-thought rationales. In particular, STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022) iteratively leverages small set of rationale examples along with large dataset without rationales. DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), Dr. GRPO (Liu et al., 2025), and Open Reasoner Zero (Hu et al., 2025) all demonstrate that minimalist, reproducible RL techniquesfeaturing decoupled clipping, unbiased optimization, and simple reward schemescan significantly enhance LLM reasoning performance. Existing agent frameworks. LLM-based agent architectures have evolved from early reasoningaction frameworks (Lin et al., 2024a; Shinn et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022b) to structured planning approaches (Hao et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023). Multi-agent systems (Chen et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a) are designed for tasks with more complex interactions. Widely used platforms such as OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016) and specialized environments including Sokoban (Junghanns and Schaeffer, 2001), FrozenLake (DellAversana, 2021), and Webshop (Yao et al., 2022a) provide diverse testbeds for evaluating these agents. Moreover, general-purpose systems like HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2024) and other frameworks (Hao et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Zhuang et al., 2023) have enabled broad applications ranging from web navigation (Qi et al., 2025), coding copilot (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024; Jimenez et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b) to embodied tasks (Li et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2024b; Xi et al., 2024). Social interaction capabilities have been advanced through Generative Agents and AgentSims (Lin et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023). Challenges persist in architectural 15 complexity and self-correction (He et al., 2025), especially for diverse, multi-step reasoning tasks (Nguyen et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025). 6. Conclusions and Broad Impact In this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning, when adapted for complex and stochastic environments, can effectively train language agents to reason and act. It marks shift from procedure-heavy, human-supervised learning toward reward-driven training based on verifiable outcomes. This opens up scalable and principled path for building AI systems in domains such as theorem proving, software engineering, scientific discovery, and game playing. Future directions include extending to multi-modal inputs, improving training efficiency, and applying to tasks with complex but checkable objectives."

The general RL objective is: 𝐽 (𝜃) = E𝑠D,𝑎𝜋𝜃 ( 𝑠) [𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎)], (8) where 𝜋𝜃 is the policy, 𝑠 is the input prompt, 𝑎 is the response, and 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎) is the reward function evaluating response quality. Common approaches use reward modeling and policy optimization for RL. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) stabilizes training through probability ratio clipping and advantage estimation (Schulman et al., 2017). The probability ratio is defined as: 𝜌𝑡 (𝜃) = 𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) The PPO objective uses this ratio with clipping: 𝐽𝑃𝑃𝑂(𝜃) = E𝑡 [min(𝜌𝑖 𝐴𝑖, ˆ𝜌𝑖 𝐴𝑖) 𝛽𝐷𝐾𝐿], (9) (10) with probability ratio 𝜌𝑖 = 𝜋𝜃 (𝑜𝑖 𝑞) 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖 𝑞) and clipped ratio ˆ𝜌𝑖 = clip(𝜌𝑖, 1 𝜀, 1 + 𝜀). For advantage estimation, Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2018) computes: 𝐴𝐺 𝐴𝐸 (𝛾,𝜆 ) 𝑡 = 𝑙= (𝛾𝜆)𝑙𝛿𝑡+𝑙 (11) where 𝛿𝑡 = 𝑟𝑡 + 𝛾𝑉 (𝑠𝑡+1) 𝑉 (𝑠𝑡) is the TD error, and (𝛾, 𝜆) control the bias-variance tradeoff. Recently, DeepSeek-R1-Zero implements this paradigm through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), sampling 𝐺 outputs {𝑜𝑖} [consisting of reasoning and actions] for each prompt and optimizes: 𝐽𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂(𝜃) = E𝑞,{𝑜𝑖 } [𝐽𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝(𝜃)], where: 𝐽𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝(𝜃) = 1 𝐺 𝐺 𝑖=1 min(𝜌𝑖 𝐴𝑖, ˆ𝜌𝑖 𝐴𝑖) 𝛽𝐷𝐾𝐿, while mostly similar to Eq. 3, the GRPO advantage is neural-model free and calculated as: 𝐴𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖 mean({𝑟 𝑗}) std({𝑟 𝑗}) . (12) (13) (14) Using rule-based rewards 𝑟𝑖, this pure RL approach demonstrates emergent reasoning behaviors. B. Detailed Experimental Settings B.1. Environments and Tasks We construct minimal yet comprehensive testbed comprising three symbolic environments to evaluate LLM agents across key axes of decision-making complexity. Crucially, these environments are synthetic, controllable, and symbolically structured, decoupled from real-world priors or task-specific conventions. Current models hardly benefit from general-purpose instruction 21 fine-tuning or model scale, with larger models up to 32B also perform poorly without training. It enables fair evaluation of RL learning dynamics from scratch, and allows us to systematically study reasoning emergence, training stability, and generalization in agentic LLMs. Specifically, each environment is designed to stress different capability: Bandits targets reasoning under uncertainty, Sokoban focuses on irreversible long-horizon planning, and Frozen Lake couples planning with probabilistic transitions. Bi-Arm Bandits. We design this environment to evaluate whether agents can form risksensitive hypotheses and revise them based on training. At each step, the agent must choose between two semantically symbolic optionse.g., Dragon vs. Phoenixeach linked to fixed reward distribution (Figure 3). The low-risk arm always returns reward of 0.15, while the high-risk arm samples from 𝐵𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑖(0.25): higher variance, higher expected return. Importantly, the low-risk arm wins more often per trial, even though the high-risk arm is better in expectation. This designed to test reasoning: without inductive bias, models may prefer the lo-arm due to its more frequent success, but reasoning agent must learn to associate symbolic cues (e.g., \"Dragon\") with underlying reward statistics, override misleading short-term signals, and justify high-risk choices based on long-term expected return. We further test this by reversing the symbolic labels to probe agents reasoning under opposed reward systems. Sokoban. We use the puzzle Sokoban (Figure 4a) to study multi-turn agent interaction. The agent must push box to the goal in grid within constrained steps. Unlike standard navigation, Sokoban is irreversible: boxes can only be pushed, not pulled back, which requires the agent to reason ahead to avoid dead-ends. The reward signal encourages efficiency and accuracy: +1 for each box on target, 1 for off-target boxes, +10 upon task completion, and 0.1 per action. Frozen Lake. This environment (Figure 4b) combines long-horizon decision-making with stochastic transitions. The agent navigates grid with slippery tiles; each action succeeds with probability 1/3 and deviates perpendicularly with probability 2/3. The agent should reach the goal without falling into holes. Rewards are sparse: successful trials receive reward of +1, with all others 0. B.2. Training and Evaluation Settings We conduct our experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024), trained via the StarPO variants with maximum of 200 rolloutupdate iterations on NVIDIA H100/A100 GPUs leveraging the veRL * repository. Each rollout consists of 𝐾 = 16 trajectories per environment group, based on prompt size 𝑃 = 8 and maximum 5 interaction turns per episode. Agents are allowed up to 5 actions per turn and 10 actions per episode. The update batch size is 𝐸 = 32, with mini-batch size 4 per GPU. Policy optimization uses GAE with (𝛾 = 1.0, 𝜆 = 1.0) and Adam with ( 𝛽1, 𝛽2) = (0.9, 0.999). We use entropy regularization (𝛽 = 0.001) For experiments with vanilla StarPO we use KL coefficient of 0.001, using the k1 estimation. without KL loss term during training, following (Yu et al., 2025), and track KL post-hoc. We impose format penalty of 0.1 if the agent fails to output valid structured responses (e.g., missing <think> or <answer> tags), encouraging adherence to response conventions. To accelerate rollout generation, we disable enforce_eager and retain the computation graph across prefill and sampling in vLLM. We utilize Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) training strategy for multi-GPU experiments. *https://github.com/volcengine/verl http://joschu.net/blog/kl-approx.html 22 For distributed training, we employ Ray as the multi-processing backend with XFORMERS attention implementation. For evaluation, we choose fixed 256 input prompts per environment and decode using temperature 𝑇=0.5, sampling stochastically to better capture robustness in agent behaviors. Episode truncation occurs after 5 turns or 10 total actions. B.3. Evaluation Metrics To track agent learning dynamics and detect training instabilities, we monitor the following metrics throughout training. Except for the success rate, which is evaluated on fixed validation set, all metrics are computed over on-policy rollouts collected during training and smoothed using exponential moving average (EMA). Average Success Rate. Measures task completion accuracy on fixed set of validation prompts. An episode is considered successful if the agent solves the task (e.g., pulling the high-reward arm in Bandit, pushing all boxes to targets in Sokoban, or reaching the goal in Frozen Lake). Rollout Entropy. Computes the average token-level entropy of sampled responses, capturing the exploration level and policy uncertainty. sharp entropy drop may indicate premature policy convergence or collapse. In-Group Reward Variance. Measures reward standard deviation across rollouts sampled from the same prompt group. High in-group variance reflects diverse behaviors and learning potential; sudden collapse indicates reward homogenization and policy stagnation. Total Response Length. Average number of tokens generated per rollout, measuring the verbosity and reasoning depth of the agent. Fluctuations in length may signal changes in planning style or confidence. Gradient Norm. ℓ2 norm of the policy gradient vector, used as proxy for training stability. Spikes often correlate with phase transitions in policy behavior or unstable reward signals. These metrics provide complementary views of policy quality, update dynamics, and reasoning behavior, helping diagnose when and why agent training succeeds or fails. C. Comparing agent RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning Apart from StarPO for RL training, we also employ Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) as another agent training approach, evaluating it on the Sokoban and Frozen Lake task. We employ LoRA with rank of 64 and an alpha value of 32, targeting all linear layers in the model. The SFT process uses learning rate of 1e-4 with training batch size of 128. We generate ground-truth trajectory data through breadth-first search (BFS), setting maximum depth of 100 to create 1,000 training samples and 100 test samples. For SFT, we structure the multi-turn interaction as conversational format. At each turn, the model must generate the next action from the ground-truth trajectory, encapsulating its response within <answer> </answer> tags to maintain format consistency. We analyze the comparative performance of SFT against our stable RL baseline StarPO-S. SFT achieves 74.6% and 23% performance on Sokoban and Frozen Lake, respectively, Compared to the 20.3% and 21.8% performance with StarPO-S. The results indicate that SFT demonstrates superior performance to RL approaches. We draw conclusions from the results that although rule-based RL show promise for agent tasks, there is still need to build more scalable and effective agent RL algorithms to achieve human-comparable performance with solely model self-evolution. D. Efficient Training Motivation. While the main body of the paper reports results obtained by full-parameter finetuning, in practice such setting may be prohibitive when scaling to larger models or longer-horizon tasks. We therefore implement parameter-efficient variant of RAGEN based on Low-Rank Adaptation (Hu et al., 2021). Performance parity. Despite updating only fraction of the model parameters, LoRA reaches validation success rate comparable to that achieved by full fine-tuning of the entire network for the SimpleSokoban task, achieving approximately 0.2% success rate on the validation set. Resource savings. We compare the hardware footprint of LoRA with full fine-tuning. Across an 80-minute training horizon we measure: GPU memory. LoRA stabilizes at 23% of device memory versus 48% for full updates, cutting the peak allocation by >50 %. GPU utilization. Average GPU utilization drops from 34% to 14%. Power consumption. Mean power draw decreases from 22% to 12%, 45% reduction. Take-aways. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning provides practically viable alternative for RAGEN: it attains comparable policy quality while more than halving memory, compute, and power demands. Consequently, future work that scales StarPO to larger backbones or longer contexts can adopt LoRA (or other adapter-based methods) as the default optimization strategy without re-engineering the training loop.

PPO Failure Mode in Frozen Lake Among the three evaluated environments, we observe an interesting divergence on Frozen Lake: PPO tends to collapse earlier or converge less stably than GRPO. This contrasts with the general trend where PPO demonstrates better performance, prompting further analysis. One possible explanation lies in the environments long-horizon stochasticity. In Frozen Lake, agent actions always lead to highly non-deterministic transitions, and intermediate states can appear similar while leading to very different outcomes. This makes value estimation challenging. As PPO relies on learned value function, instability in critic learning may amplify optimization noise and contribute to early collapse. GRPO, by contrast, does not rely on explicit value learning. Its reward-weighted update procedure may be more tolerant to uncertainty in these settings, leading to comparatively more stable training on Frozen Lakeeven if it remains less effective in other tasks. Overall, we summarize environments with high stochasticity may pose greater challenges for value-based methods, and that critic-free approaches can serve as useful baseline in such cases. Frozen Lake Insight: Critic-free methods may offer robustness under uncertainty On Frozen Lake, PPO underperforms GRPO, potentially due to value estimation difficulties in highly stochastic and sparse-reward setting. GRPOs critic-free structure may offer greater tolerance to such conditions. 26 G. Generalization Evaluation Environments To evaluate generalization beyond the training distribution, we design two new test environments besides the three training environments that vary along different axes: SokobanDifferentGridVocab modifies the visual vocabulary used to represent the grid. Instead of using the standard symbols (#, _, O, X, etc.), it maps grid cells to new vocabulary such as W, G, C, etc. This tests whether the model generalizes across symbol variations while retaining underlying spatial semantics. LargerSokoban increases the grid size from 6 6 to 8 8 and the number of boxes from 1 to 2, introducing greater spatial complexity and longer-horizon planning demands. This setting evaluates whether the policy trained on small puzzles can scale up to more complex configurations. These environments are not seen during training and serve to probe the agents generalization capability under symbol shift, size scaling, and environment shift, respectively."
