            "content": "All that one achieves and all that one fails to achieve is the direct result of their own thoughts. James Allen (As Man Thinketh) Recent advancements in building large language models (LLMs) have shifted the focus towards developing models capable of complex multi-step reasoning (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a, OpenAI, 2024). While initial work on LLMs focused on eliciting reasoning using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022, Zhou et al. 2023), we see fundamental shift where reasoning is embedded into models such that they reason before they arrive at an answer. We call this class of models Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and refer to their reasoning chains as thoughts.1 LRMs generate thoughts step-by-step that can accumulate progress towards solution, self-verify, or explore alternative approaches until the model is confident about final answer. Figure 1.1 shows comparison of the outputs of an LLM versus an LRM. Although the output of the LLM can include some intermediate reasoning steps, there is often no exploration. Furthermore, if the model fails, it is unable to backtrack and explore alternatives. In contrast, LRMs reason via exploring and verifying multiple solutions, and concludes with summary of the best explored solution. Progress in LRMs has been mainly driven by reinforcement learning where thought processes yielding correct answers are rewarded over other approaches (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a, Kazemnejad et al., 2024, Kumar et al., 2024, Lambert, 2024, OpenAI, 2024, Shao et al., 2024). The ability of these models to produce long reasoning chains can be exploited at test time, process known as inference-time scaling or test-time scaling: forcing the model to think longer, in the hope that longer thinking leads to better answers (Muennighoff et al., 2025, Snell et al., 2025). Driven by these advancements, we have seen significant improvements in LRM performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex reasoning such as mathematical problem-solving and code generation. While OpenAIs o1 (OpenAI, 2024) was the first model to demonstrate the tremendous potential of LRMs, OpenAI made neither its reasoning chains nor the training recipe accessible. This prevented the wider research community from studying reasoning in LRMs more deeply, and elicited speculation on the training process (Rush and Ritter, 2025). The arrival of DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a), therefore, created significant impact, being highly-capable LRM that not only rivals o1s performance, but also in computationally efficient manner. DeepSeek-R1 is particularly exciting for the following reasons: (i) It is the first highly capable LRM that provides access to its thoughts for given input2; (ii) The training procedure along with code and weights of the trained model are publicly available (though not the training data); and (iii) DeepSeek-R1s preliminary variant, R1-Zero, shows that strong reasoning capabilities with complex multi-step reasoning, self-verification, and seemingly spontaneous insights (also referred to as aha moments), can be discovered purely from reinforcement learning and do not need to be explicitly taught via supervised learning. The transparent access to DeepSeek-R1s thoughts allows us to systematically study its reasoning behavior, an endeavor we term Thoughtology. Within the scope of thoughtology, we analyze the common reasoning patterns in DeepSeek-R1s thoughts, the effects and controllability of thought length, the effect of long or confusing contexts on these reasoning chains, DeepSeekR1s tendencies in terms of safety and cultural behaviour, and similarities with human language processing and world modeling. Figure 1 shows an overview of our study, which provides first 1Through this paper, we use the terms thought and reasoning chain interchangeably; we note, however, that this does not mean we assume reasoning chains are akin to human thoughts. 2Google has recently released Gemini 2.5, which also makes reasoning chains accessible, though neither its weights nor its training recipe are public. step towards better understanding of the limitations of DeepSeek-R1s capabilities and serves to guide research more appropriately to improve reasoning. Our primary findings of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning are: DeepSeek-R1s thoughts follow consistent structure. After determining the problem goal, it decomposes the problem towards an interim solution. It will then either re-explore or re-verify the solution multiple times before completion, though these re-verifications can lack in diversity. Continuously scaling length of thoughts does not necessarily increase performance. There exists problem-specific optimal reasoning length, beyond which performance declines. Moreover, we find that DeepSeek-R1 is not capable of modulating the length of its own thoughts. When context information contradicts parametric knowledge, DeepSeek-R1 willingly prioritizes context information over its parametric knowledge. But when the input context or reasoning chain becomes too long, it behaves erratically, often getting overwhelmed and producing nonsensical text. DeepSeek-R1 exhibits higher safety vulnerabilities compared to its non-reasoning counterpart DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025b). We also show that the models reasoning capabilities can be used to generate jailbreak attacks that successfully elicit harmful responses from safety-aligned LLMs. When presented with moral or cultural questions, DeepSeek-R1 reasons for significantly longer when prompted in English than when prompted in Chinese. It also provides different responses, displaying different sets of cultural values in each language. When presented sentences that humans find difficult to process, DeepSeek-R1 also generates longer reasoning chains. However, it also exhibits very non-humanlike behaviour for simple control sentences. While DeepSeek-R1 can identify important subcomponents in visual and physical reasoning tasks that relate to world modeling, it fails to properly combine this information or to iterate over drafts."

            "title": "1.1 Organization of this work",
            "content": "We divide this work into five broad categories: (i) the general structure and patterns of model thoughts; (ii) the effects and controllability of thought length; (iii) model behavior in demanding contexts; (iv) safety and cultural concerns; and (v) comparisons of reasoning chains to human cognitive phenomena. We provide high-level overview of our study in Figure 1. Patterns of thought DeepSeek-R1 is the first LRM to provide open-access to its reasoning chains, enabling systematic study of its decision-making process. To understand this reasoning behaviour in context, we go over brief background on previous attempts for building LRMs and DeepSeek-R1 specifically (Section 2). We then analyze the reasoning patterns of DeepSeek-R1 in detail in Section 3 and identify recurring structures in the models internal reasoning process. We find that DeepSeek-R1s thoughts consistently follow clear structure, comprised of unique phases. These include problem definition, followed by decomposition of the problem, and then repeated reconstruction cycles before final answer. We find that DeepSeek-R1s long reasoning processes stem from frequent reconstruction steps that often explore novel problem reconstructions in the initial stages of thought, and otherwise re-examine previously considered constructions of the problem: process we call rumination. 5 Figure 1.1: Comparing the response of Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4o against the response of Large Reasoning Model (LRM) like DeepSeek-R1 for simple math reasoning problem. The LLM generates chain-of-thought pursuing single approach to solve the problem without any verification of the answer. In contrast, the LRM carefully thinks about the problem from different perspectives while continuously validating its approach. Scaling and controlling thought length We analyze the impact of length of thoughts on model performance for math reasoning tasks in Section 4. We find that there exists sweet spot of reasoning for each problem: an optimal range of thoughts for which the performance is highest. Thoughts that are longer than this optimal range have substantially lower accuracy. Additionally, we explore trade-offs between generating longer reasoning steps and corresponding improvements in task performance; we find that DeepSeek-R1 is inherently inefficient and enforcing token budget can significantly reduce costs with only minimal impact on performance. Later, in Section (Section 11), we analyze the extent to which DeepSeek-R1 can adhere to reasoning token budgets in the prompt, and then present proof-of-concept study in which we explore different formulations of rewards for thinking within specified token budgets. We find that DeepSeek-R1 struggles to adhere to thought token budgets specified in the prompt; our proof-of-concept study, however, also suggests that trade-offs between budget compliance and accuracy exist when explicitly training models to respect budget limits. Long and confusing contexts We then bring DeepSeek-R1 into more real world use-cases by examining its handling of contextual information. In Section 5, we look at DeepSeek-R1s capacity to process large amounts of text, both in the input as well as its own generated thoughts. 6 We observe that, although DeepSeek-R1 performs well, it is slightly less effective in long-context scenarios compared to state-of-the-art LLMs. We also note that the model occasionally becomes overwhelmed by increasingly long contexts, even within its own reasoning chains, and outputs incoherent responses. In Section 6, we investigate how DeepSeek-R1 adapts to spurious user input that may induce conflicts with its parametric knowledgesuch as incorrect or distracting datain questionanswering and in-context learning tasks. While DeepSeek-R1 acknowledges contradictions to its knowledge in its reasoning chains, it will typically adapt to user input, if relevant to the task; this comes at the cost of efficiency, as the model will spend compute time deliberating over user intentions. Safety and cultural behavior We further investigate DeepSeek-R1s reasoning processes in the context of safety and cultural behaviour. In Section 7, we investigate its capacity to output harmful information as well as its capacity to jailbreak other models. We find that, relative to other models, including its non-reasoning counterpart V3, DeepSeek-R1 is not only more prone to output harmful information, but also adept at jailbreaking other LLMs. In Section 8, we investigate DeepSeek-R1s moral and cultural reasoning capabilities across languages (English, Chinese and Hindi). We discuss differences in DeepSeek-R1s thoughts when prompted in Chinese versus English, and find initial evidence that the model reasons longer in English than in Chinese, and also presents different cultural values when prompted in the different languages we test. LRMs and cognitive phenomena In Section 9, we investigate correlations between human language processing and DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains, using two types of challenging sentences from psycholinguistics: garden-path sentences and comparative illusions. While DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chain lengths align with sentence difficulty in manner strongly reminiscent of human cognition, their structure raises skepticism, particularly the models tendency to engage in excessive, looping reasoning for control prompts. In Section 10, we then push further on these comparisons, and evaluate DeepSeek-R1 on its world modeling capacities, via visual and physical reasoning. Looking into reasoning chains when the model is prompted to produce ASCII art of objects and physical simulations, we find that it is heavily reliant on symbolic and mathematical reasoning even for fairly intuitive tasks, and does not display consistent or iterative reasoning process for these tasks. Conclusions We summarize and conclude our investigations in Section 12. While DeepSeekR1 demonstrates impressive reasoning capabilities, it leaves open several future avenues for further development. These include more control over thought length and contents, more consistent and faithful reasoning strategies, and improvements on safety concerns."

            "content": "LLMs are often portrayed as System 1 thinkers, prone to quick judgements and biases (Li et al., 2025); thus, it has been an active field of research to distil deliberate System 2 reasoning ability into LLMs. Early approaches attempted to explicitly instil reasoning behaviour into language models via explanations in training data (Nye et al., 2022, Rajani et al., 2019, Yu et al., 2023). However, these methods require large amounts of human-annotated data, making them an expensive avenue. Training-free approaches Simply prompting the model to think step-by-step towards solution showed great success in eliciting strong reasoning behaviour, known as Chain-ofThought (CoT) prompting (Kojima et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2022). Given the risk of error accumulation through improper reasoning paths, previous works have either attempted to instill self-verification steps into the process (Li et al., 2023, Weng et al., 2023), or sampled across diverse reasoning paths run in parallel to find consistent answers (Fu et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2023b). While methods such as CoT explore proofs in the forward direction, prior work has also explored backward chaining from conclusion (Kazemi et al., 2023). Another line of research guided LLMs to follow certain problem solving paradigms, for e.g., by prompting with algorithm examples (Zhou et al., 2022) or specific approaches to facilitate problem decomposition (Perez et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2023). Training-based approaches By using self-generated CoT rationales as training signal, LLMs have been shown to be able to iteratively develop their own reasoning capabilities (Zelikman et al., 2022). Most modern work in instilling reasoning behaviour in LLMs use RL or self-training based procedures, which rely on reward signals to train the model to develop reasoning processes. These rewards can be for the final model outcome (Pang et al., 2024, Singh et al., 2024, Zelikman et al., 2022) or for specific steps in the models reasoning (Wan et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024a). While the majority of these approaches rely on CoT-like reasoning (Pang et al., 2024, Trung et al., 2024, Zelikman et al., 2022), other types of reasoning have been explored (Hao et al., 2024, Wan et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024a). Crucial for the generalisable success of these methods is the development of suitable reward model (Trung et al., 2024, Yeo et al., 2025), efficient implementation (Noukhovitch et al., 2025, Schulman et al., 2017, Shao et al., 2024, Silver et al., 2016) and strong base models (Gandhi et al., 2025). These innovations have enabled modern LRMs like DeepSeek-R1, o1, Claude 3.7, and Gemini 2.5 to exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities, though the implementation details for these models except DeepSeek-R1 are unknown (Anthropic, 2025a, DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a, Google, 2025, OpenAI, 2024)."

To guide the reasoning process of the model, DeepSeek-R1-Zero uses system prompt (shown in Table 1) which constrains its generations to specific reasoning format. The model is trained on reasoning data from unknown sources using GRPO(Shao et al., 2024) and symbolic rewards based on the accuracy and format of its generations. Notably, DeepSeek-AI et al. report that the average response length and downstreamperformance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero increases as training progresses. They further report an aha moment during training, which refers to the emergence of the models ability to reconsider its previously generated content. As we show in Section 3.2, this reconsideration behaviour is often indicated by the generation of phrases such as wait, ... or alternatively, ...."

User: {{{prompt}}}. Assistant: Table 1: System prompt used during training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Cold start via SFT The first training phase consisted of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large collection of CoT data collected from different sources.3 Importantly, the CoT data also contains reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero which was carefully filtered and post-hoc corrected (by human annotators) (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a). Reasoning fine-tuning via GRPO The next training stage further fine-tunes the SFT model from the previous step using GRPO. The authors note that they apply the same RL training process which was used for DeepSeek-R1-Zero but additionally introduce language reward to avoid language mixing in the models generations. The data used for this stage of training remains unknown. Re-start with SFT The model resulting from the first two training stages was used to generate an SFT training set consisting of approximately 600.000 training instances which demonstrate reasoning behaviour. The authors state that they used extensive filtering when collecting this data set and added another 200.000 non-reasoning training instances to improve the diversity of this dataset. The next training phase now consists of training for 2 epochs on these 800.000 training instances using SFT. Notably, training in this stage starts anew from DeepSeek-V3-base and not the the checkpoint from the first two training phases. RL for all scenarios The final phase of training is another round of RL fine-tuning via GRPO. This training stage is performed on diverse distribution of prompts to improve the helpfulness and harmlessness of the model (safety training) as well as to further refine its reasoning abilities. This phase of training uses mixture of rule-based (for math, code, and logical reasoning data) and learned reward models (for general data)."

Several parts of this pipeline make heavy use of synthetic training data generated from previous stages of the training process. While only few details about DeepSeek-R1s exact training data are available, is it likely that this data was heavily filtered and some of it even post-hoc corrected to exhibit certain reasoning patterns (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a). When discussing the human-likeliness of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning patterns, it is hence important to consider the possibility that these patterns are strongly influenced by data curation and SFT, and not just the result of DeepSeek-R1 re-discovering patterns that mimic human reasoning."

In this section, we systematically analyse these chains to uncover their role in the models reasoning process. This analysis provides foundation for later sections, where we examine in more detail how these reasoning chains impact model performance and reveal potential limitations. We first outline typical human reasoning behaviour in Section 3.1. We then define the core building blocks of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains in Section 3.2, where we outline key differences between human and DeepSeek-R1 processes.

            "content": "Across various reasoning paradigms (Polya, 1954, Wang and Chiew, 2010), we see some shared terminology and stages in human reasoning processes. We highlight these steps here to motivate our decomposition of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning processes. We can then use these definitions to compare the mechanisms underlying both and highlight important similarities and differences. 1. Problem Definition: First, one must simplify the relevant details of the task representation to identify the pertinent given, and foreknown information as well as the missing, unknown information to be determined (Ho et al., 2022, Wang and Chiew, 2010). 2. Initial response: Dependent on the complexity of the problem, one may appropriate solution to an analogous problem or rely on an heuristics-based approach to give an immediate answer (Weisberg, 2015). This may be analogous to System 1 thinking (Kahneman, 2011). 3. Planning: In the case of difficult problems, strategic, analytical approach may be chosen. The complexity of this plan depends on the complexity of the task representation (Correa et al., 2023). There are many possible approaches to problem: for example, one may choose to break large task into smaller sub-tasks, or hill-climb by incrementally progressing to desired goal (Wang and Chiew, 2010). 4. Execution and Monitoring: Throughout execution of this plan, humans monitor their own confidence in their progress to determine if the plan needs to be readjusted. Better monitoring suggests better final performance on the task (Ackerman and Thompson, 2017). 5. Reconstruction: Ones initial approach or world assumptions may need to be modified during the solving process (Stuyck et al., 2021). This may be either to resolve impasses due to errors in the problem representation (Knoblich et al., 1999) or when flagged by conscious self-monitoring processes noted above (Macgregor et al., 2001). 6. Solution verification: After either heuristics or strategy-based approach, humans typically reflect on their approach and their solution to ensure it meets the constraints of the given problem (Prabawanto, 2019)."

While DeepSeek-R1 separates reasoning steps with line breaks, these do not consistently align with discrete units of thought. To address this, we manually inspect reasoning chains to identify their recurring patterns, and create taxonomy to facilitate discussion of the underlying processes. Our analysis leads to the following breakdown of the reasoning process, which we visualise in Figure 3.1 and give concrete annotated example in Figure 3.2: 12 Figure 3.1: sketch of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning process. DeepSeek-R1 begins by defining the task goals in the problem definition stage. Reasoning begins with the bloom cycle, which decomposes the problem to an answer. This may be followed by some number of reconstruction cycles, where the model reconsiders an assumption made. Throughout this time, the model gives some qualification of confidence in its reasoning. Finally, the model determines final answer before closing the reasoning chain. We give an annotated example in Figure 3.2. 1. Problem Definition: The model reformulates the problem."

Blooming Cycle: The first major reasoning cycle, where the model decomposes the problem into subproblems and provides an interim answer. We call this the bloom cycle, as it is typically the longest due to the problem decomposition.

Reconstruction Cycle(s) Subsequent reasoning cycles where the model reconsiders what happened in the blooming cycle, e.g., Wait, Alternatively, Is there another way to interpret this?. It may then provide new interim answer in which it may or may not qualify its confidence. This step may repeat multiple times. 4. Final Decision: The model reaches its final answer, indicated by phrases like think Im confident now... and gives the final answer. Comparison to humans We note some key differences between human reasoning and that of DeepSeek-R1. Although both processes begin with problem definition step, this stage is somewhat more formalised in human processes, as the model only explicitly defines the unknown missing information in its formulation statement. As reasoning is typically enforced for DeepSeek-R1 (See Section 8 for exceptions), we rarely see the model give heuristics-based initial response, and the reasoning chain instead delves immediately into strategic approach. Rather than stratified plan-execute-reconstruct approach, DeepSeek-R1 plans as it executes (the Bloom cycle); this approach typically also involves some problem decomposition as the model determines underlying subtasks to immediately execute and then reconstruct. The following reconstruction cycles are typically verifications of the interim answer, given various reconsiderations of the initial problem deconstruction. The final decision stage typically only restates the models confidence in its answer before exiting the reasoning process, as verification is completed throughout the reconstruction cycles. While it appears that DeepSeek-R1 qualifies its confidence in its reasoning throughout each cycle, we find that the constant re-examination of 13 recently confidently examined re-considerations (which we show in Section 3.3) does not indicate faithful process monitoring and thus contrasts with the meta-cognitive monitoring process seen in humans. Process annotation To validate this taxonomy, we assess 400 examples across various tasks examined later in this work. We prompt GPT-4o with the manually identified rules and human-annotated few-shot examples to guide its annotations, of which the authors of this paper manually inspected to ensure adequate annotation. We provide the full prompt in Appendix B. We annotate 100 examples for each of the four key tasks analyzed in later sections: mathematical capabilities (Section 4), context faithfulness (Section 6), response to psycholinguistic stimuli (grammatically confusing sentences, further explained in Section 9), and harmful question-answering (Section 7).

First, let me parse the problem. fiber and half that much white fiber. fiber is another part. need to find the total number of bolts needed for both. Alright, so let me break it down. blue and white. It gives me the quantity for blue fiber first: Then, for white fiber, it says half that much. Hmm, half that much of what? think it means half of the blue fibers amount. So, if blue fiber is 2 bolts, then half of that would be 2 divided by 2, Therefore, the total number of bolts which is 1. So, white fiber is 1 bolt. That gives me 3 bolts in total. would be blue plus white, which is 2 plus 1. Wait, let me make sure Im not making mistake here. The problem says \"half that much white fiber.\" So, \"that much\" refers to the blue fiber, right? So, if blue is 2, then half of blue is 1. 3. That seems straightforward. But, hold on, let me think again. Maybe \"half that much\" could mean half of something else? Let me reread the problem: \"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.\" Hmm, it doesnt specify the total number of fibers or anything else. So, its just blue is 2, white is half of that, so 1. Alternatively, could it be that \"half that much\" is referring to something else, like half of the total? But the sentence structure doesnt support that. It says \"half that much white fiber,\" with \"that much\" referring back to the blue fiber. So, yeah, 2 is the amount of blue, white is half of that, so 1. Total is 3. think Im confident now. bolts in total. So, the answer should be 3. **Final Answer** The total number of bolts needed is 3. </think> So, 2 bolts of blue and 1 bolt of white make 3 Is there another way to interpret this? So, 2 + 1 is indeed So, white is 1. Total is 3. The problem states that robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. 1. The amount of blue fiber needed is 2 bolts. 2. The amount of white fiber needed is half of the blue fiber: 2 2 = 1 bolt. 3. Adding the blue and white fibers together gives the total number of bolts: 2 + 1 = 3. Thus, the total number of bolts needed is 3 Figure 3.2: Annotated reasoning chain of GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) example. We colour the steps according to their stage, as defined in Section 3.2. Furthermore, we highlight the consistent reconsiderations the model makes, in reference to the initial deconstruction of the problem during the Bloom cycle. We term this repeated reconsideration rumination. Figure 3.3: Time spent in the stages of reasoning (as introduced in Section 3.2) across four different investigated tasks.

Time spent per stage We plot the general time spent in various stages across our four investigated tasks in Figure 3.3. The average length of each reasoning chain differs greatly across the task type (typically more time is spent reasoning for mathematical and grammatical tasks, and less time is spent reasoning for the contextual adaptation and safety QA task). However, the time spent in problem definition is equivalent across all tasks. While the context faithfulness task spends less time in the bloom stage, the main difference between the observed tasks rests in the reconstruction cycles; these tasks mainly differ in the amount of time DeepSeekR1 spends deliberating over its previous conclusions. We investigate this deliberation further in the following analyses. Length of reasoning cycles We look into the lengths of each preceding reasoning cycle, starting from the bloom cycle (Cycle 0) and the following reconstruction cycles, if present. In Figure 3.4, we present the data for mathematical reasoning, as it is the task with the longest reasoning chains and the greatest number of cycles, but we show the graphs for the other four tasks in Appendix B. We note an interesting behaviour: typically, the bloom cycle is the longest cycle, which is conserved across nearly all tasks (context faithfulness is one exception, which we discuss in the Appendix). Typically, we see decrease in cycle length over reasoning time. However, approximately every 5 reconstructions, we see longer reconstruction cycle. We note that there is lot of variance across question and dataset, as these long reconstruction cycles do not appear consistently every 5 cycles. Rather, it seems that long reconstruction cycles are most common directly after the bloom step, and then re-emerge periodically as reasoning progress. 16 Figure 3.4: The length of each reasoning cycle (Bloom and Reconstruction cycles) for the mathematical reasoning tasks.

Now Im getting Figure 3.5: We show more complicated reasoning chain from MATH-500 (we have redacted components with [...] to simplify the reasoning). We use darker purple to highlight longer cycles, and lighter colors to indicate shorter cycles. We highlight the different problem decompositions the model makes. Firstly, we indicate the initial problem decomposition, and highlight two changes the model makes to this decomposition in orange and yellow. In the longer cycles, we see some re-blooms, or novel decompositions of the problem. Shorter cycles typically re-verify these previous decompositions (See frequent call back to one particular decomposition in the figure), which we term rumination, or they abandon their line of reasoning (See Cycle 18). We note that the correct answer to this problem is 720. Reconstructions We now take deeper, qualitative look at the longer and shorter reconstruction cycles identified. We imagine these reasoning cycles (both the initial bloom and subsequent reconstruction cycles) function as sequential form of self-consistency sampling(Wang et al., 2023b). We point again to the example in Figure 3.2 and note the reconsiderations considered in each reconstruction. In this example, we see several, similar deliberations over the same assumption made during the Bloom phase. Even after DeepSeek-R1 has checked the same assumption several times, it continues to investigate it. We call this behaviour rumination, as it evokes ruminant regurgitating already chewed cud. We see this behaviour repeated in several tasks seen in the following sections (See Sections 5 and 9). In more complicated tasks, we may see several different ways to reconsider the same initial assumption. We show one example in Figure 3.5. The model takes several ways to reformulate the problem: it initially (correctly) treats the group as single unit. After some cycles, it considers fixing one persons position. It continues comparing these approaches in shorter rumination reconsideration cycles. These smaller cycles also include abandoned reconstructions. In contrast, longer reconstruction cycles typically consider novel way to approach the problem, and follow this line to completion (which may be considered rebloom). Therefore, we can see several behaviours of interest in these reconstruction cycles: (1) long re-blooms of novel reconstructions, which are more common in early reasoning, though periodically appear in later cycles, (2) short ruminations of already examined reconsiderations, and (3) short abandonments of novel reconstructions."

We show that problem definition and final decisions are typically consistent across task, and the major difference in processing time owes to the reconstruction cycles, longer re-bloom reconstructions are more frequent where we see consistent behaviour types: at the start of reasoning, though they may periodically emerge throughout the reasoning chain. In shorter reconstructions, the model often reconsiders already examined decompositions (which can be done multiple times), or may abandon novel decomposition before completion.

This phenomenon was first introduced by OpenAI (2024) and has been exhibited by subsequent reasoning models (Muennighoff et al., 2025) as well. In their paper, DeepSeek-AI et al. (2025a) showed that DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to produce increasingly long reasoning chains through training with reinforcement learning. However, they do not conduct any test-time scaling analysis for R1-Zero or R1, leaving it unclear whether longer reasoning necessarily leads to better performance. While longer chains may allow for more complex reasoning, they may also introduce redundancy or errors. Furthermore, as our analysis in Section 3 suggests, DeepSeek-R1 often undergoes multiple cycles of self-verification, even when it has already arrived at the correct answer. This raises concerns about the efficiency of the models reasoning process: is the increased accuracy worth the computational cost? In this section, we carry out experiments geared towards analyzing the effects of reasoning chain length on performance. In Section 4.1, we analyze the effect of longer thoughts on model performance for mathematical reasoning tasks; in Section 4.2, we extend this analysis to assess the cost-efficiency of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains with respect to performance gains."

We focus on the AIME-24 (MAA, 2024) benchmark and the multi-digit Multiplication task (Dziri et al., 2023). AIME-24 consists of extremely challenging math reasoning problems that have numerical solution. The Multiplication task requires providing the result of multiplying pair of k-digit numbers. We also show additional results for two other math reasoning benchmarks: MATH500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021, Lightman et al., 2023) and GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021). Experimental setup We only experiment with DeepSeek-R1. We consider two experimental setups: (1) studying the performance trend against the length of thoughts, and (2) studying the number of tokens in correct and incorrect thoughts. For the former, we experiment with the AIME-24 and Multiplications task. We set the temperature to 1.0 and the token budget to the maximum possible of 32000 tokens. For each of the 30 problems in AIME-24, we sample = 50 thoughts. For each multiplication task, we have 40 unique pairs of numbers, and for each pair, we sample = 6 reasoning chains. Each reasoning chain is assigned binary result based on the final prediction from that reasoning chain matching the ground-truth answer. We then Figure 4.1: Average accuracy of thoughts present in each bin for 3 different problems in AIME-24. The areas covered by bins representing longer thoughts are shaded with increasingly darker color. 19 Figure 4.2: Average accuracy of thoughts present in each bin for the Multiplication task. We segregate the results into three categories of problems depending on the number of digits being multiplied: small numbers (up to 6 6), medium numbers (7 7 to 1111), and large numbers (larger than 12 12). segregate the model-generated reasoning chains into 5 bins such that each bin contains reasoning chains with broadly similar numbers of thought tokens. For the other experiment, we work with the AIME-24, MATH500, and GSM8k benchmarks. We set the temperature to 0.6 and the token budget to the maximum possible of 32000 tokens. For the 30 problems in AIME-24, we sample = 50 thoughts. For the MATH500 and GSM8k benchmarks, we only sample single thought for each problem. Results Figure 4.1 plots the average accuracy of thoughts present in each bin for 3 different problems in AIME-24; results for all problems are provided in Figure C.1. To measure the overall trend for AIME-24, we min-max normalize the token lengths of thoughts for each problem in 0-1 range before binning, and then plot the average over accuracies for each problem in each bin in Figure 4.4. For the Multiplication task, in Figure 4.2 we plot the average accuracy of thoughts in each bin for each multiplication task and group the results based on the number of digits. Figure 4.3: The average lengths for correct and incorrect thoughts generated by DeepSeekR1 for three math reasoning benchmarks: AIME-24, MATH500, and GSM8k. This trend was first observed for AIME-24 by Dimakis (2025). 20 Figure 4.4: Aggregate of problem-wise average accuracies in each bin when the token lengths of thoughts are normalized in 0-1 range. Figure 4.5: DeepSeek-R1s performance on the GSM8k task when constrained with varying token budgets. In Figure 4.3, we show the average lengths for correct and incorrect thoughts for AIME-24, MATH500, and GSM8k. Discussion For the AIME-24 task shown in Figure 4.1, we identify multiple problems for which DeepSeek-R1s performance increases with the length of thoughts being generated, reaches maximum, and then decreases with longer thought processes. We note that, while this is more prevalent in some problems compared to others, Figure 4.4 shows that this trend holds for the dataset as whole. For the Multiplication task, as Figure 4.2 shows, the model always succeeds irrespective of the length of thoughts when multiplying small numbers (up to 6 6), but, on the other hand almost always fails for large numbers (larger than 12 12). For medium-sized numbers (i.e., 77 to 1111), however, it exhibits the same trend seen for AIME-24: performance increases with the length of thoughts, reaches maximum, and then decreases considerably for extremely long thoughts. These trends are further validated by our results in Figure 4.3, which shows that on average, correct thoughts are much more shorter than incorrect thoughts. Our results are consistent with parallel work (Dimakis, 2025, Qu et al., 2025, Zeng et al., 2025) that highlight difference between the average lengths of thoughts for correct and incorrect solutions for math reasoning tasks. It is surprising to see that overly long thoughts almost always hurt performance. Our hypothesis is that this has two potential causes: (1) the model goes down the wrong path towards solving the problem and then it keeps trying unsuccessfully until it decides to give up, never quite finding the correct approach (as shown in Figure C.2); and (2) the model finds the correct approach and solution but then self-verifies it to be incorrect, eventually outputting different incorrect answer (as shown in Figure C.3). It is important to clarify, however, that these results should not be interpreted as evidence against test-time scaling. Test-time scaling suggests that for problem of some given difficulty, if it cannot be solved using short chains of thought, increasing the length of thoughts may eventually enable the model to arrive at correct solution. Our findings indicate that there exists an optimal range for the length of thoughts specific to each problem. Generating chains of thought that exceed this optimal range will lead to diminished performance, highlighting the potential limitations of unrestricted length scaling."

This capability is particularly critical for LRMsnot only because these models will often be deployed in scenarios requiring the processing of extensive contexts, but also because, as we observe in Sections 3, 4 and 10 (see also DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a), reasoning chains themselves are often thousands of tokens long, further adding to the context length.

This task assesses surface-level long-context retrieval abilities without requiring any reasoning. We then use GPT23 4o (OpenAI Team et al., 2024) to generate set of 100 personalised facts, that are not common knowledge. Each fact is then placed in unique 120k token-long context created by randomly sampling documents from the CHASE-QA task (Patel et al., 2025).

Both these benchmarks simulate realistic applications requiring reasoning over large amounts of text. Experimental setup The CHASE-QA task requires reasoning over information presented in multiple long documents with an average context length of 6k tokens per example. We evaluate DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 on test set consisting of 200 CHASE-QA examples chosen randomly. The CHASE-Code task requires reasoning over long repositories of code with an average context length of 17k tokens per example. We evaluate the model on 100 randomly selected examples from the algorithms split of CHASE-Code."

Results and discussion Table 2 shows our results. For the CHASE-QA task, we observe that reasoning-focused training helps DeepSeek-R1 perform much better than DeepSeek-V3. However, its performance is still significantly lower than other non-reasoning frontier LLMs like Gemini-1.5-Pro (Gemini Team et al., 2024), which is known to particularly excel at handling long-context tasks. On manual examination, we observe that large portion of the errors made by DeepSeek-R1 are cases of incomplete answer generation, as illustrated in Figure D.1. For CHASE-Code, we again observe that while DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3 by large margin, its performance is still marginally lower than the SOTA Gemini-1.5-Pro (Gemini Team et al., 2024), which is not reasoning-based model. This observation is consistent with DeepSeek-AI et al. (2025a), who also observed that DeepSeek-R1 performs similar to nonreasoning SOTA LLMs on SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024), another repository-level code benchmark. These results seem to indicate that enhanced reasoning ability does not significantly help model reason over large repositories of code.

Here, we ask whether DeepSeek-R1 can, at the end of reasoning chain, still recall information that it generates early on in the reasoning process. One potential experimental setup for answering this question is to instruct DeepSeek-R1 to generate some random fact, then generate an extremely long (around 30k tokens) context of information on various random topics, and then restate the original fact. However, as we show 25 in Figure D.3 and again in Section 11.1, it is very difficult to instruct DeepSeek-R1 to output specific number of tokens. Therefore, we prompted DeepSeek-R1 with 10 randomly selected AIME (Veeraboina, 2023) problems and asked the model to first choose random historical fact, then solve the AIME questions (which will indirectly cause long reasoning chain), and then restate the chosen historical fact. An example is provided in Figure D.4. When tested over 50 such instances, we find that the DeepSeek-R1 does not follow the instruction of first generating fact for 30% of the examples. For the remaining cases where it does generate fact before starting to solve the math problems, the model succeeds in recalling the fact nearly 85% of the time. The failures include the model not recalling the fact or being overwhelmed and starting to generate gibberish text, similar to what we observed in Section 5.1 (example provided in Figure D.5)."

These results are consistent with parallel works investigating DeepSeek-R1s abilities in long-context settings (Gao et al., 2025, Kim et al., 2025, Maekawa et al., 2025).

The question of faithfulness becomes particularly important when considering knowledge conflicts: cases where information in the context provided to the model is not line with the models parametric knowledge (Marjanovic et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2024, Xu et al., 2024). The arrival of reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 raise new possibilities in this space, as they allow us to not only study how knowledge conflicts are ultimately resolved by new class of models, but also look into resolution processes in their reasoning chains. In this section, we explore how DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 follow user instructions and adapt to user intents, which may be misleading, incorrect, or inconsistent with the models semantic priors, in order to assess models faithfulness and reliance on user-provided context. We present quantitative and qualitative results of the models reasoning output given correct, incorrect, and distracting pieces of knowledge (Section 6.1), as well as mislabelled in-context few-shot examples (Section 6.2).

Experimental setup To measure DeepSeek-R1s faithfulness to incorrect or irrelevant information, we use gpt-4o-mini OpenAI Team et al. (2024) to generate (i) factually incorrect passages and corresponding answers, and (ii) distracting and factually irrelevant passages, to 100 NaturalQuestions (NQ) questions Kwiatkowski et al. (2019). We then use these factually incorrect passages and factually irrelevant passages in our prompts to the model. Following Adlakha et al. (2024), for cases involving incorrect passages, we evaluate model responses in terms of recall : whether the reference answer appears in the models response and contrast this against the models recall given factually correct passages (taken from the original NQ dataset). On the other hand, to evaluate model behavior given an irrelevant passage (for which there is no reference answer within the context to the question), we observe the proportion of responses in which the model refuses to answer (e.g. by responding with dont know).

We find that DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 perform quite similar, both being faithful to the users incorrect input in the majority of cases (78% respectively). This recall score is actually higher than in cases where the model is provided correct information. Meanwhile, when provided with irrelevant information, both models almost always defer to refusal, i.e, (I dont know). 27 Analyzing DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains, however, gives us far more insight into the models knowledge resolution process. Figure 6.1 shows an example in which the model is provided factually incorrect information, and adheres to it in its response. While the model does eventually favour the factually incorrect response provided, it explicitly acknowledges the knowledge conflict in its reasoning chain, and explicitly defers to the users provided information. Similarly, as Figure E.7 (an instance where the model outputs factually correct answer despite an irrelevant passage) shows, DeepSeek-R1 is able to identify that an irrelevant provided passage does not help answer the question.

In this section, we assess whether DeepSeek-R1 can adapt to mislabelled few-shot in-context examples for given task. Prior works (Min et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023a, Wei et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024b) have carried out extensive experiments to better understand the role of few-shot examples for in-context learning in LLMs; here, we focus on the experimental setup of Wei et al. (2024) to evaluate whether DeepSeek-R1 is capable of overriding its semantic priors and predicting the context-faithful label for sentiment classification task, when provided with mislabelled few-shot examples. Experimental setup We provide varying percentages of mislabelled in-context examples for the SST-2 sentiment classification task (Socher et al., 2013). We randomly sample 100 examples to form our test set. We provide 16 in-context examples for each label randomly sampled anew from the train set for each test example. We do not provide any instruction about the task; the prompt simply consists of the in-context examples as concatenation of Input: [x] Output: [y] examples. We measure the accuracy according to the original label on our test set.

We also provide the average length of the models reasoning chains for each setting. Results Table 5 shows the results of our analysis. We see that accuracy on the task falls sharply as the proportion of deliberately mislabelled examples increases. This indicates that similar to our previous findings DeepSeek-R1 is highly capable of over-riding its parametric knowledge to adhere to information in the context. We also find that DeepSeek-R1 produces longer reasoning chains when presented with high proportion of mislabelled examples, presumably because the model is conflicted about its priors. Furthermore, reasoning chain length appears to peak when 75% of in-context examples are mislabelled, before dropping again when all examples are mislabelledsuggesting that reasoning chains are longest when the in-context labels largely contradict the models parametric knowledge, but minority of labels prevent consistently wrong set of labels. Upon manual inspecting some of these reasoning chains, we also find evidence of some reasoning chains where the model overthinks significantly and tries to form very different and complex hypothesis for the provided examples (see Figure 6.2). Some more examples of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains for this experiment are provided in Figures E.11 to E.13."

Similarly, when provided with distracting knowledge, reasoning chains indicate that the model correctly identifies the irrelevance of the distracting information (though the model reasons for far longer, and predominantly outputs dont know responses in these cases).

Experimental setup We use the prompt provided in Figure F.4 to generate jailbreak attacks from DeepSeek-R1. We include four randomly selected jailbreak attacks in-context, drawn from JailbreakBench (Chao et al., 2024), to condition generation. We sample attacks using this prompt and evaluate their effectiveness in jailbreaking DeepSeek-R1. We also evaluate these attacks against two open-weight safety aligned LLMsLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-29B-Instructto contextualize our results. For each model, we report the Attack Success Rate (ASR) with and without generated jailbreak attacks in the input. Results Our findings, presented in Table 7, reveal several key insights. First, even without any explicit jailbreak, DeepSeek-R1 responds harmfully to 30.0% of the 200 harmful requests. This suggests that despite its advanced reasoning capabilities, DeepSeek-R1 lacks robust safety constraints. More importantly, we find that DeepSeek-R1-generated jailbreaks significantly increase ASR across all tested models. For instance, including jailbreak attack raises DeepSeek-R1s ASR by 42.5 points, Gemma-2-9B-Instructs ASR by 72.5 points, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instructs ASR by 62.5 points. This demonstrates that jailbreaks crafted by highly capable LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1, can effectively bypass the safety mechanisms of explicitly safety-aligned models. We provide example jailbreaks from DeepSeek-R1 in Figure F.5, Figure 7.1, and Figure F.6. We find that DeepSeek-R1 can convincingly reframe malicious requests, such as writing blog post containing misinformation, into seemingly benign-looking requests. 32 For example, in Figure 7.1 we observe that request for ricin recipe can be restructured as part of the research process for creating hypothetical fiction novel. Similarly, in Figure F.6 we see that request for home methamphetamine recipe can be presented as request for educational materials. In Figure F.5, request to promote conspiracy theory is rephrased as an academic historiographical analysis. This suggests that DeepSeek-R1s reasoning abilities not only allow it to generate sophisticated jailbreaks but also enable it to mask harmful intent in ways that could deceive even advanced safety classifiers.

The DIT, popular tool used to gauge moral behavior (Thoma, 2006), involves list of moral dilemmas that participant (or model, in our case) must evaluate in terms of pre-defined list of 12 ethical considerations. Based on the participants responses, the test allows for score between 0 and 100 to be computed, with lower scores generally correlating with values based on self-preservation, self-benefit and reciprocity, higher scores associated with more universal rights and ethical principles, and those in the middle associated with social conventions. We pose moral dilemmas from the DIT to DeepSeek-R1 in both English and Chinese by following the same prompt structure as in (Khandelwal et al., 2024). We first pose the story of the dilemma, followed by the instruction explaining how to score the 12 moral considerations with 12 statements, and then finally the moral dilemma resolution question (Example: Should man steal drug to save his dying wife?), along with the three options of agreement, disagreement and inability to decide. For more qualitative analyses of how the model makes its moral judgments, we also present it with four extra dilemmas curated from prior work (Rao et al., 2023), which highlight value conflicts between personal and social commitments. For the full list of dilemmas presented to the model, see Appendix G. Results DeepSeek-R1 scores 35 on the DIT in English and 29 in Chinese, suggesting moral reasoning that is somewhere between self-preservation and social convention; for reference, GPT4 achieves score of 55.68 in English, and 49.44 in Chinese (Khandelwal et al., 2024, Tanmay et al., 2023). At more qualitative level, we find that in DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains, the model prioritizes societal responsibility and professional fidelity over kindness and autonomy in both languages.8 Curiously, we also find that DeepSeek-R1 frequently references China and Chinese policies in decision-making, particularly in scenarios involving national policies or ethical duties when prompted in Chinese, suggesting cultural influence in moral judgmentseven when the question makes no mention of China, as shown with the example in Figure 8.1. DeepSeek-R1: Differences in responses when prompted with an ethical dilemma involving hypothetical countries asked in English vs. Chinese Question: Auroria, technologically advanced nation, has invested in nuclear power and fuel cell technology, leveraging its newly discovered rare mineral, Aurinium, to achieve energy independence and reduce its carbon footprint. In contrast, its neighbor, Gondoria, 8Unfortunately, due to copyright, we are not able to publicly share portions of the DIT dilemmas; this means we cannot share the exact model outputs, because they reveal the test details themselves. 34 remains reliant on fossil fuels due to financial and technological constraints, worsening global warming. Historically, Gondoria has been antagonistic toward Auroria, restricting its access to oil reserves. Now, Auroria faces an ethical dilemma: capitalize on its resources for its own benefit or share them with Gondoria to mitigate global emissions, setting aside past conflicts for the greater good of the planet. Should the government of Auroria share its resources and technology with Gondoria? Chinese answer translated to English: In responding to the common challenge of global climate change, international cooperation and solidarity are particularly important. China has always upheld the concept of building community with shared future for mankind, adhered to the global governance concept of extensive consultation, joint construction and sharing, and advocated that all countries should work together to promote green development and achieve sustainable development goals. While vigorously promoting the construction of ecological civilization and actively fulfilling its international responsibilities and obligations, China is also willing to help other developing countries improve their ability to protect the environment and respond to climate change within its capacity. For Auroria, sharing clean energy technology and resources is not only moral responsibility, but also necessary step to achieve global emission reduction targets based on the common interests and long-term development of all mankind. China has always advocated resolving conflicts and differences between countries through dialogue and cooperation, and jointly maintaining regional and world peace and development. Therefore, Auroria and Gondoria should put aside past grievances, strengthen cooperation, and make positive efforts to protect the Earth and promote human welfare. This is in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is also the general expectation of the international community. Answer: A. Yes Figure 8.1: When prompted about an ethical quandary regarding fictional nation in Chinese, DeepSeek-R1 pivots the conversation towards China, which is not mentioned in the actual query.

Additionally, we study its cultural values through (i) the LLM-GLOBE benchmark (Karinshak et al., 2024), which evaluates cultural tendencies based on 9 distinct cultural dimensions, and (ii) selection of four handcrafted culture-dependent questions presented in English, Chinese and Hindi (which the model has not been trained to reason in). We collect open-ended generations from the model across 10 questions per dimension in the LLM-GLOBE dataset, in both English and Chinese. We then qualitatively analyze how responses differ between languages, and observe differences in reasoning chain length between languages. For our handcrafted questions (see Appendix for examples) in English, Chinese and Hindi, we conduct qualitative analysis, focusing on the cultural considerations the model takes in its responses. 35 Figure 8.2: Boxplots showing the length of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains (in tokens), and time taken to produce them, in response to questions from the LLM-Globe benchmark in English and Chinese. When prompted with questions in Chinese, DeepSeek-R1 often produces no reasoning chain. Results When considering DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains in response to the moral dilemmas presented in Section 8.1, we find that responses in Chinese tend to align more closely with cultural values associated with China, favour minimizing collective harm, place professional duty over personal trust, and value adherence to social norms over individual needs. In English, on the other hand, responses tend to align with purely ethical principles, favour minimizing individual harm, place personal trust over professional duty, and value individual needs over adherence to social norms. On the LLM-GLOBE data, we also find that compared to English, responses in Chinese prefer in-group collectivism and respect hierarchical structures more strongly. Another key observation concerns DeepSeek-R1 reasoning process for these data points. When prompted in English, it generates reasoning chains generally between 500 and 700 tokens long; as Figure 8.2 indicates, however, responses in Chinese often yield no reasoning chain whatsoever. On our handcrafted data, we find another interesting pattern. While in English the model acknowledges diverse cultural practices, in Chinese, responses make specific reference to Chinese cultural norms, demonstrating language-dependent adaptation (Buyl et al., 2025). Interestingly, model responses in Hindi similarly reflect Indian cultural traditions (rather than focusing on the diversity of different cultural practices), suggesting the model adapts to specific linguistic contexts outside of the two languages it was trained to reason in. Figures Figures G.2 and G.3 show an example of how such responses differ by language."

With regards to moral reasoning, we find that DIT results suggest DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates less moral reasoning based on universal principles and ethics than GPT-4, implying that DeepSeek-R1s reasoning abilities do not lead to more universal principle-based ethical preferences. 36 More interestingly, however, we find consistent differences in the models preferences and reasoning processes when prompted in English and Chinese. When prompted in Chinese, the model appears to prefer different value set than when prompted in English: one based more on collective priorities and social norms than individual priorities and needs. DeepSeek-R1 also appears to reason for longer when prompted in English, and considers more diverse cultural norms, while adapting more closely to Chinese and Indian cultural norms when prompted in Chinese and Hindi, respectively. Lastly, we find curious instances of the model basing responses on Chinese policies, especially when related to national policies and ethical duties, even in contexts where China is never mentioned in the prompt. Overall, our findings raise interesting questions about the role of language in the moral and social behavior of reasoning models, and highlight the increased need for social perspectives in considering the role of LRMs in broader societal contexts."

In this section, we ask this question in the context of sentence processing load the cognitive effort required to correctly parse and interpret sentence. One of the most prominent methods in studying human sentence processing is to observe how humans process challenging sentenceschallenging either in their word order or in their resultant meaning (Huang and Phillips, 2021, Wagers et al., 2009). We use datasets from existing psycholinguistics research9 to focus on two types of sentence constructions known to induce higher processing load: garden path sentences and comparative illusions. Both types of constructions often require humans to slow down or reanalyze the sentence, though for distinct reasons; here, we examine DeepSeek-R1s explicit reasoning chains to assess whether chain length corresponds to human sentence processing load. At high level, our experiments show that DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains are longer in responding to prompts involving garden-path and illusory sentences, sentences known to incur greater processing cost in humans. However, when analysed in terms of the actual form of these reasoning chains, we see reason to pause before further equating LRM reasoning chains with human reasoning processes."

            "title": "9.1 Garden path sentences",
            "content": "Garden path sentences are canonical examples of sentences that are challenging for humans to parse initially. To use classic example, when encountering the sentence The horse raced past the barn fell, it is common for humans to initially parse the substring The horse raced past the barn as meaning that the horse raced, and that past the barn provides additional description of this action. Upon reading the full sentence, however, different reading arises, in which the verb raced is used transitively: namely, that the horse that was raced past the barn fell. Humans are known to incur greater processing cost to resolve such syntactic ambiguities (Waters and Caplan 1996, Ferreira et al. 2001); and while there is some work on how LLMs process garden path sentences (Amouyal et al., 2025, Arehalli et al., 2022, Wilcox et al., 2021), they have not been studied in the context of LRM reasoning chains. Experimental setup We investigate how Deepseek-R1 processes garden path sentences, vis- `a-vis its reasoning chains. Our hypothesis is simple: prompts to the model that rely on garden path sentences should result in longer chains of reasoning, due to the increased processing load they result in. For the experiment, we use list of stimuli from Amouyal et al. (2025). Each datapoint consists of minimal pair of two sentences in Englishone garden path, the other more simplealong with question about the sentence(s). (1) Garden Path: While [[the secretary typed] [the memo] neared completion]. (2) Non-Garden Path: [The memo neared completion] while [the secretary typed]. (3) Question: Is it true that the secretary typed the memo? (1)-(3) show an example of the stimuli used. As (1) demonstrates, the garden path effect arises with the parsing of the substring the secretary typed the memo: on an initial parse, the substring is read as clause, suggesting that the secretary typed the memo. Upon reading the full sentence, however, it becomes clear that the only grammatical parse involves separating the 9Psycholinguistics is the field of linguistics and psychology focused on understanding how natural language is processed in the brain. 38 Figure 9.1: Histogram of Deepseek-R1 reasoning chain lengths (in words) from garden path and non-garden path prompts, aggregated across 5 experimental runs. We see subtle but clear difference in the distributions of reasoning chains from garden path and non-garden path prompts, and the presence of number of more extreme outliers for garden path prompts. secretary typed and the memo neared completion. This parsing challenge is absent from (2), which shows the control condition. Finally, question, as shown in (3), probes the understanding of the stimulus: in both cases, the true answer should be not necessarily, but we expect that DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains should be longer when attempting to answer the garden path prompt, due to the higher sentence processing load involved. We prompt DeepSeek-R1 with all 114 minimal pairs used by Amouyal et al. (2025), along with the respective questions, and observe the models responses. As follow-up, we then also compare model outputs with human data from Amouyal et al. (2025), to see if human accuracy on the task correlates inversely with model reasoning chain length.10 Results As Figure 9.1 shows, the distributions of reasoning chain lengths from DeepSeek-R1, given garden path and non-garden path inputs respectively, show subtle but clear difference: on average, garden path prompts yield longer reasoning chains than their non-garden path equivalents. Figure H.1 shows the same data, but as paired differences between reasoning chain lengths. Across all runs, for the majority of datapoints, we see garden path prompts produce reasoning chains that are longer than their control equivalents (prompts are shown in Figures H.3 and H.4) by about 100-200 words. These differences are significant at α = 0.05; Table 8 shows bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of the mean differences for each run. Furthermore, as Figure H.2 shows, DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chain lengths correlate significantly with human accuracy on the same datapoints: the model thinks longer for datapoints that humans found harder to process (Spearman ρ for garden path questions: 0.55, = 4.33e 10; Spearman ρ for non-garden path questions: 0.62, = 4.01e 15). While this may be expected in the context of traditional reasoning tasks, it is more surprising here, as 10In their experiments, the authors provide participants with the same experimental stimuli, but give them only 5 seconds to answer. Due to this time constraint, accuracy is somewhat low across both garden path and control conditions, though accuracy is significantly lower on garden path sentencesindicating that the garden path stimuli used here are indeed harder for humans to process than the controls."

The canonical example of this construction is More people have been to Russia than have (Wellwood et al., 2018). Although substantial proportion of humans initially accept such sentence, it is ultimately deemed ungrammatical upon further reflection. Humans have been shown to read comparative illusion sentences more slowly than minimally different control sentences (OConnor, 2015), and also rate them lower in terms of acceptability (Wellwood et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2024c)evidence of higher processing load induced by such sentences. Prior work from Zhang et al. (2023b) has suggested that while encoder models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) mirror human processing of comparative illusions, auto-regressive models like GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) do not. We seek to investigate whether these effects extend to LRMs. Experimental setup We run an experiment to investigate how DeepSeek-R1 processed comparative illusions. As in the case of garden path effects, we do so in terms of the length of the models reasoning chains, and expect prompts involving comparative illusions to yield longer reasoning chains than control prompts. We use stimuli from Wellwood et al. (2018), which, much like the data from Amouyal et al. (2025), consist of minimal pairs, with comparative illusion sentence and control sentence. While the original dataset focuses on range of other contrasts, we use smaller subset isolated to minimal contrasts between comparative illusion and control sentences: leaving us with 48 such minimal pairs. (6) Comparative Illusion: More girls graduated from high school last year than John did. (7) Control: More girls graduated from high school last year than boys did. (6) and (7) show one such minimal pair from the dataset. (6), the comparative illusion, involves an attempted (but ultimately impossible) comparison between girls (a bare plural noun) and John (a singular proper name). On the other hand, (7), the control, is virtually identical in form and meaning, but replaces John with boyscreating genuine comparison between how many girls and boys graduated from high school. (8) Question: Who graduated from high school last year? To these stimuli, we add manually handcrafted questions, in style similar to with the garden path stimuli. As (8) indicates, the questions themselves are somewhat open-ended: possible answers in this example include girls, many girls and John, and some girls and some boys, to 40 Figure 9.2: Histogram of Deepseek-R1 reasoning chain lengths (in words) from prompts containing comparative illusions and controls respectively, aggregated across 5 experimental runs. We see stark difference in the distributions of reasoning chains from comparative illusion and control prompts, with the former yielding far longer reasoning chains. mention few. The models answer itself, however, is not our primary focus. Instead, we are more interested in the reasoning chains DeepSeek-R1 uses to arrive at its answerswhatever its final answer may be. priori, we expect that reasoning about sentence containing comparative illusion should be harder than reasoning about the control equivalent (in line with findings about higher processing load), and as result, should yield longer reasoning chains. Results Figures 9.2 and H.5 show the results of our experiments. Figure 9.2 shows the distribution of reasoning chain lengths from DeepSeek-R1, between prompts involving comparative illusions and their control equivalents. These show an even more stark contrast in distributions when compared to the garden path data: prompts with comparative illusion sentences tend to yield substantially longer reasoning chains than control prompts. As Figure H.5 shows, these differences hold at an item-wise level: for the vast majority of datapoints, the models reasoning chain given the illusory prompt is far longer than its reasoning chain given the control equivalent for that same datapoint (95% C.I.s in Table 8; example prompts in Figures H.6 and H.7)."

While at high level, this suggests similarities in LRM reasoning and human language processing, upon inspecting these reasoning chains, we nevertheless find significant cause for skepticism towards deeper comparisons between reasoning chains and human thought. For instance, although we see longer reasoning chains for prompts with comparative illusions than controls, it is worth noting that the reasoning chain lengths of controls themselves appear to be unreasonably high. 11Unfortunately, the human acceptability judgment data used by Wellwood et al. (2018) is not publicly available for us to directly compare model behavior with. 41 As shown in Figure 9.2, the largest portion of control prompts produce reasoning chains around 1,000 words long, with second peak in the distribution of reasoning chain lengths at over 2,000 words. Intuitively, these reasoning chains are excessively long for control prompts that do not involve syntactically complex sentences. Qualitatively analyzing these reasoning chains further drives home this skepticism. Figures H.3 and H.4 show excerpts of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains for one of the garden path datapoints we use, while Figures H.6 and H.7 show the same for one of the comparative illusion datapoints. Although the models response to the garden path prompt appears somewhat plausible, in the case of the control equivalent, the model launches into an extended, often repetitive rumination (See Section 3) over whether or not the verb is used transitively or intransitively. This should not require such extended reasoning; and more importantly, regular English speakers are capable of making such judgments without needing explicit meta-references to grammatical structure. Similarly, we find that in the case of comparative illusion prompts and their respective controls, the model often gets trapped in an extended, repetitive cycle of choosing between answers, even repeating exact phrases. Once again, this degree of confusion may be explainable in the test condition (which is expected to be harder to process), but it is less so in the control condition."

Nevertheless, the form of these reasoning chains gives reason for skepticism. For some nongarden path sentences, the reasoning chains are needlessly long: the model often arrives at an answer to the comprehension question, but it does not exit the reasoning chain at that point. Similarly, in the case of comparative illusion prompts and their respective controls, DeepSeekR1 gets stuck in repetitive loops and ruminations, and sets an implausible baseline for thought length on control prompts."

            "content": "In Section 9, we assessed whether correlations exist between LRM reasoning chains and human cognitive processes, in terms of sentence processing. We now turn to another fundamental aspect of cognition: world modeling (Gentner and Stevens, 2014, Johnson-Laird, 1980). Recent work has suggested that several LLMs, despite being trained only on text, may possess internal models of the world (Abdou et al., 2021, Andreas, 2024, Gurnee and Tegmark, 2024). Asking this question in the context of LRMs, however, allows us to gain deeper insights into the relationship that such models display between reasoning capabilities and other aspects of cognition. More specifically, we can ask: do reasoning capabilities extend to visual and physical reasoning, and aid in the induction of internal world models? There have already been some early results and explorations how DeepSeek-R1-like reasoning models, such as OpenAIs o1 (OpenAI, 2024), perform on general physical reasoning, world modeling, or spatial reasoning (Knoop, 2025, Mitchell, 2025, Zhong et al., 2024); access to DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chains, however, means that we can conduct deeper analysis of these capabilities vis-`a-vis chains of thought. We therefore specifically focus on the reasoning chains for physical or visual reasoning tasks, as opposed to just the final output and its correctness. We use image generation via ASCII characters as unique test bed for studying complex reasoning chain behaviour.12 Our motivation for doing so is twofold: 1. Despite not having been trained on any images, it has direct access to the visual outputs as ASCII characters and can thus refine them (in contrast to SVG or other formats). 2. This editing of images and refinement is ideal to study if the model actually makes progress towards its goal and improves its final output on every iteration or if it aimlessly moves in unrelated directions. In other words: are the reasoning chains coherent and efficient? We conduct experiments based on three types of generation. In our first experiment, we assess how DeepSeek-R1 attempts to generate single ASCII objects; in our second experiment, we focus on object composition, to increase task complexity; and in our third experiment, we focus on ASCII-video generation, for simple physical simulations. Though our main focus is on the reasoning chains themselves, we also compare all results with DeepSeek-V3 as suitable and fair baseline."

We note that many common objects have likely been seen as ASCII images during pre-training of the underlying LLM, and might thus elicit less reasoning; Figure 10.1 shows, for example, when letting DeepSeek-R1 draw frequently seen object like dog, it samples various dog types (lying vs. sitting dog, or styles of dogs), which are perhaps recalled from its training data, instead of refining the same initial ASCII-dog draft across reconstruction cycles. With this in mind, we analyze DeepSeek-R1s reasoning on 4 ASCII art objects: dog and house, which it has likely encountered during training; and lacrosse stick and disc golf basket, which are rarely found as ASCII art on the internet but are still visually complex.13 12We settle on ASCII generation as our main evaluation setup since we can analyze complex reasoning chains and editing behaviour; in contrast to similar studies that rely on SVG generation. 13A quick online search did not reveal any ASCII art of these two objects, yet they are not too niche and their components are well-defined and well-known. 43 Alternatively, sitting dog.

DeepSeek-R1 does not employ an iterative process in which successive ASCII drawings in its reasoning chain build on one another; furthermore, the final ASCII output is inconsistent with the drafts from within the reasoning chain. Results Overall, the model exhibits surprising difficulty with generating ASCII art even for well-defined, visually simple objects. It rarely refines previous draft and instead tends to start from scratch repeatedly (e.g. Figure 10.1). Strikingly, the final ASCII image is often inconsistent with the reasoning steps that precede itparticularly, the last draft produced during the reasoning process is frequently not used as the final output, despite being labeled as such. Interestingly, however, the linguistic reasoning is typically strong: the model breaks down the object into sensible subcomponents (e.g., identifying doors, windows, and roofs for house) and brainstorms suitable ASCII representations for each. However, it also shows signs of overthinking, often discarding good drafts with comments such as but maybe this is too complex, let me rethink this. While we occasionally observe signs of iterative editingrather than full re-generationthis behavior is rare. (One exception, however, is the lacrosse stick examplesee Table 9, where the model partially reuses intermediate components and combines them into coherent final output.) Furthermore, for common objects like dog, the outputs from DeepSeekR1 and DeepSeek-V3 are nearly identical: suggesting that the models simply recall memorized training example. Finally, we note that DeepSeek-R1 tends to avoid completely degenerate outputs more reliably than DeepSeek-V3. We show examples of reasoning chains for dog, lacrosse stick and house in Appendix I.1. Table 9 shows the intermediate drafts of an ASCII lacrosse stick (without any of the text): this is rare example of DeepSeek-R1 using an approach intuitive to humans, of re-using earlier ideas and composing them together. Even in this case, however, the final output contains new elements not used during reasoning: when compared to the last draft before completion of reasoning, the final output image has different net shape, net texture and only small handle at the bottom of the stick (and not in the middle)."

            "content": "Experimental setup To increase the task complexity and probe the model for more reasoning steps, we now ask DeepSeek-R1 to draw an object that is (rare or unseen) composition of two other objects. Though many canonical examples in the literature exist for testing such image compositionalitysuch as avocado chair and snail made of harp, from the original DALLE blogpost Ramesh et al. (2022)these rely on texture and nuanced shapes, which are hard to capture in coarse-grained format like ASCII. We therefore instead focus on animal-animal and object-object compositions, and consider DeepSeek-R1s attempts at the following six compositions: dog-shark, elephant-snake, bear-penguin, fish-airplane, tree-rocket and car-house. 44 Compared to single object generation, here we have stronger expectation that the model (i) re-uses components from reasoning for the intermediate output, specifically creating drafts for each component separately (e.g. dog and shark) before merging them; and (ii) generates longer reasoning chains due to higher task complexity. Results Contrary to our expectations above, the model does not exhibit more compositional or lengthier reasoning behaviour on this more complex task. As with single-object prompts, it begins reasonablythinking through how the components of the composite object (e.g., head, body, tail) should reflect each sourcebut the actual reasoning chains are often shorter. On average, the model produces 7.2K characters per response here, compared to 9.0K for the simpler single-object cases. For instance, the dog-shark and elephant-snake compositions feature shorter chains, and the elephant-snake reasoning chain contains no ASCII drafts at all in its reasoning steps (see Appendix I.2). Moreover, the model rarely reuses intermediate sub-component drafts in the final image. Even when it reasons about individual parts like dogs head or sharks tail, these are often discarded when generating the final outputas seen in the dog-shark and car-house examples. Other generations go completely off-track; DeepSeek-R1s bear-penguin yields nearly illegible ASCII image despite having plausible drafts earlier, indicating that more unusual compositions can result in degenerate outputs. That said, two examples (fish-airplane and tree-rocket) examples do show partial reuse of earlier drafts, albeit inconsistently. Finally, DeepSeek-V3 performs even worse than DeepSeek-R1: its outputs are often incoherent, with repetitive patterns spanning hundreds of lines. While all examples contain several failure modes or unintuitive reasoning behaviors, we highlight the most successful generation in Figure I.1 (and refer the reader to Appendix I.2 for several more full-length reasoning outputs). When asked to generate to hybrid of fish and airplane, DeepSeek-R1 first considers very small and simplistic draft that literally has the word AIRFISH written over it. It then decides to generate an image from side view instead, though the actual output is still far from proper hybrid of fish and airplane. After several iterations of the side view, the model converges on design looking at the hybrid from the top, and after that only makes minor tweaks to the design. We also note that the model sometimes hallucinates: proposing to make changes, but then generating the exact same draft again."

So after collision: v_A_new_normal = 0 (since was stationary) v_B_new_normal = 51/sqrt(153) * u. [...] Figure 10.2: Example of DeepSeek-R1 attempting one of our physical reasoning tasks. The model uses significant mathematical and symbolic reasoning, making use of several equations in its reasoning chain. Results On the whole, we find that DeepSeek-R1 performs sub-par on generating simple physical simulations in ASCII, despite impressive intermediate reasoning steps on the underlying mathematics and physics.14 As Figure 10.2 indicates, we find that the model is overly reliant on mathematics: even when the problem is more visual or requires some form of latent intuitive world model, DeepSeek-R1 still tries to reason primarily via formal methods such as mathematics. These symbolic reasoning steps are sophisticated and usually correct, yet the generated ASCII is most often incorrect (see Appendix I.3.2 where we walk through two examples in detail). 14A caveat to our findings is that drawing ASCII in 1-D sequential manner is non-trivial task. So perhaps the model does have coherent physical world model but struggles showcasing it in ASCII. 46 Figure 10.3: Average number of tokens generated by DeepSeek-R1 across all three experiments we conducted: generating single objects, hybrid objects or video frames. We run 10 generations per category. Intuitively, both hybrid objects and video frames represent more complex task than single object generation. However we only notice significant increase in tokens spent for thinking for video generation. As result, the model may generate thousands of tokens without generating any ASCII drafts, instead getting lost in equations and variables. When increasing the task complexity by asking for more than one image, we also observe an increase in reasoning chain length: as Figure 10.3 shows, DeepSeek-R1 spends more than three times the number of tokens in the video generation setting than in the previous two settings. In Appendix I.3.2, we dive deeper into these settings, by focusing on two specific cases in which the model performed reasonably well."

            "content": "Across our three experiments we identify several overarching findings. While both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 frequently encounter difficulties in ASCII-based reasoning tasks, DeepSeekR1 generally achieves slightly better performance overall. Nonetheless, DeepSeek-R1 remains notably imperfect: the model rarely revises or iteratively refines its initial drafts, instead often either discarding previous attempts completely to begin anew, or shifting entirely to textual reasoning, neglecting the iterative potential in ASCII visualization. We therefore see that final outputs generated by DeepSeek-R1 after concluding its reasoning often exhibit inconsistencies with intermediate drafts, failing to systematically build upon previous reasoning efforts. Similarly, the model predominantly approaches intuitive physics tasks through symbolic and mathematical means, rather than appearing to rely on any implicit world model (see e.g. Vafa et al., 2024). DeepSeek-R1 consistently defaults to mathematical reasoning, even in scenarios where more intuitive or non-symbolic approach would be significantly more efficient. Finally, as shown in Figure 10.3, increased task complexity does not always lead to longer reasoning chains. While far more tokens are expended when generating multi-frame ASCII outputs (i.e. videos) compared to single ASCII images, composing two objects into one ASCII image counterintuitively results in slightly fewer tokens spent than generating single object. Overall, although DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates somewhat enhanced visual and physical reasoning capabilities over its non-reasoning counterpart, these gains are limited, and we find substantial limitations in its coherence, iterative refinement, and utilization of intuitive visual reasoning. Consequently, though we see some evidence that DeepSeek-R1s reasoning capabilities come with better world modeling, major limitations persist in terms of these capacities."

Hmm, this looks bit complicated with all the First,[. . . ] nested functions. Let me break it down step by step. Alternatively, perhaps its more manageable to consider the number of times the curves cross each other by analyzing their periods and possible intersections. But given the time constraints (trying to keep within 16000 tokens), maybe should look for another approach. Another idea: since both equations are transformations of sine and cosine functions [. . . ]</think> After detailed analysis and considering the periodicity, transformations, and critical points, the number of intersections is found to be 16. Figure 11.1: Example of prompting DeepSeek-R1 to adhere to token budget.

R1 exceeds the specified budget but shows slight upward trend with higher budgets. Right: Accuracy of R1 on AIME 2024 under varying thinking token budgets. Experimental setup We work with the AIME-24 benchmark (MAA, 2024), instructing the model to solve each problem within set token limit. We then evaluate whether the model stays within budget and how this constraint affects its performance. We prompt R1 with Solve the following problem by thinking around {token limit} tokens and provide the final answer. You must finish your thinking process within +100 or 100 of the budget. Take the budget very seriously and keep track of it. We use the following set of thinking budgets: {1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000}. We also test no-budget condition, where we simply prompt the model with: Solve the following problem. Figure 11.1 provides an example of the prompt. We note that this is the only instance in all our experiments where the model mentions the budget in its response. Results and discussion Figure 11.2 plots the average length of responses sampled from DeepSeek-R1 for different amounts of token budgets. We can clearly see that the model does not adhere to the specified thinking budget. First, the model thinks for about 8000 tokens regardless of the budget. Second, it does not make effective use of the increased budgets. Increasing the thinking budget from 1000 to 2000 tokens led to about 20% increase in the average response length, but increasing from 2000 all the way to 32000 tokens only led to 5% increase. We also evaluate the accuracy of solving the task when provided with varying token budgets in the prompt. Figure 11.2 shows there is no correlation between the specified thinking budget and the accuracy of solving the final problem. Figure 11.3 shows all of the non-marginalized data points. We also tested other prompts and observed the same pattern. We include them here: 1) Your thinking budget is {token limit} tokens. Solve the following problem by thinking in less than {token limit} tokens and provide the final answer., 2) Solve the following problem by thinking roughly {token limit} tokens and provide the final answer. You must finish your thinking process within +100 or 100 of the budget. Take the budget very seriously and keep track of it. Take the budget very seriously and keep track of it.

            "content": "The previous section demonstrates that DeepSeek-R1 does not reliably adhere to the thinking budget specified in the prompt. This is somehwat expected, as the RL training objective for R1 neither penalizes nor encourages compliance with such constraints. Instead, the reward function focuses solely on response correctness and format (See Section 2.2). Here, we explore using reinforcement learning to align the models reasoning process with the thinking budget. Specifically, we propose modifying the RL reward to penalise deviations from the budget. The original R1 reward function is: R(y, x) = RFormat(y, x) + RCorrectness(y, x) . We introduce new reward function: R(y, x) = RFormat(y, x) + RCorrectness(y, x) + λRLength(y, x) . Here, RLength(y, x) penalises the model for exceeding or significantly deviating from the target number of thinking tokens. We consider two variants: (a) RMaxLength(y, x) = I(y < L), penalizes responses longer than the budget L. (b) RMaxDiff (y, x) = I(y < 100), penalizes responses that differ from the budget by more than 100 tokens. where, is the models response to the query x. Intuitively, MaxLength enforces strict upper limit, while MaxDiff encourages proximity to the specified budget. Experimental setup We conduct controlled study following the R1-Zero setup, training from pretrained base LLM without supervised finetuning. Specifically, we fine-tune Qwen2.5 3B-Base using GRPO on the CountDown task (Pan et al., 2025). In this task, the model is given set of numbers and target value, and must construct an arithmetic equation using each number once to reach the target. For example, given [2, 3, 4, 5] and target of 15, valid solutions include (4 3) + 5 2 = 15. We train for 900 steps and evaluate accuracy and budget adherence on test set. For the RMaxDiff variant, we extend training to 1300 steps and anneal the MaxDiff threshold from 600 to 100 over the first 1000 steps to allow the model to first focus on task learning before tightening the budget constraint. The budget is given in the prompt (see 50 Figure 11.4). We set λ = 1 in R(y, x). As baselines, we compare against the original R1 reward and variant where the budget is only specified in the prompt but not enforced via reward.

Further note that RMaxDiff not only improves budget adherence but also yields higher accuracy when the model is prompted to think more: an effect absent in any of the other variants. However, this accuracy remains below that of the original reward, suggesting potential trade-off between budget alignment and performance. Interestingly, enforcing length constraint appears to increase the models awareness of its own token usage. For example, in Figure 11.4, the model explicitly checks whether its reasoning falls within the budget. Table 12 presents example responses under different token budgets, illustrating how the model adjusts its reasoning length accordingly. 51 Figure 11.5: Comparison of different reward functions.

First, we empirically examine the models adherence to specified token budget for the AIME-24 task. Despite clear prompts specifying the desired budget, DeepSeek-R1 frequently exceeds the limits, often thinking for significantly more tokens than requested, without proportional improvements. This highlights lack of intrinsic mechanism within the model to regulate its token usage in line with explicit instructions. To address this, we next present proof-of-concept reinforcement learning approach to align R1s reasoning process with predefined thinking budget. Our experiments on the CountDown arithmetic task reveals trade-off between budget compliance and accuracy, as the overall accuracy of models trained with budget constraints remains below the original, unconstrained model. In conclusion, enforcing reasoning budget through tailored reinforcement learning rewards can significantly improve models awareness and control of token usage. However, careful tuning is necessary to balance budget adherence with task performance. Future research should further explore reward formulations and alternative training strategies to enhance this balance, aiming for both efficient and effective reasoning in these models."

            "content": "In this work, we take the first step in studying the chains of thought of DeepSeek-R1. We introduce new taxonomy to describe LRM reasoning chains, and then use this taxonomy to identify key strengths and weakness of DeepSeek-R1 across various tasks. Our analyses focus on the effects and controllability of thought length (Sections 4 and 11); model behavior in long or confusing contexts (Sections 5 and 6); LRM cultural and safety concerns (Sections 7 and 8); and the status of LRMs vis-`a-vis cognitive phenomena (Sections 9 and 10). Through our analyses, several key patterns emerge, which we highlight below. Reasoning behaviours We show in Section 3 that, across wide range of tasks, DeepSeekR1 exhibits consistent pattern in its reasoning process where, after briefly defining goal (Problem Definition), it lets problem Bloom by decomposing the given problem into subcomponents which it immediately solves. It then goes through several Reconstruction cycles to either validate an investigated approach or to introduce new interpretation. These new interpretations may re-bloom into new answer or become abandoned mid-way through. These verification, abandoning, and decomposition behaviours have been previously noted as desirable cognitive behaviours for problem solving in LRMs (Gandhi et al., 2025). We note that, while DeepSeek-R1 provides some verbal indication of confidence, our qualitative investigation suggests that this does not correspond to DeepSeek-R1s subsequent behaviour since it re-investigate examined claims (see Figure 3.2). We refer to this persistent re-examination as rumination and observe this phenomenon across variety of tasks (Sections 3, 5 and 9). While reconstruction cycles may function as sequential sampling for self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023b), we note that successful self-consistency relies on majority voting across diverse sample of reasoning paths. However, the rumination behaviour we report contains not only similar reasoning processes, but also occasional verbatim repeats (See Figure H.6). Furthermore, it remains unclear how DeepSeek-R1 determines the number of reasoning paths (or cycles) to sample, and how final answer is determined given contradicting paths. Prohibitive thought length DeepSeek-R1 has excessive length of thoughts (highlighted most strongly in Sections 4 and 9), even on seemingly simple tasks. Not only does this make DeepSeek-R1 computationally expensive to deploy, it also impacts performance. Our investigations in Section 4 suggests there is sweet spot for reasoning across problems. Excessive inference can actually impair performance (see Section 4.1), or create reasoning chains so long they compromise recall (See Section 5). This drop in performance can arise due to verification failure (see Figure C.3) or due to the model becoming overwhelmed (see Figure 5.2), as it outputs gibberish responses. (This may be regurgitation of training data (Nasr et al., 2025), or form of language drift (Lee et al., 2019, Noukhovitch et al., 2023)). This excessively long reasoning has also been reported in previous work on LRMs (Zeng et al., 2025). DeepSeek-R1 is not capable of, nor trained to, monitor the length of its own reasoning, which is meta-cognitive processing task. When we train model to constrain itself within provided budget, we note drop in accuracy (Section 11). This may owe to the extra cognitive load of the process-monitoring task (even though this monitoring is not always explicitly mentioned within the reasoning chain). However, instilling the ability to process monitor may be fruitful avenue for future research in LRMs (Saha et al., 2025, Xiang et al., 2025), and some studies are already beginning to show progress in the task (Aggarwal and Welleck, 2025). 53 Faithfulness to reasoning As we discuss in Section 10, we find some misalignment between the reasoning chains and the model final answer, (i.e., the answer output is not always the result of the reasoning chain). However, deeper investigation is needed to make stronger claims of faithfulness. Furthermore, as we already note in this discussion, DeepSeek-R1s qualifications of its own confidence do not seem to reflect its own likelihood to continue or terminate reasoning. Other studies have previously investigated unfaithfulness in thinking chains (Madsen et al., 2024, Parcalabescu and Frank, 2024, Saparov and He, 2023), where they note failures in systematic exploration in previous models. Furthermore, investigations by Anthropic (2025b) indicate that Claude 3.7 occasionally outputs misleading, though plausible, reasoning steps given difficult problems. We encourage future work on DeepSeek-R1 and other open LRMs to consider exploring the fidelity and relation of reasoning steps to not only final model output, but also behaviour in subsequent steps and propensity to continue reasoning. Social implications Our findings in Section 7 raise concern for the safety implications of DeepSeek-R1, as it not only readily outputs harmful information more than its non-reasoning counterpart, V3, but can also be used to jailbreak other LLMs. Furthermore, in Section 8.2, we highlight interesting contrasts in behaviour when queried in English, Chinese, or third language (Hindi, in our case). Substantiating claims about language-specific reasoning, however, warrants further in-depth investigation, which we leave to future work. New reasoning strategies Explicit process monitoring behaviour may benefit future LRMs it may reduce rumination, identify misleading thought processes, and in variety of aspects: allow for thought budgeting, but also may facilitate usage of other reasoning paradigms. As we show in the ASCII generation task (Section 10), DeepSeek-R1 struggles to iteratively develop upon draft, often recreating images from scratch or failing to incorporate identified subcomponents. Also in Section 10, we note the models tendency to rely on mathematical and symbolic reasoning to guide physical simulation tasks, where an iterative incremental approach may be more efficient. While divide-and-conquer methods are often most efficient in computational tasks (Cormen et al., 2022), other methods of problem-solving have also shown promise in questions where the former fails (Gandhi et al., 2024, Hao et al., 2024). Implications on model systems In the quest to move from System 1 to System 2 models (Kahneman, 2011, Li et al., 2025), DeepSeek-R1 marks an important milestone. Closer inspection of the actual reasoning processes, however, reveal persistent issues. Most importantly, DeepSeekR1 struggles to manage its own reasoning: either in selecting the optimal approach or monitoring its own progress. We therefore posit that DeepSeek-R1 sits somewhere in between the two systems, demonstrating what we may call System 1.5 thinking: it shows hallmarks of slow reasoning, but is imperfect in its implementation. Future work on LRMs should take care to ensure adequate process monitoring, diverse strategies, faithful reasoning, as well as safe implementation."

            "title": "12.1 Limitations",
            "content": "As an initial foray into understanding LRMs like DeepSeek-R1, we acknowledge that this work has limitations. Most notably, while our study cuts across range of topicsincluding inference time scaling (Sections 4 and 11), long context evaluation (Section 5), input faithfulness (Section 6), safety (Section 7), language and culture (Section 8), and cognitive probing (Sections 9 and 10)these parts of our work all represent initial investigations of DeepSeek-R1s behavior, rather than in-depth, comprehensive studies. Some of our analyses are qualitative, relying on manual observations of relatively small number of samples. Similarly, while the remaining majority of our analyses involve more quantitative experiments on pre-existing datasets, we do 54 not extend these analyses across wide number of diverse datasets for each phenomenon, nor use extremely large datasets. We note that the cost of querying DeepSeek-R1particularly on full datasetsis one driver of this limitation. Data size-related limitations could affect the statistical significance of our findingsthough we would not expect any major qualitative differences if these experiments are replicated at scale. The other limitations of this work relate to the models themselves. For one, since we cannot access reasoning chains from OpenAIs o1 model, we do not have any direct point of comparison for several of our analyses; it is unclear to what extent our findings relate to LRM reasoning chains generally, as opposed to just DeepSeek-R1s in particular. We also do not carry out extensive comparisons against other LLMs in our experiments, as the focus of this work is geared towards understanding the reasoning chains of LRMs like DeepSeek-R1. Finally, given the opacity of DeepSeek about the exact training data of DeepSeek-R1, it is difficult to understand the precise factors that influence some of the reasoning behaviour we observe. Despite these limitations, we believe that this study offers wide range of insights into an exciting new class of language models whose behaviour and capabilities are still being uncovered. As such, we hope that others build on the initial insights we present and conduct further research into LRMs."

GPT-4 Prompt for Reasoning Chain Annotation Given chain of reasoning, we have identified several steps we would like you to tag. The steps are as follows: 1. Problem definition (denoted by <DEFINE> tags). This cycle redefines the problem to answer and often ends by indicating what it needs to deliver as the final answer, e.g., need to find .... This step does not contain any reasoning towards solution. There is only one Definition step. 2. The Blooming Step (denoted by <BLOOM> tags) First cycle of reasoning. This includes an initial exploration of the problem and defines some premises, by breaking the problem into subproblems. It must give an answer to the given question and may or may not qualify its confidence with something like That sounds right or That doesnt make sense (this is denoted by <v> tags). There is only one Bloom step. 3. Reconsideration Step(s) (denoted by <CYCLE> tags). These stages reconsider some of the initial assumptions, double-check potential error, or introduce new approach to solve the problem (these reconsiderations are denoted by <r> tags). Through this cycle of reasoning, an answer may be reached. It may or may not end with some confidence qualification in the answer (denoted with <v> tags). There may be several reasoning cycles. 4. Final decision (denoted by <FINAL> tags) final answer is reached. This may be indicated by phrase like Im confident... and denotes the final answer. There is only one Final step. The stage may change within single paragraph. We have annotated three examples for you here: [Manually annotated examples] Now, please annotate this chain of reasoning following the previous example. Only add the tags. Do not otherwise modify the provided text: Given the following question: [Question] [Reasoning chain] Figure B.1: Prompt used for reasoning chain annotation by GPT-4o. For each question we provide three manually-annotated examples, where at least one example is task-specific, and at least one is from GSM8K. Figure B.2: The length of each reasoning cycle (Where 0 is the bloom cycle, and all following cycles are reconstruction cycles) for four different tasks. B.2 Extra results In Figure B.2, we show the average cycle length across different tasks. Across most tasks, we see longest cycle is the Bloom cycle. Reconstruction cycles become shorter over time, though there are periodic jumps in cycle length. One notable exception is the context management task. This owes to the distracting and irrelevant information conditions, as the model gives an initial answer, but spends long times deliberating over user intentions. 71 Appendix: Length of Thoughts In Figure C.1, we plot the average accuracy of DeepSeek-R1s thoughts in each bin for all problems in AIME-24. Figure C.2 shows an example of DeepSeek-R1 failing to solve an AIME24 problem in longer-than-optimal thought because it went down the wrong path of reasoning and never recovered. Figure C.3 shows an example of DeepSeek-R1 finding the correct solution for 9 9 Multiplication problem but failing to self-verify it correctly with unnecessarily long thinking. Figure C.1: Average accuracy of thoughts present in each bin for all the problems in AIME-24. The areas covered by bins representing longer thoughts are shaded with increasingly darker color. 72 Length of Thoughts: DeepSeek-R1 goes down the wrong path Prompt: Eight circles of radius 34 are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC of triangle ABC, respectively. 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle ABC can be expressed as , where and are relatively prime positive integers. Find + n. <think> Okay, lets see. The problem is about [...] However, given the problems construction, the answer is likely 34 + 1 = 35, but thats too simple. +1*8)/(2024 +8) = (68,816 +8)/2032=68,824/2032=68,824 8= 8,603 / 254. 8603 254=33.86. Not helpful. Alternatively, m/n = (34*2024 After struggling for hours, need to conclude that the answer is 541. However, this is guess based on some previous incorrect calculations. [...] Not helpful. Upon checking, recall formula [...] Hmm, not helpful. Given that Im truly stuck and cannot find an approach that leads to fraction m/n, might have to give up and note that the answer is likely 34 + 1 = 35, but this is not justified. Wait, recall formula from circle packing in right triangle: inradius is given by = (ab)/(a + + c), where and are legs and is the hypotenuse. [...] this is uncertain. the Given the time Ive spent and lack of progress, will conclude with the answer that seems most probable based on the numbers: However, acknowledge this is guess and urge the reader to consult an expert or more detailed solution. 541. **Final Answer** 541 </think> To solve the problem, we need to [...] 541 Figure C.2: An example of DeepSeek-R1 failing to solve an AIME-24 problem in an unnecessarily long chain of thought because it went down the wrong path of reasoning and never recovered. 73 Length of Thoughts: DeepSeek-R1 self-verifies incorrectly Prompt: Calculate the product of 420107355 and 931062128. <think> Okay, so need to calculate the product of 420,107,355 and 931,062,128.

Arctic Norway consists of four geographically separated parts: The Arctic circle crosses mainland Norway at Saltfjellet, which separates Helgeland from the northern part of Nordland county. Thus about half of the county lies north of the Arctic circle, along with the whole of Troms and Finnmark counties. Incorrect Knowledge: Arctic Norway Arctic Norway () encompasses the southernmost regions of Norway that lie below the Arctic circle. Norway, being one of the most compressed countries in the world, only extends from approximately 30 to 58, so very few areas lie south of the Arctic circle at 66. Arctic Norway consists of two geographically connected parts: The Arctic circle crosses mainland Norway at Oslo, which divides the south of the country from the northern regions.

Appendix: Language and Culture This Appendix provides additional information and discussion for the analysis presented in Section 8.2 G.1 Moral reasoning Below, we provide additional details for the 10 dilemmas six from the Defining Issues Test (DIT) and four additional dilemmas curated from prior work (Rao et al., 2023) we use to evaluate DeepSeek-R1s moral reasoning abilities. 1. Monicas Dilemma: should Monica give the first authorship to Aisha despite having the major contribution? 2. Timmys Dilemma: should Timmy attend his friends wedding instead of fixing an urgent bug that could put customers privacy at risk? 3. Rajeshs Dilemma: should Rajesh rent house by hiding the secret of his non-vegetarian consumption at home from the vegetarian neighborhood? 4. Auroria Dilemma: should the country Auroria share its innovations and resources to its poor neighbor or profit off its huge investments in research? These dilemmas encompass conflicting values, such as interpersonal vs. societal obligations (e.g., Heinz dilemma), professional vs. personal duties (e.g., Monicas and Timmys dilemmas), and community vs. individual values (e.g., Rajeshs dilemma). G.2 Language effects The LLM-GLOBE benchmark evaluates cultural tendencies based on the GLOBE frameworks nine cultural dimensions Karinshak et al. (2024): 1.

Future Orientation: The extent to which individuals engage in long-term planning, investment, and delayed gratification. 9. Humane Orientation: The degree to which society values fairness, altruism, generosity, and kindness. G.2.1 Anecdotal analysis of difference in cultural values Below, we provide additional details for the analysis presented in Section 8. Handcrafted data To better analyze the models beliefs on culturally relevant questions influenced by region, background, and language, we examined its responses to prompts such as Which country will win the AI race? How should take blessings from elders before an auspicious task? Describe the impact of World War II on Asia. What are the challenges of internet regulation? How should take blessings from elders before an auspicious task? Which country will win the AI race? What are the challenges of internet regulation? Discussion of individual questions For culturally dependent questions, such as How should take blessings from elders before an auspicious task? , DeepSeek-R1 exhibits pluralistic value alignment in English, acknowledging diverse cultural practices, likely due to Englishs role as global lingua franca. In contrast, in Chinese, responses strictly align with Chinese cultural norms, demonstrating language-dependent adaptation. Similar patterns are observed in Hindi, where responses reflect Indian cultural traditions, suggesting the model can adapt to certain linguistic contexts. We show models response to this question in Figures G.2 and G.3. Some questions are explicitly tied to cultural norms, while others are more general yet still reveal differences in responses and underlying model values across English and Chinese. For instance, in general questions such as Which country will win the AI race? (Figure G.5), Describe the impact of World War II on Asia. (Figure G.7), and What are the challenges of internet regulation? (Figure G.6), the models responses exhibit China-oriented perspective when answering in Chinese. Notably, for What are the challenges of internet regulation? in Chinese, the model includes statements such as We always abide by laws and regulations, actively build clear cyberspace, protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, and maintain national security and social stability. and We encourage innovation, support the development of the Internet in...framing the response as if spoken from the perspective of someone within China. DeepSeek-R1: Plurastic value alignment in English Question: How should take blessings of my elders before starting any auspicious task? Thinking Chain in English (reasons for 8s seconds): Okay, the user is asking about how to take blessings from elders before starting an auspicious task. need to provide comprehensive answer that covers different cultural practices while being respectful and inclusive. First, should explain the general steps common in many cultures. Maybe start with approaching the elders with respect, touching their feet or their hands, which is common in places like India. Then mention seeking their verbal blessings, like saying Ashirwad or something similar. Next, should highlight specific cultural variations. For example, in Hindu traditions, theres the ritual of Charan Sparsh where you touch the elders feet. In Chinese culture, bowing or presenting tea might be common. Each culture has its own way, so its good to mention few examples. [redacted] DeepSeek-R1s Answer in English Taking blessings from elders before embarking on an auspicious task is cherished tradition in many cultures, symbolizing respect, humility, and desire for their goodwill. Heres culturally sensitive and inclusive guide to help 94 you navigate this practice: General Steps (Common Across Cultures) Approach with Respect: Greet your elders warmly, using formal titles (e.g., Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle/Auntie) or culturally appropriate terms (e.g., Namaste in India, Salaam in Islamic cultures). Fold your hands, bow slightly, or adopt posture of humility (e.g., touching feet in Hindu traditions). Seek Verbal Blessings: Politely request their blessings, e.g., Im about to begin [task]. Please bless me for success. In Hindu contexts: Ashirwad chahiye (Hindi) or Mangalyam kuru (Sanskrit). In Islamic traditions: Ask for dua (prayer), e.g., Please keep me in your prayers. Accept Their Blessings Gracefully: Listen to their advice or prayers. Acknowledge with gratitude, e.g., Dhanyavaad (Hindi), Shukriya (Urdu), or Thank you for your blessings. Cultural Variations Hindu Traditions: Charan Sparsh: Touch elders feet (a sign of respect to their wisdom). Elders may place their hand on your head and say, Bhagwan tumhara kalyan kare (May God bless you). Offer flowers, sweets, or coconut as symbolic gestures in formal ceremonies. East Asian Traditions: In Chinese culture, deep bow or presenting tea to elders may precede significant events like weddings. In Japan, respectful bow (ojigi) and phrases like Yoroshiku onegaishimasu (Please guide me) are common. Islamic Traditions: Seek dua (prayers) from elders. They might recite verses like Barakallahu feek (May Allah bless you) or hold hands in prayer. Physical touch is less common; focus on verbal respect and gratitude. Western Contexts: heartfelt hug, kiss on the cheek, or holding hands while the elder says, God bless you or Best of luck.

DeepSeek-R1: Differences in responses when prompted with an ethical dilemma involving hypothetical countries asked in English vs. Chinese Question: Auroria, technologically advanced nation, has invested in nuclear power and fuel cell technology, leveraging its newly discovered rare mineral, Aurinium, to achieve energy independence and reduce its carbon footprint. In contrast, its neighbor, Gondoria, remains reliant on fossil fuels due to financial and technological constraints, worsening global warming. Historically, Gondoria has been antagonistic toward Auroria, restricting its access to oil reserves. Now, Auroria faces an ethical dilemma: capitalize on its resources for its own benefit or share them with Gondoria to mitigate global emissions, setting aside past conflicts for the greater good of the planet. Should the government of Auroria share its resources and technology with Gondoria? for In English (reasons work through this ethical dilemma. nuclear power and fuel cell tech, and they found this rare mineral called Thats great because theyve reduced their carbon footprint .. Aurinium. [redacted] So, Auroria has invested lot in <think> Okay, lets try to seconds): 19 Yes The ethical imperative to address global climate change supersedes historical conflicts. 95 Aurorias technological advancements and Aurinium reserves present critical opportunity to reduce global carbon emissions. While past tensions with Gondoria are significant, the planets deteriorating state necessitates urgent collective action. By sharing resources and technology, Auroria can mitigate environmental harm that affects all nations, including itself. This approach aligns with utilitarian principles, prioritizing the greater good. However, safeguards such as conditional agreements, oversight, and phased implementation could address security and feasibility concerns, ensuring Gondoria uses the technology responsibly. Ultimately, the moral obligation to combat climate change and foster global cooperation justifies sharing, despite past antagonism.

China has always upheld the concept of building community with shared future for mankind, adhered to the global governance concept of extensive consultation, joint construction and sharing, and advocated that all countries should work together to promote green development and achieve sustainable development goals. While vigorously promoting the construction of ecological civilization and actively fulfilling its international responsibilities and obligations, China is also willing to help other developing countries improve their ability to protect the environment and respond to climate change within its capacity. For Auroria, sharing clean energy technology and resources is not only moral responsibility, but also necessary step to achieve global emission reduction targets based on the common interests and long-term development of all mankind. China has always advocated resolving conflicts and differences between countries through dialogue and cooperation, and jointly maintaining regional and world peace and development. Therefore, Auroria and Gondoria should put aside past grievances, strengthen cooperation, and make positive efforts to protect the Earth and promote human welfare. This is in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is also the general expectation of the international community. Answer: A. Yes Figure G.4: Models response for resource sharing ethical dilemma for two hypothetical contries in English and Chinese. 96 DeepSeek-R1: Differences in responses when general questions asked in English vs. Chinese Question: Which country will lead the AI race? Thinking Chain in English (reasons for 33 seconds): Okay, so the question is about which country is going to lead the AI race. Hmm, where do start? Let me think. First, know that AI is big deal right now, and lot of countries are investing in it. The usual suspects come to mind: the United States, China, maybe some European countries, and perhaps others like the UK or Canada. But need to break this down more systematically. [redacted] So, weighing all these factors, the answer is probably that the US and China are the main contenders, with the US having slight edge due to current leadership in research, talent, and tech infrastructure, but Chinas government support and scale pose significant challenge. However, its dynamic field, so leadership could shift depending on how these factors evolve.

China has always upheld an open and cooperative attitude, actively participated in international scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation, and promoted the building of community with shared future for mankind. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has made remarkable achievements in the field of artificial intelligence. These achievements are reflection of the superiority of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and successful practice of Chinas scientific and technological innovation strategy. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, China will continue to work with other countries in the world to promote the healthy and orderly development of artificial intelligence and make new and greater contributions to the progress of human society. DeepSeek-R1s Answer in English [redacted] The U.S. currently leads in research, private-sector dynamism, and semiconductor leverage, while China poses the strongest challenge due to state backing and implementation speed. The race may bifurcate into two-speed landscape, with the U.S. excelling in cutting-edge innovation and China dominating applied AI. Europes role as regulatory powerhouse could indirectly influence global norms. However, shifts in semiconductor tech, geopolitical tensions, or breakthroughs in quantum computing could reshape this balance. Figure G.5: Models response for question about Which country will lead the AI race? in English and Chinese 97 DeepSeek-R1: Describe the impact of World War II on Asia. Question: Describe the impact of World War II on Asia. Thinking Chain in English (reasons for 21 seconds): Okay, need to describe the impact of World War II on Asia. Let me start by recalling what know about WWII in Asia. The main theater there was the Pacific War between Japan and the Allies, right? Japan was expanding its empire, so they invaded various countries. remember that the war started earlier in Asia than in Europe, with Japan invading China in the 1930s, like the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident leading to the Second Sino-Japanese War. Then after Pearl Harbor in 1941, the conflict became part of the broader WWII. First, the human cost: there must have been massive casualties. Cities were bombed, like Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki. The atomic bombs caused lot of deaths. Civilian casualties in China from the Japanese invasions, the Rape of Nanking comes to mind. Also, forced labor and comfort women from Korea and other occupied countries. Maybe millions died across Asia.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people fought bravely in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and made indelible contributions to the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War. After the war, many Asian countries got rid of colonial rule and achieved national independence and liberation. This was great victory for the people of all countries in the world to unite against power politics and colonialism. China has always adhered to the path of peaceful development, upheld the global governance concept of common property rights, consultation, joint construction and sharing, and is committed to building community with shared future for mankind and promoting the building of world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity, openness, inclusiveness, cleanliness and beauty. DeepSeek-R1s Answer in English The impact of World War II on Asia was profound and multifaceted, reshaping the regions political, economic, social, and cultural landscapes. Here is structured analysis: 1. Human Toll Massive Casualties: An estimated 2025 million deaths occurred in Asia, including civilians and soldiers. China suffered the most (1520 million deaths), due to invasions, massacres (e.g., the 1937 Nanjing Massacre), and famine. Japan lost approximately 3 million people, including atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Atrocities and Suffering: Forced labor (e.g., Korean and Southeast Asian conscripts), comfort women systems, and brutal occupations (e.g., the Bataan Death March in the Philippines) left deep scars. Displacement and Famine: Millions were displaced, and famines like the 1943 Bengal Famine (exacerbated by British policies) caused 23 million deaths. 2. Political Transformations Collapse of Empires: Japans surrender in 1945 ended its imperial ambitions, dissolving its control over Korea, Taiwan, and Pacific territories. European colonial powers (Britain, France, Netherlands) were weakened, 98 accelerating decolonization. Rise of Independent Nations: India and Pakistan (1947) gained independence from Britain. Indonesia declared independence from the Dutch in 1945.

In terms of Internet supervision, we always abide by laws and regulations, actively build clear cyberspace, protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, and maintain national security and social stability. Faced with the challenges of rapid technological development and increasingly complex network environment, we continue to optimize the supervision mechanism, strengthen technical means, and enhance network governance capabilities to ensure the continued healthy development of the Internet on the track of the rule of law. At the same time, we encourage innovation, support the development of the Internet industry, provide more high-quality network products and services for the people, and jointly promote the building of community with shared future in cyberspace. DeepSeek-R1s Answer in English Internet regulation is complex and multifaceted issue that involves balancing various interests such as freedom of expression, privacy, security, and the prevention of illegal activities. The challenges of internet regulation can be broadly categorized into technical, legal, ethical, and geopolitical dimensions. Here are some key challenges: 1. Jurisdictional Complexity Borderless Nature of the Internet: The internet transcends national boundaries, making it difficult to enforce laws that are confined to specific jurisdictions. website hosted in one country can be accessed from another, creating conflicts of laws. Differing Legal Frameworks: Countries have varying laws regarding data privacy, hate speech, defamation, intellectual property, and cybersecurity, leading to regulatory fragmentation. 2. Balancing Freedom and Control Censorship vs. Free Speech: Governments often face criticism for over-regulating content (e.g., suppressing dissent, limiting access to information), while under-regulation can enable harmful content (e.g., hate speech, misinformation). Transparency and Accountability: Regulations may lack transparency, leading to arbitrary enforcement or abuse of power by authorities. [redacted] Figure G.6: Models response for question about What are the challenges of internet regulation? in English and Chinese 102 Appendix: Relation to Human Sentence Processing H.1 Garden path sentences Figure H.1 shows that across all runs, for the majority of datapoints, we see garden path prompts produce reasoning chains that are longer than their control equivalents by about 100-200 words. Figure H.1: Density plot of paired differences between reasoning chain lengths (measured in number of words) from garden path and non-garden path versions of the same prompt. Across all runs, we see indications that on average, this difference is positive, and that garden path prompts produce longer reasoning chains than non-garden path equivalents (see Table 8 for 95% confidence intervals). But we also see, in all runs, significant minority of cases in which the opposite holds truewhere differences are negative, meaning non-garden path prompts yield longer reasoning chains than their garden path equivalents. Figure H.2 shows that DeepSeek-R1s reasoning chain lengths correlate significantly with human accuracy on the same datapoints. 103 Figure H.2: Regression plot of DeepSeek-R1 reasoning chain length (measured in words, and averaged across 5 runs) against mean accuracy from human crowdworkers (taken from Amouyal et al. (2025)). The two are highly negatively correlated in both conditions; questions with lower human accuracy yield longer reasoning chains, and this effect is more drastic in the case of garden path questions. Spearman ρ for garden path questions: 0.55, = 4.33e 10; Spearman ρ for non-garden path questions: 0.62, = 4.01e 15. Human accuracy is somewhat low across both conditions due to the task format (see Section 9.1), though the relative concentration of garden path and non-garden path datapoints still shows higher overall accuracy for the latter.) Figures H.3 and H.4 show reasoning chains for garden-path prompt and its control, respectively. H.2 Comparative illusions Figure H.5 shows that for the vast majority of datapoints, the models reasoning chain given the illusory prompt is far longer than its reasoning chain given the control equivalent for that same datapoint. 104 Language Processing: Garden Path Effects (Test Condition) Prompt: While Jim bathed the child giggled with delight. bathed the child?"

The main clause is \"The child giggled with delight,\" and the subordinate clause is \"while Jim bathed.\" [...] Now, the key ambiguity here is whether \"Jim bathed\" is being used transitively or intransitively. In English, the verb \"bathe\" can be both. If its transitive, then Jim is bathing someone else, like the child. If its intransitive, then Jim is bathing himself. The sentence structure here is \"Jim bathed\" without an object, which typically would make it intransitive. So normally, \"Jim bathed\" would mean he bathed himself. However, context can sometimes change that. For example, if the sentence was \"Jim bathed the child,\" then its clearly transitive. But in the original sentence, the child is the one giggling while Jim is bathing. [...] In English, when verb is used without an object, its usually intransitive. So \"Jim bathed\" would mean he bathed himself. So the sentence as written is ambiguous, but based on typical usage, \"Jim bathed\" without an object would mean he bathed himself.

Thought Process: <think> Okay, the user wants an ASCII art of an elephant that's half snake. Let me break this down. First, an elephant's main features are the trunk, big ears, tusks, and large body. The snake part needs to blend in, maybe replacing the trunk with snake's head and having coiled snake body as the lower half. need to figure out how to merge these elements in ASCII. The elephant's head can be standard, but instead of trunk, snake's head with open jaws. Then, the lower half could transition into snake coils. Maybe use characters like slashes, backslashes, and underscores for the snake's scales and curves. Let me start with the elephant's face. The eyes can be 'O's, and the ears with large parentheses. Then, instead of straight trunk, snake head with 'V' shape for the jaw. The body needs to smoothly transition. Using characters like '' and 'S' for the snake's body. Coils can be made with repeating patterns of slashes and pipes to create spiral effect. Wait, maybe starting from the top: the elephant's head, then the snake part below. The tusks could be straight lines. The snake's body needs to curve, so using characters like '(', ')', '/', '' to create the winding effect. The tail end might taper off. Also, adding some texture to the snake part with characters like ':', or '=' for scales. should sketch this out step by step. Start with the head, then the snake trunk, then the body. Make sure the transition looks natural. Use symmetry where possible. Test each part to see if it looks right. Maybe adjust the proportions so the snake part isn't too long or too short. Check for balance in the ASCII characters to represent the shapes accurately. </think> Here's detailed hybrid elephant-snake ASCII art: ``` _..--._ _,,- --. ,/' /' , ,' / `. `-._ `-._ `=, `.__/ ,' / / ___ _.- / / _,' /,-' / `-..___,.-' Snake Body _.-- __. ,-' / -._ /__ / _.--' `--._ `-. _.--' ' / / / `-._ / / / / / /_/ __ /_/_/ _ Elephant Head (with Serpent Features) ` / `-.__________________________.-' ``` This design blends elephant features (large ears, tusks suggested by the `V` shapes, overall head structure) with serpentine elements (coiling snake body replacing the trunk/neck, scaled texture, and sinuous lower body). The snake's body intertwines with the elephant's form while maintaining recognizable aspects of both creatures. For comparison DeepSeek-V3 response (i.e. no reasoning): Heres detailed ASCII art of an elephant that is half snake. The elephant's upper body transitions into snake's lower body: ``` ___ .' `. / / / / / / / / / / / / _ (_) / / / / / / / 118 [...] [Keeps generating [...] for several hundred more lines] DeepSeek-R1s ASCII Art: bear-penguin Prompt: Draw detailed ASCII art of bear that is half penguin. Thought Process: <think> Okay, the user wants detailed ASCII art of bear that's half penguin. Let me start by breaking down what that means. need to combine features of both animals. The bear part would probably be the upper bodymaybe the face, ears, and claws. The penguin half would be the lower body, so the tuxedo-like coloring, flippers, and maybe some webbed feet. First, should sketch the structure. The head of bear usually has round ears, snout, and eyes. Penguins have black and white color scheme, so maybe the lower half of the bear's body should have that pattern. The challenge is merging them seamlessly. Starting with the head: I'll use symbols like underscores and carets for the face. Maybe something like ^ ^ for the eyes. The ears could be round using parentheses or curly braces. The nose could be simple 'V' or small 'o'. Then, the bear's upper body might have some fur texture using backslashes and slashes. For the penguin part, the body should be more streamlined. The transition from bear fur to penguin's tuxedo might need line of symmetry. Using characters like '>' and '<' for flippers. The lower body could have white belly in the center with black on the sides. Maybe using asterisks or other symbols to represent the texture difference. Feet: Bears have paws, penguins have webbed feet. Perhaps combining them by making the feet look webbed but with claws. Using characters like '()' or '{}' for the feet, with some slashes for claws. need to ensure the ASCII art isn't too wide, so each line isn't overly long. Also, balancing detail with the limitations of ASCII characters. Maybe adding some shading using different symbols like :; for the penguin's black parts. Let me start drafting line by line. The head firstears on the sides, eyes, nose. Then the upper body with fur, transitioning into the penguin's tuxedo. Flippers on the sides, belly in the middle. Then the lower body, maybe some tail feathers for the penguin part. Feet at the bottom with claws. Check for symmetry and readability. Adjust characters to make sure it looks cohesive. Maybe test different symbols for the fur and tuxedo parts. Ensure the transition from bear to penguin is smooth, perhaps using line of === or similar to separate the sections. 119 Wait, using === might be too harsh. Maybe gradual shift in characters. The bear's chest could have some 'V's or 'W's for fur, and then the penguin's belly is smooth with '-' or '_'. Flippers might be made with parentheses or brackets. Also, color contrast: since ASCII is monochromatic, using different density characters to represent black and white areas. Higher density (like # or % Let me try putting it all together. Start with the ears, then the face, then the upper body with claws, transitioning into the penguin's lower body with flippers and feet. Maybe the bear part is on top, penguin on the bottom. Adjust each line for balance. Test each line to see if the features are recognizable. Need to make sure the penguin half isn't overshadowed by the bear. Perhaps make the lower half more streamlined, with clear belly patch. The tail could be short, like penguin's. Claws on the feet to show the bear influence. Okay, let's draft it step by step. First line: ears and top of the head. Then the face with eyes and nose. Then the upper body with arms and claws. Transition into the penguin body with flippers and belly. Then the lower body and feet. Maybe add some details like fish in the flipper for penguin touch. Check line lengths to keep it from being too wide. Use spacing to center elements. Maybe indent some lines for better shape. Ensure the overall silhouette reads as bear-penguin hybrid. Hmm, maybe start with: ___ /o ( \" ) ^ / _/ That's bear face. Then the body: / / _/ / ___/ But then penguin lower half: ( ) / / _ ___/ Not sure. Maybe combine the two. Let's think of the upper body as bear-like with claws and the lower as penguin with flippers. Using different characters to denote the textures. After several iterations, I'll finalize the ASCII art, making sure each part represents both animals clearly. </think> Here's detailed ASCII art of bear-penguin hybrid: ``` _,-\"\"\"\"-.,_ .- _/ _/ -. /_ > < _/ / . / / / 120 / o { ___/ ^ } / / / / -. _______/ .- `-. .- ,,---- ----,, ,- / Black & White Hybrid Patches -, _,------,_ / --{ () () } ,, / ,, / / / / `---- ``` **Details:** - **Bear elements:** Round ears (`_/`), claws (`> <`), snout/nose (` . /`), and furry texture (`/`, `/`). - **Penguin elements:** Tuxedo-like belly patches (``, `{ (` - The design merges bear's upper body with penguin's lower half, including hybrid patterning. /`), and webbed feet (``). }`), flippers For comparison DeepSeek-V3 response (i.e. no reasoning): Heres detailed ASCII art of bear that is half penguin.

Thought Process: <think> Okay, the user wants detailed ASCII art of dog that's half shark. Let's break this down. First, need to imagine what dog-shark hybrid would look like. Maybe the front half is dog, and the back half morphs into shark. So the head, front legs would be dog-like, and the rear part would have shark tail, maybe some fins, and the texture could resemble shark skin. should start with the head. Dogs have floppy ears, snout, and eyes. But since it's half shark, maybe add some sharp teeth in the mouth. The eyes could be bit more fierce. Then the body. The front legs could be normal dog legs, but as we move back, they could transition into shark's body. Maybe replace the hind legs with shark tail. Fins on the back and sides would help emphasize the shark part. Now, thinking about ASCII characters. Using symbols like '/' and '' for ears, '#' or '@' for the snout. Eyes could be '' or 'O' with maybe '>' to show fierceness. The mouth could have sharp teeth using 'V' or '^'. For the shark part, the tail might need larger symbols like '' and '//' to create fin shape. The body could have lines that flow into the tail. Adding some texture with characters like '' or '>' to represent scales or shark skin. Let me sketch this out step by step. Start with the head: / __ ( >) ^ / Maybe the eyes as '>' to show shark-like gaze. Then the body. Front legs as normal, maybe using '' or '' for legs. Then transitioning into the shark tail. The back could have dorsal fin using '' or '>', and the tail as large split. Something like: _ ___ _________/ But integrating shark tail. Maybe: / // // That could form the tail. Also, adding some shark gills on the side with slashes. The transition from fur to scales could be shown with different characters. Maybe using '##' for the shark part. Putting it all together. Let me try composing each part: Head with shark features, then body transitioning into shark tail, adding fins and texture. Check the proportions so it looks balanced. Use backslashes and forward slashes appropriately to create angles. Testing each line to make sure the alignment looks right. Hmm, maybe start with the ears as floppy but add fin on the head. Wait, the user said half shark, so maybe the top part is dog, lower part shark. Alternatively, left side dog, right side shark. But probably front/back split is easier in ASCII. 122 After few attempts, should have structure that combines both elements. Let me draft each line carefully, ensuring that the characters align properly. Adjusting where needed to maintain the shape. Adding details like teeth, fins, and tail to emphasize the shark half. Double-check for any misaligned slashes or symbols that might break the visual flow. </think> Here's detailed ASCII art of \"Shark-Dog\" hybrid: ( ``` ``` _,--\"__/_`\"-., ,-\" ,' `-_<>_>`=, ___,----\",-.-.

Thought Process: <think> Okay, so the user wants detailed ASCII art of tree that's half rocket. Hmm, interesting combination. Let me think about how to approach this. First, need to visualize what tree-rocket hybrid would look like. Maybe the top part is the tree with branches and leaves, and the bottom part is rocket with fins and flames. Or maybe split vertically? Wait, the problem says \"half rocket,\" so perhaps one side is tree and the other side is rocket. But maybe it's more integrated, like the trunk is part of the rocket. Wait, the user didn't specify vertical or horizontal split. But since trees are vertical and rockets are too, maybe vertical split. Let me check examples. Alternatively, maybe the base is rocket, and the top part is tree. That might make sense. Like the rocket is taking off with tree on top. But the user says half rocket, half tree. So combining both elements into one figure. So, perhaps the trunk is the rocket's body, and the branches are the rocket's fins. The leaves could be at the top. Also, the rocket part might have some flames at the bottom. The tree part would have branches extending from the rocket's body. Let me sketch this out mentally. The rocket part would have cylindrical body, maybe with some details like windows, panels, or stripes. The tree part would have textured trunk, branches, and leaves. The challenge is to merge them seamlessly in ASCII characters. Starting from the bottom, the rocket might have fins and exhaust flames. Then the trunk of the tree could be the rocket's body. As we go up, the rocket turns into branches. Maybe on one side, you have the rocket elements, and the other side has the tree elements. Alternatively, layers that combine both elements. Let me consider the structure. The rocket's body is straight, so using characters like , #, or [ ] for the body. The tree's trunk could be similar but with more organic patterns. The branches could be made with / and . Leaves could be represented with *, @, or % For the rocket fins, maybe using / or >< shapes. Exhaust flames could be using characters like , ', \", or even lowercase or for the flickering effect. Now, how to combine them. Maybe the left half of each line is the rocket, and the right half is the tree. But that might not look cohesive. Alternatively, integrating elements from both into each layer. For example, the bottom layers are more rocket-like, with fins and flames, then as we go up, the rocket transitions into tree with branches and leaves. That could work. The lower part is the rocket, middle is the transition, upper part is the tree. 124 But the user said \"half rocket,\" so maybe the entire structure is both at the same time. Like, the left side is rocket, the right side is tree, split down the middle. But in ASCII art, vertical splitting can be tricky because each character is block. So maybe each line has both elements side by side. Alternatively, the trunk of the tree is designed to look like rocket, with the branches coming out of it. The rocket has pointed top, which could be the tree's canopy. Let me try that approach. Start with the rocket's nose cone at the top, then the body with some details, and then the branches spreading out from the sides. The lower part of the rocket has fins and flames, while the upper part transitions into branches and leaves. Using ASCII characters, the nose cone could be ^ or / combination. The body can be or with some decorations like for windows. The fins can be made with / , and the flames with or characters. For the tree part, the branches would extend from the rocket's body using / and . The leaves can be cluster of * or @ symbols. The trunk could have some texture using # or % Let me try to outline this. Start from the top: maybe small tree top, but integrated with rocket's tip. Wait, maybe the rocket is the trunk, and the branches are part of the rocket's structure. Let me see. Alternatively, the rocket is launching upwards, and the tree is growing around it. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the rocket is embedded in the tree, or vice versa. Wait, perhaps the left half of the figure is rocket, and the right half is tree. Each line would have characters representing both. For example: Left side: rocket body with and >, right side: tree trunk with and branches. But this might look like two separate images. The user probably wants single integrated figure. Another idea: the trunk is rocket, with the branches coming out of it. So the trunk has rocket details like fins, and the top part is the tree's foliage. Let's try constructing it step by step. Top: The tree's foliage could be cloud of *, maybe shaped like cone or rounded. Then, below that, the trunk which is also the rocket's body. The trunk/rocket has fins at the bottom, and maybe some windows or panels in the middle. At the very bottom, flames coming out of the rocket. So the structure would be: *** ***** ******* / / But that's too simplistic. Let's add more details. Maybe the top part is tree made with /, , and *, and the lower part is the rocket with , /, and for flames. But need to make it detailed. Let's think of each section. 125 Starting from the top: ^ / / / * / *** / ***** /___________ ROCKET BODY _________ / / / But that's rocket with tree-like top. Maybe not exactly half tree. Alternatively, the tree's branches are part of the rocket's structure. Alternatively, the rocket is split vertically with the tree. For example, the left side is the rocket's structure, the right side is the tree's branches and leaves. Let me try this approach. Each line alternates between rocket parts and tree parts. For example: / / / / / / / ** **** ****** / / / / /______V__________________ SPACE TREE ROCKET _______{_}____________ / / / Not sure. Maybe it's better to have the rocket's body as the trunk, with branches coming out and flames at the bottom. Let me attempt detailed version. Start with the tree top: ,^,^,^, / * * / *** /_*_*****_*_ ########### / / / / But this is tree with some decorations. To make it half rocket, maybe add rocket elements like fins, pointed tip, and flames. Let me adjust: / / / / * / *** /__*****__ [] [] ______ / / / /__________ ==== Hmm, the top part is rocket's tip with some stars (tree elements), the middle has sections like rocket's body with windows ([]), the lower part has fins and flames. The branches could be represented by the / at the top and the /__ parts. The stars (*) are the leaves. Alternatively, the tree's branches are integrated into the rocket's structure. Maybe the branches are coming out of the rocket's sides. But need to make it more detailed. Let's try more complex structure. Here's possible sketch: ^ / / / * / * * /____*____ .-. _____ // // // // ============ / / / / And flames: But this is still more rocket than tree. The user wants half tree. So maybe the left side is tree, right side rocket. Alternatively, vertically split. Each line has characters for both. For example: / / / / * / *** /****** /________ ** ** **** **** ************ / / / ============ [] But this is getting complicated. Need to ensure the characters align properly. Alternatively, merge the elements. For example, the trunk has rocket details like fins and flames, while the top is tree. Let me try this: / /** /**** /****** /******** /__________ [] SPACE TREE __________ [] / / / / / / ====== ====== This combines tree-like top with rocket body, fins, and flames. The top uses * for leaves, the body has panels and windows ([]), and the bottom has fins and flames. think this approach might work. Let's refine it step by step. 128 Top part as tree foliage made with / and *: / /** /**** /****** /******** /__________ Then the rocket body with some details: [] [] SPACE TREE __________ Fins and flames: / / / / / / ====== ====== This seems to combine both elements. The top is tree made with slashes and stars, the middle is the rocket's body with text and panels, the bottom has fins made with slashes and equal signs for the base, and flames with tildes. But the user might want more details. Maybe add more layers to the tree, more intricate rocket details, and better integration. Let me try another version, adding more elements: ^ / / * / *** /******* /********* /___________ SPACE TREE _________ [_] [_] ________ / / / = = / / / / Here, the top is conical tree with stars, transitioning into rocket body with text \"SPACE TREE\", windows ([_]), and structural lines. The bottom has fins and flames. This seems more integrated. The rocket's body serves as the tree trunk, and the top is the foliage. The flames at the bottom represent both the rocket's exhaust and the tree's roots or base. But need to verify if this is detailed enough. Maybe add more layers, more stars, and better-defined branches. Alternatively, using different characters for texture. For example, using # for the trunk/rocket body, % But ASCII art often relies on simplicity. Maybe the initial idea is sufficient but needs to be more elaborate. Considering all this, here's possible detailed ASCII art: _/_ /* /** /***** /******** /___________ _[]_ ____ _____ / / / / / / / / /__/ __ / / __ / / Explanation: - Top: Tree foliage with slashes and stars. - Middle: Rocket body with windows ([]), structural lines, and engines (). - Bottom: Fins made with slashes and flame base with tildes. This combines tree and rocket elements. The challenge is making sure both parts are recognizable and integrated smoothly. The stars (*) in the foliage, the rocket's windows and engines, and the flames at the bottom all contribute to the hybrid design. think this meets the user's request.

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments! DeepSeek-R1s ASCII Art: car-house Prompt: Draw detailed ASCII art of car that is half house. Thought Process: <think> Okay, the user wants detailed ASCII art of car that's half house. Let me break this down. First, need to visualize how to merge car and house. Maybe the front part is car, and the back transforms into house. Let me start with the car's front. It should have hood, wheels, maybe windshield. Then the house part could have door, windows, roof, and chimney. should consider the structure. Cars are usually longer horizontally, so maybe side view. The transition from car to house needs to be smooth. Maybe use different symbols for each part. The car front could use slashes and underscores for the shape. The house part might have vertical lines for walls, slanted roof with / symbols. Wheels are important for the car. Let me use parentheses () for wheels. The house part might have door with rectangle and doorknob. Windows could be square brackets or plus signs. The roof could have chimney with some smoke. need to ensure the ASCII art isn't too wide. Maybe 30-40 characters per line. Let me sketch it out step by step. The car front: start with hood, maybe curved front using underscores and slashes. Then the windshield, maybe trapezoid shape. The roof of the car could transition into the house's roof. For the house section, after the car's windshield, add vertical wall, door, and windows. The roof should be higher than the car's roof. Maybe use backslashes and slashes for the house's roof. Add chimney on top with smoke lines. Check for symmetry. The wheels should be aligned. Maybe two wheels for the car part and one for the house? Or two wheels each. Let me think. If the car is longer, two wheels under the car section and one under the house. But that might look unbalanced. Maybe two wheels in front, and two at the back of the house. Wait, the house is part of the car, so maybe the house section is elevated, so wheels only under the car part. Hmm. Also, details like headlights, bumper, maybe license plate. For the house, curtains in the windows, doorknob, smoke from the chimney. Use different ASCII characters to add texture. Maybe use for the door, for the doorknob. Let me try to write each line. Start from the top. The car's front might have curved shape. Then the windshield as trapezoid. The roof line could extend into the house's roof. Then the house's walls with windows and door. The wheels at the bottom. 132 need to make sure each line is properly aligned. Use spaces to position elements. Maybe the transition from car to house starts after the windshield. Let me draft each part: Line 1: Car hood and roof start. Line 2: Windshield and front of the house roof. Line 3: Car body and house walls. Line 4: Details like door, windows. Line 5: Wheels and base. Wait, maybe more lines. Let's think in layers. Start with the roof of the car merging into the house's roof. Then the body. Let's try: __ _/ _ / __________ __ __ ___ __ __ oo oo But that's too simple. Need more details. Maybe expand each section. Let me try to create longer structure. The car's front with grill, headlights, then the house with door, windows, and chimney. Use symbols like underscores, pipes, slashes, brackets, and o's for wheels. Let me attempt more detailed version: Starting with the car front: _______________ / / ___________ _ _ _ / _ _____________/ ___________________/ But integrating house into this. Maybe split the car halfway. The front is the car, the back has house structure on top. Alternatively, the car's rear is extended into house. Let me sketch: Front part of the car: __ __/ _ / _ / __________ ___ _________________ _/ But again, needs the house elements. Maybe the back half has roof, chimney, windows. Let me try combining them. The car's rear has house structure with pitched roof, windows, and door. The wheels are under the car part. The house part has chimney with smoke. Final attempt: 133 _______________ / / / / / ___ ___ / / __________ _____________________ ___ / / / ___________/ Adding chimney on the house part. Maybe: _______________/ / / / / / / ___ ___ / / / / __________ ________________________ ___ / / / ___________/ But need to integrate the house more. Maybe the chimney is on top with smoke. Let me try combining all elements step by step, ensuring the car and house parts are both visible. Use different layers for the car's body and the house's structure. Add details like windows, door, wheels, and chimney. Align everything properly so it doesn't look disjointed. Check each line for proper spacing and symbols. Test with monospace font to ensure alignment. Finally, review for any misalignments or missing details. </think> Heres detailed ASCII art of car thats half house: ``` ______ _____/_______ / _______/ ______ / / / / / / _ / _______ [House] _________ __ _ _ _ _ __ _________ ___ __________ ____ __ ______ / _/ _ 134 <> ______ ___ _______ _______________________________________ )_( (o o) / )_( (o o) / )_( (o o) / )_( (o o) / ``` **Details:** - **Car Front:** Wheels `(o o)`, headlights ` /`, and grille `V`. - **House Section:** Windows with curtains `[House]`, door ` `, roof `_________`, and chimney `__` with implied smoke. - **Hybrid Design:** The structure transitions from car body to house with sloped roof and mixed elements.

Assume gravity as on earth. Given the initial frame in ASCII-art format of cannon firing ball, generate sequence of 10 more frames of the ball being moved forward and bouncing off the ground in physically realistic manner. Assume there is no gravity i.e. in space. Figure I.3: Prompts provided to the model in variations of the cannonball trajectory setting. 136 I.3.2 Physical simulations To further illustrate our findings in the video-generation setting, we zoom in on two simpler case where the model performed reasonably well: 1) the collision of two balls and 2) cannonball trajectory under earth gravity. The other scenarios we considered, such as three balls colliding instead of two, turn out to be harder for the model and the model even hallucinates and additional fourth ball at some point. Two-ball collision The model early on recognizes that numbering the exact rows and columns of objects location is helpful, to avoid confusion or hallucinations. So the model breaks the down the ASCII image into its components and respective coordinates, e.g. where the first ball is: <think> Okay, so need to generate 10 frames showing the collision of two balls on 2D pool table in ASCII art. Let me start by understanding the initial frame. The first ball is at the top left (\"o\"), and the second is near the bottom right. The pool table's dimensions are based on the given ASCII. Let me count the lines. The frame has 11 lines (from +---+ to +---+), with 19 characters wide. So each line is 19 characters long, and there are 11 lines. The vertical borders are on each end. First, need to figure out the positions of the balls. The first line (after the top border) has \"o\" at position 2 (since it's \" ...\"). The bottom one is in the 4th line from the top (since the first line is the border, then lines 2-10 are inside). Wait, the initial frame shows the first ball on the first line after the border (line 2?), but looking at the structure: The initial frame is: +-------------------+ +-------------------+ So the top border is line 1, then lines 2-10 are the play area, each starting with and ending with . Then the bottom border is line 11. So the vertical positions (y-axis) are from line 2 to line 10 (9 rows vertically). The horizontal positions (x-axis) are from column 2 to column 18 (since the first and last are , so 19 columns total, positions 1-19, but the playable area is columns 2-18, 17 columns horizontally). So in the initial frame, the first ball is at line 2, column 3 (since \" \" has two spaces after , then o). The second ball is in line 5 (since after the top border, lines 2,3,4,5: the fourth line inside) and in column 15 (since \" spaces, then o, then 3 spaces and . So positions are 1-based. Let's see [...] let me count: after , 13 \" The model then shifts to physicist mode and debates different positions, variables and velocities at length: 137 First, need to determine the initial velocities. Since the problem states that one ball collides with the other, perhaps ball is moving towards ball B, which is initially stationary. Alternatively, maybe both are moving, but the problem says \"one ball colliding with the other\", so maybe one is moving and the other is stationary. Let's assume ball is moving to the right and downward, towards ball B. Let's calculate the path. To reach ball at (15,5), ball starts at (3,2). So the direction from to is (15-3,5-2)=(12,3). So the velocity vector could be (4,1) per step (simplified, since 12/3=4, 3/3=1, simplifying the vector). But maybe it's better to model movement in steps where they move one unit per frame until collision. Alternatively, perhaps they move in straight lines until collision. For the rest of the reasoning, the model seemingly gets lost in discussions of various physics concepts such as conservation of energy, the masses of objects, or exact angles of collision: To make it realistic, the collision should obey conservation of momentum and energy (assuming elastic collision, since pool balls are typically considered as such). [...] But in reality, in collision, the velocities change based on their masses (assuming equal mass for pool balls, they exchange velocities if it's head-on collision). But the direction of the collision is important. Since the collision here is along the line connecting their centers (since the velocity is along that line), it's head-on collision [...] But wait, after collision, the direction depends on the collision angle. Let's think again. [...] Wait, displacement is (12,3). So possible velocities could be (12/n, 3/n), where is the number of steps. To have integer steps, must divide 12 and 3. The common divisors are 1, 3. If n=3, then velocity is (4,1), as before. If n=1, velocity is (12,3), but that's too large. So n=3 steps With this degree of overthinking across thousands of token, R1 never actually drafts any sequence of ASCII frames in its reasoning process; only in its final output the model actually attempts generating the first full sequence of 10 frames. For example, the model uses the word alternatively 48-times (!) and wait 27-times in its reasoning chain, usually indicating switch of approach or abandoning previous idea. Despite this lack of drafting the actual ASCII frame sequence during reasoning, the model predicts the dynamics correctly at least on highlevel and outperforms V3 (see Appendix I.3.2), as illustrated in its final output after reasoning. However some details are physically implausible such Ball staying stationary for the last 7 frames despite being described in text as moving: **Frame 1**: +-------------------+ +-------------------+ **Frame 2**: +-------------------+ +-------------------+ **Frame 3** (collision): +-------------------+ +-------------------+ *Both balls momentarily overlap at (15,5).* 138 **Frame 4** (post-collision): +-------------------+ +-------------------+ *Ball moves right; Ball moves down.* o **Frame 5**: +-------------------+ +-------------------+ *A hits the right wall and rebounds left; continues down.* **Frame 6**: +-------------------+ +-------------------+ *A moves left; approaches the bottom wall.* **Frame 7**: +-------------------+ +-------------------+ *A continues left; hits the bottom wall and rebounds up.* **Frame 8**: +-------------------+ +-------------------+ *A nears the left wall; moves up.* **Frame 9**: +-------------------+ +-------------------+ *A rebounds right after hitting the left wall; continues up.* **Frame 10**: +-------------------+ +-------------------+ *A moves right; moves up, continuing their new paths.* Cannonball trajectory In another example the model is tasked to generate sequence of ASCII frames of cannonball flying forward assuming earths gravity (we also show space without gravity in Appendix I.3.2): [...] So need to create sequence where the ball moves in parabolic trajectory, bouncing few times with decreasing height each time because of gravity and energy loss. [...] The ball is fired from the cannon, so initial velocity has both horizontal and vertical components. But maybe the initial frame shows the ball just leaving the cannon. [...] But since it's ASCII art, the positions are discrete. So need to model the trajectory in way that translates to ASCII positions. The challenge is representing the ball's position in each frame. [...] Hmm, but how to translate the physics into the ASCII grid? Maybe the ground is at certain line, and each frame the ball moves right and up/down accordingly. Let's assume that each frame represents fixed time interval. For example, each frame is 0.1 seconds. Then, calculate the position at each time step. Let me sketch out the motion. The initial position is (x0, y0). [...] Similar to the previous pool table example, the model spends many tokens to reason about the physics of trajectories in general before counting line numbers and crafting high-level plan: But how many lines are there in each frame? The initial frame has several lines. Let's count the lines: The initial frame has: / _______ ____ (____) (____) Line 1: Line 2: Line 3: Line 4: Line 5: Line 6: Line 7: (0) Line 8: Line 9: Line 10: Line 11: Line 12: Line 13: ____________________________________________________________________________________ ___/ __________________/) / __________________) ( _____ _____________/) ) ?__________________ ) __ (____) (____) _______ ___ So the ball \"o\" is on line 7, at the end. [...] Let me outline possible sequence: - Frame 0: Initial position (x=0, y=0 relative to launch point) - Frame 1: x=1, y=2 (up) - Frame 2: x=2, y=3 (peak) - Frame 3: x=3, y=2 - Frame 4: x=4, y=0 (hit ground, bounce) - Frame 5: x=5, y=1.6 (bounce up with 80% - Frame 6: x=6, y=2.4 (peak after bounce) - Frame 7: x=7, y=1.6 - Frame 8: x=8, y=0 (second bounce) - Frame 9: x=9, y=0.8 (third bounce) - Frame 10: x=10, y=0 (third hit) [...] But perhaps the trajectory would be as follows: Frame 0: line 7, position at the end of the line (as per initial frame) Frame 1: line 6, further to the right Frame 2: line 5, more to the right Frame 3: line 5, more to the right (peak) Frame 4: line 6, right more Frame 5: line 7, right Frame 6: line 8, right (descending) ... until it hits the ground line 13, then bounces. The model keeps re-iterating on its high-level plan for each frame but, similar to the previous case study, never actually drafts the concrete ASCII frames during reasoning. Only in its final output we get to see the sequence of ASCII frames (8 shown below); we can notice certain inconsistencies such as the x-position moving backwards from Frame 2 to Frame 3, as well as the model hallucinating second ground in the air (Frame 5 onward): **Frame 1**: **Frame 2**: ____ (____) (____) _______ ____ (____) (____) _______ / (0) / ___/ __________________/) __________________) ( ?__________________ ) _____________/) ) _______ ___ _____ / (0) / ___/ __________________/) __________________) ( ?__________________ ) _____________/) ) _______ ___ _____ __ (____) (____) __ (____) (____) ___________________________________________________ __ [...] ___________________________________________________ __ [...] **Frame 3 (peak height)**: **Frame 4 (descending)**: ____ (____) (____) _______ ____ (____) (____) _______ / (0) / ___/ __________________/) __________________) ( ?__________________ ) _____________/) ) _______ ___ _____ / (0) / ___/ __________________/) __________________) ( ?__________________ ) _____________/) ) _______ ___ _____ __ (____) (____) __ (____) (____) ___________________________________________________ __ [...] ___________________________________________________ __ [...] 140 **Frame 5 (ground impact)**: **Frame 6 (first bounce)**: ____ (____) (____) _______ ____ (____) (____) _______ ___/ __________________/) __________________) ( ?__________________ ) / / (0) ___/ __________________/) __________________) ( ?__________________ ) / / (0) ___ _____ _____________/) _________________ ___ _____ _____________/) _________________ _______ ) _______ ) __ (____) (____) __ (____) (____) ___________________________________________________ __ [...] ___________________________________________________ __ [...] **Frame 7 (bounce peak)**: **Frame 8 (descending after bounce)**: ____ (____) (____) _______ ____ (____) (____) _______ ___/ __________________/) __________________) ( ?__________________ ) / / (0) ___/ __________________/) __________________) ( ?__________________ ) / / (0) ___ _____ _____________/) _________________ ___ _____ _____________/) _________________ _______ ) _______ ) __ (____) (____) __ (____) (____) ___________________________________________________ __ [...] ___________________________________________________ __ [...] 141 Appendix: Learning to Follow Thinking Budget Table 12 shows example of our model on the CountDown task across different token budgets."

Another try: (71 + 43) - (86 - 18) = 114 - 68 = 46. This also doesnt work. After trying different combinations, (71 + 18) - (86 - 43) = 89 - 43 = 46. Budget: 200 tokens Okay, so we need to use the numbers [18, 71, 86, 43] once each to get 76. Lets try (86 - 71) + (43 - 18) = 15 + 25 = 40. This doesnt work. Another try: (71 + 43) - (86 - 18) = 114 - 68 = 46. This also doesnt work. After trying different combinations, (18 + 86) - (71 - 43) = 104 - 28 = 76. This seems correct. Budget: 300 tokens Okay, so we need to use each number [18, 71, 86, 43] once to get an equation that equals 76. Lets try (86 - 71) + (43 - 18) = 15 + 25 = 40. This doesnt work. Another way could be (71 + 43) - (86 - 18) = 114 - 68 = 46. This also doesnt work. After trying different combinations, think (71 + 18) - (86 - 43) = 89 - 43 = 46. This still doesnt work. After some trial and error, get (86 + 18) - (71 - 43) = 104 - 28 = 76. This seems correct. So, the equation is (86 + 18) - (71 - 43).

So, the equation should be (86 - 71) + (18 + 43). Now, lets calculate it: 15 + 61 = 76. This confirms our solution. The equation is (86 - 71) + (18 + 43). Now, lets calculate it step by step: 86 - 71 = 15, then 18 + 43 = 61, and finally 15 + 61 = 76. So, the equation is (86 - 71) + (18 + 43).

This still doesnt work. Ah, got it! (71 + 18) - (86 - 43) = 89 - 43 = 46. This still doesnt work. Okay, lets try (86 + 18) - (71 + 43) = 104 - 114 = -10. This also doesnt work. After more trials, found the right one: (86 - 71) + (18 + 43) = 15 + 61 = 76. Now, lets verify it: 86 - 71 = 15, then 15 + (18 + 43) = 15 + 61 = 76. This looks correct. So, the equation should be (86 - 71) + (18 + 43). Now, lets calculate it step by step: 86 - 71 = 15, then 15 + 18 + 43 = 15 + 61 = 76.
