            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Generating high-quality toonified avatar videos is long-studied topic in computer vision and computer graphics, with applications in daily life, social media, movies, and video game character creation. Recently, generative models have shown great promise in creating stylized portrait videos. For instance, VToonify [Yang et al. 2022] uses learnable StyleGAN [Karras et al. 2020, 2019] to translate the specific portrait videos into different style via pre-collection images. AvatarStudio [Pan et al. 2023] edits dynamic facial appearances by score distillation sampling [Shi et al. 2023] from multi-view camera views. However, existing methods face challenges such as re-animation issues, low quality, and inference inefficiency, limiting their use in consumer applications. An ideal toonification avatar generation system should meet the following principles: Text Toonification: Text is widely used for providing instructions in everyday activities, requiring minimal expert knowledge. Consequently, user-friendly system can generate the corresponding appearance based on user-input instructions, without pre-collection data or annotations. Generalizability to the Driven Signal: The toonified avatar generated should have the capability to be controlled by arbitrary identites with varying head motions and expressions. Rapid Adaptation and Real-time Animation: The model should swiftly adjust to the desired style following user-input instructions within few minutes. Once adapted, real-time animation should be achievable on consumer devices. To achieve the above principles, we propose an effective method named TextToon for head avatar toonification. Inspired by Triplane based neural volumetric representation, we use normalized orthographic rendering as the conditional Tri-plane inputs for 3D Gaussian points properties. The 3D Gaussian points, which control dynamic head expressions in the canonical space, are influenced not only by the linear deformations from 3DMM coefficients but also by the learnable Tri-plane features. However, since 3DMM is linear model with limited facial expression capacity, we utilize the Tri-plane neural network structure to adaptively learn the mapping between the condition rendering and the corresponding stylized appearance in canonical space. Specifically, the normalized orthographic rendering map and 3DMM mesh deformed by expression 2 provide coarse representation of Gaussian point clouds. The finegrained topology structure results from further displacement of the coarse points positions by the learned Tri-plane features. For head motion, the estimated rotation and translation matrix are multiplied by each Gaussian points property to achieve full movement. Although the conditional Tri-plane-based 3D Gaussian Splatting significantly improves the accuracy of stylized facial expression representation, the toonification approaches still suffers from poor visual quality. For example, the inconsistencies in the diffusion-based Text-to-Image (T2I) editor [Aneja et al. 2023; MÃ¼ller et al. 2022; Shen et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2023b] result in unclear and over-smoothed rendering outcomes [Shao et al. 2023]. To address this issue, we employ patch-aware contrastive learning manner in the fine-tuning phrase. Specifically, the corresponding patches of the edited image and the target image are mapped to language embeddings with CLIP model [Radford et al. 2021], and contrastive constraints are imposed on the embeddings, which avoids the blur issue caused by direct pixel supervision. To accelerate the execution, we adopt two-stage training strategy. At first, the framework is warmed-up on realism appearances by input single-view video. Then, we fine-tune the framework by the edited images from T2I module. The fine-tuning phrase usually takes five minutes. Benefit from the high inference speed of 3DGS, our pipeline could be easily accelerated to 48 FPS on single GPU machine and 15-18 FPS on mobile machine (e.g. Apple MacBook M1 chip). Overall, our main contributions are as follows: (1) To the best of our knowledge, we present the first method for text-driven head avatar editing from monocular video. It leverages the state-of-the-art in 3D Gaussian Splatting and Text-to-Image (T2I) model to achieve high-quality editing of dynamic avatar. (2) We propose conditional Tri-plane based Gaussian deformation field, which employs the canonical embedding to handle the nonlinear facial motion issue for toonification characters and significantly improve the animation accuracy. (3) We design real-time system capable of achieving inference speeds of over 48 FPS and pipeline about 25 FPS, with the 3DMM tracking algorithm being the efficiency bottleneck. Additionally, it is able to complete stylistic fine-tuning of special prompt in minutes."

It directly represents the density and color in NeRF through the stored three-plane features, which avoids the heavy rely on implicit features in connected MLP layers. Inspired by the color and density decoded by Tri-plane, we propose the conditional Tri-plane Gaussian Deformation Field to decode the Gaussian properties. Considering that our setting is person-specific neural rendering, the inputs are conditional embeddings instead of sampled noise. As shown in Figure 2, it takes the normalized orthographic rendering maps ðð¡ and expression ð½ð¡ as input with vertex position Sð¡ as prior to obtain the three plane features Fðð ð = {Fðð , Fð ð , Fð ð }.

            "content": "3.3.1 Non-rigid Motion Decoupling. In the 3DGS for dynamic scene, the rigid transformation matrix (R and T) is applied to the point clouds from the canonical to the observation space. To avoid the artifacts from the non-rigid motion of the shoulder, SplattingAvatar [Shao et al. 2024] and FlashAvatar [Xiang et al. 2023] remove the shoulder and only retain the face region (with neck). AD-NeRF [Guo et al. 2021] leverages the pre-trained segmentation model to parse the face and train two NeRFs to represent different areas, which heavily relies on the accuracy of the segmentation model. To address this problem, our approach arises from two assumptions: I) The head and shoulder within the same structure, which cannot be modeled independently. II) The shoulder is not completely fixed but exhibits the lazy\" movement with much lower amplitude and frequency than head motion. For assumption I), we initialize the shoulder from cuboid structure point clouds, and optimize its properties in Gaussian splatting together with the face part. In assumption II), we introduce learnable lazy\" factor ð¤ Rð 4 to control the shoulder movements. Specifically, the following rigid transformation is: ð¥ð¦ð§ + ð¥ð¦ð§, Rð ð ð, the {ð¥ð¦ð§, ð} is the position and quaternion vector in observation space, Rð is the quaternion corresponding to R.

As shown in Figure 3, the lazy factor ð¤ is broadcast to each point in the 3D Gaussian to achieve non-rigid coupling of the head and shoulder parts with soft boundary. 3.3.2 Pre-training Objectives. We warm-up the Tri-plane Gaussian deformation field and image-to-image (I2I) module on the realism appearance. The objective function is divided into three parts, coarse loss, refine-grained loss, and regularization of ð¤. The coarse loss Lððºðµ is euclidean distance supervision on pixel color of generated images (ð¼ð and ð¼ ) and ground-truth (ð¼ðð¡ ): Lððºðµ = ð¼ð ð¼ðð¡ 1 + ð¼ ð¼ðð¡ 1. (9) The refine-grained loss Lð¿ðð¼ ðð is defined by the LPIPS [Johnson et al. 2016] between output images (ð¼ ) from I2I module and groundtruth: Lð¿ðð¼ ðð = LPIPS(ð¼, ð¼ðð¡ ).

To achieve high-quality toonify editing and address inconsistency issues by T2I, the objective function focuses on feature distance rather than pixel distance. Inspired by NeRF-Art [Wang et al. 2023a], we employ patchaware contrastive loss. Specifically, we randomly select three patches of size 224 224 from the edited image and encode each patch into the language feature space using the CLIP model [Radford et al. 2021]. In each iteration, positive samples for contrastive learning are constructed from the edited image patches ð (Pð ), where ð is the pre-trained CLIP model for textural feature embedding and ð is patch from the edited images. Negative samples are built from predefined negative prompts ð (neg), where neg is randomly selected from set of negative prompts such as {Animal, Low quality, Blurry, Low res, Long neck, ...etc\"}.

Therefore, we select several related works for comparison, as, VToonify [Yang et al. 2022]: It is StyleGAN-based for precollection and annotation style images transfer to unaligned faces. We take the in-the-wild portrait movement to generate the corresponding toonified images. StyleGANEX [Yang et al. 2023a]: The StyleGANEX is also based on unalignment StyleGAN, which brings more flicker suppression and improved video consistency than VToonify. FRESCO [Yang et al. 2024]: The setting is similar to StyleGANEX and VToonify. But the difference is that it does not need to the pre-collection style images but adopts prompts and stable diffusion to edit the video style with optical flows. 5 SA Conference Papers 24, December 36, 2024, Tokyo, Japan Luchuan Song, Lele Chen, Celong Liu, Pinxi Liu, and Chenliang Xu Fig. 5.

At here, we take two criteria for numerical evaluations, one is from quantitative measurement, the other is from human assessment. 4.3.1 Quantitative Metrics. It is based on three aspects. (1) Blind / Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE): The BRISQUE [Mittal et al. 2011] is non-reference image quality assessment method, and is used to directly assess the quality of edited images. (2) Text-Image Consistency (CLIP-D) [Haque et al. 2023]: The CLIP-D is the embedding between text and image to calculate cosine similarity for each pair via CLIP. higher CLIP-D score indicates closer match between the generated appearance and the text. (3) Standard Deviation for video stylization (STD): We measure the CLIP features standard deviation of each frames across the video, which represents the stability of style in the video. (4) Frame Per Second without 3DMM Tracking (FPS w/o Track): We evaluate model inference speed on single NVIDIA RTX4090 GPU. Table 1. (1) Left: Quantitative evaluations with the baseline methods. The / indicates lower/higher values of better performance. The best results are in bold, and the second-best are underlined. (2) Right: The 5-point Likert scale for user study (closer to 5 indicates better performance). 4.3.2 User Study. We sample 10 different identities each one with 8 styles (80 videos for self-reenactment and 50 videos for crossreenactment), and invite 32 attendees from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to join the study. The Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) rating protocol is adopted for evaluation and the attendees are required to rate the generated videos from four aspects: (1) IP (Identity Preservation): Do you agree the identity is well-preserved in the stylized video? , (2) TP (Text Preservation): Do you agree the text description is well-presented in the stylized video?, (3) MS (Motion Synchronization): Do you agree the head motion in stylized video is synchronized with source one? and (4) VQ (Video Quality): Do you agree the overall video quality is good, e.g. frame quality, temporal consistency etc? There is 5-point Likert scale for each term, range from 1-5 corresponds to strongly disagree, disagree, dont know, agree and strongly agree respectively (the closer to 5 the better)."

We enumerated the fine-tuned results under the pre-trained models under different epochs (the fine-tuning steps are set 500 iterations). As shown in Figure 6, larger pre-train epoch corresponds to more detailed realistic appearance (mean error 2.74 for epoch 30), and the fine-tuned stylization appearance also has more details. It can Fig. 7. The visualization of three ablation studies (from top to bottom) results from multi-view, the multi-view results are only learned from monocular inputs.

(CC BY), and Wojciech Zielonka et al. (CC BY). be concluded that fine-tuning will not contribute additional finegrained gains to the appearance, and an excellent pre-trained model is fundamental for effective stylization. 4.5.2 Adaptation to prompts. In the previous mention, the format of the used prompt is similar to \"Turn ... into ...\". To demonstrate robustness to prompts, we show the results by simple prompts, such as \"Kawaii\", as shown in the Figure 7 (first row). We present each style from multiple view, which are learned from single-view input. Moreover, our method is adaptable to different prompts and can even handle mixed styles like \"Kid + Marble\". Stylization intensity. The control over stylization intensity 4.5.3 is shown in the second row in Figure 7. We take the ratio of the text control strength and the image guidance strength in the T2I (the larger the ratio, the data provided by T2I is closer to the text description style) as the stylization intensity. The intensity is 0 representing the facial appearance without stylization. We find that as intensity increases, the appearance is closer to textually descriptive (e.g., the face color becomes whiter) while maintaining the same expressions as the pre-trained one. 7 SA Conference Papers 24, December 36, 2024, Tokyo, Japan Luchuan Song, Lele Chen, Celong Liu, Pinxi Liu, and Chenliang Xu Fig. 8. We visualize the conditional Tri-plane Gaussian deformation field Dð using cross-identity driven approach.

Generally, the fine-tuning time is set to 5 minutes. 4.5.5 Ablation study on Dð . The conditional Tri-plane Gaussian deformation field is used throughout the pre-training and fine-tuning phase. Its main role is to reduce reliance on large number of MLPs and control facial expressions with conditional inputs. We replace Dð with the connected MLP layers and repeat the pipeline. As shown in Figure 8, w/o Dð is to replace Dð by MLPs. It can be observed that the introduction of Dð improves the accuracy of expression for pre-trained realism appearance.

Additionally, we present quantitative measurements to verify this perceptual assessment. Specifically, we leverage the average ð¿1 distance on facial key points to evaluate the results corresponding to w/ and w/o Dð on the pre-trained appearance. Since keypoints cannot be accurately detected on stylized faces, we exclude the fine-tuned appearance from this discussion. Please refer to [Duan et al. 2023] for key point distance details. The keypoint distance for w/ and w/o Dð are 4.87 and 5.90 respectively, indicating that Dð leads to more accurate facial movements. 4.5.6 Ablation study on Lð¶ðð . The Lð¶ðð is used to improve the quality of stylized images through patch-aware contrastive learning during fine-tuning, preventing over-smoothing. We show the fine-tuned appearance with (w/) and without (w/o) it in Figure 9. The results without Lð¶ðð are smoother and lack the facial details. Additionally, we provide quantitative evaluations: the BRISQUE score with Lð¶ðð is 52.5, while the score is 67.1 for w/o. 4.5.7 Ablation study on factor ð¤. We introduce the \"lazy\" factor ð¤ in Section 3.3. The primary assumption behind ð¤ is to eliminate the need for separate processing of the shoulder (also referred to as the torso) and the head, as was required in previous works such as ADNeRF [Guo et al. 2021]. This adaptive parsing method significantly enhances the robustness of rigid upper-body movement modeling. As illustrated in Figure 10, we employ different configurations of ð¤ to achieve the transition of rigid movement from canonical space to camera space.

(CC BY). in Eq. 7 and estimated head rotation matrix for ð¤1, the head and shoulder motion are hard parsed. (b): The head and shoulders share the same estimated rotation matrix. (c): ð¤ is adaptively learned. When ð¤ is hard-parsed, the head and shoulder movements are uncoordinated, leading to separation as seen in Figure 10(a). Conversely, in Figure 10(b), the shoulders move in sync with the head, which is not accurate, as the shoulders typically remain still or exhibit only minimal movement. Our method is able to improve stabilize shoulder motion. While shoulder movement can be managed using other techniques, such as Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) around the neck, our approach is specifically designed for the real-time head tracking, as detailed in Section 3.1. It is trade-off between real-time capable and render quality."
