            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "Generating high-quality toonified avatar videos is long-studied topic in computer vision and computer graphics, with applications in daily life, social media, movies, and video game character creation. Recently, generative models have shown great promise in creating stylized portrait videos. For instance, VToonify [Yang et al. 2022] uses learnable StyleGAN [Karras et al. 2020, 2019] to translate the specific portrait videos into different style via pre-collection images. AvatarStudio [Pan et al. 2023] edits dynamic facial appearances by score distillation sampling [Shi et al. 2023] from multi-view camera views. However, existing methods face challenges such as re-animation issues, low quality, and inference inefficiency, limiting their use in consumer applications. An ideal toonification avatar generation system should meet the following principles: Text Toonification: Text is widely used for providing instructions in everyday activities, requiring minimal expert knowledge. Consequently, user-friendly system can generate the corresponding appearance based on user-input instructions, without pre-collection data or annotations. Generalizability to the Driven Signal: The toonified avatar generated should have the capability to be controlled by arbitrary identites with varying head motions and expressions. Rapid Adaptation and Real-time Animation: The model should swiftly adjust to the desired style following user-input instructions within few minutes. Once adapted, real-time animation should be achievable on consumer devices. To achieve the above principles, we propose an effective method named TextToon for head avatar toonification. Inspired by Triplane based neural volumetric representation, we use normalized orthographic rendering as the conditional Tri-plane inputs for 3D Gaussian points properties. The 3D Gaussian points, which control dynamic head expressions in the canonical space, are influenced not only by the linear deformations from 3DMM coefficients but also by the learnable Tri-plane features. However, since 3DMM is linear model with limited facial expression capacity, we utilize the Tri-plane neural network structure to adaptively learn the mapping between the condition rendering and the corresponding stylized appearance in canonical space. Specifically, the normalized orthographic rendering map and 3DMM mesh deformed by expression 2 provide coarse representation of Gaussian point clouds. The finegrained topology structure results from further displacement of the coarse points positions by the learned Tri-plane features. For head motion, the estimated rotation and translation matrix are multiplied by each Gaussian points property to achieve full movement. Although the conditional Tri-plane-based 3D Gaussian Splatting significantly improves the accuracy of stylized facial expression representation, the toonification approaches still suffers from poor visual quality. For example, the inconsistencies in the diffusion-based Text-to-Image (T2I) editor [Aneja et al. 2023; Müller et al. 2022; Shen et al. 2024; Wu et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2023b] result in unclear and over-smoothed rendering outcomes [Shao et al. 2023]. To address this issue, we employ patch-aware contrastive learning manner in the fine-tuning phrase. Specifically, the corresponding patches of the edited image and the target image are mapped to language embeddings with CLIP model [Radford et al. 2021], and contrastive constraints are imposed on the embeddings, which avoids the blur issue caused by direct pixel supervision. To accelerate the execution, we adopt two-stage training strategy. At first, the framework is warmed-up on realism appearances by input single-view video. Then, we fine-tune the framework by the edited images from T2I module. The fine-tuning phrase usually takes five minutes. Benefit from the high inference speed of 3DGS, our pipeline could be easily accelerated to 48 FPS on single GPU machine and 15-18 FPS on mobile machine (e.g. Apple MacBook M1 chip). Overall, our main contributions are as follows: (1) To the best of our knowledge, we present the first method for text-driven head avatar editing from monocular video. It leverages the state-of-the-art in 3D Gaussian Splatting and Text-to-Image (T2I) model to achieve high-quality editing of dynamic avatar. (2) We propose conditional Tri-plane based Gaussian deformation field, which employs the canonical embedding to handle the nonlinear facial motion issue for toonification characters and significantly improve the animation accuracy. (3) We design real-time system capable of achieving inference speeds of over 48 FPS and pipeline about 25 FPS, with the 3DMM tracking algorithm being the efficiency bottleneck. Additionally, it is able to complete stylistic fine-tuning of special prompt in minutes."

            "content": "The Tri-plane [Chan et al. 2022; Shao et al. 2023; Song et al. 2024; Sun et al. 2022] has made significant improvement in 3D representation. It directly represents the density and color in NeRF through the stored three-plane features, which avoids the heavy rely on implicit features in connected MLP layers. Inspired by the color and density decoded by Tri-plane, we propose the conditional Tri-plane Gaussian Deformation Field to decode the Gaussian properties. Considering that our setting is person-specific neural rendering, the inputs are conditional embeddings instead of sampled noise. As shown in Figure 2, it takes the normalized orthographic rendering maps 𝑚𝑡 and expression 𝛽𝑡 as input with vertex position S𝑡 as prior to obtain the three plane features F𝑋𝑌 𝑍 = {F𝑋𝑌 , F𝑋 𝑍 , F𝑌 𝑍 }. We build Gaussian deformation decoder for the properties in 3DGS. Specifically, the points in Gaussian field can be represented by the offset on position vector 𝑥𝑦𝑧 R𝑁 3, quaternion vector 𝑞 R𝑁 4 and scaling vector 𝑠 R𝑁 3 (please note the scale 𝑠 is distinguished from geometry S), where the 𝑁 is the number of Gaussian points. Apart from that, each point has additional parameters: spherical harmonics (SH) 𝑠ℎ R𝑁 3 and opacity 𝛾 R𝑁 1. The head canonical appearance Gaussian deformation field D𝐶 can be formulated as: {𝑥𝑦𝑧, 𝑞, 𝑠, 𝑠ℎ, 𝛾 } = D𝐶 (𝑚𝑡 , 𝛽𝑡 , S𝑡 ). (4) Considering that the expression motion of toonified face and the realism face are different, it is hard to directly fine-tune {𝑥𝑦𝑧, 𝑞, 𝑠} to achieve the toonified expression control. Therefore, we do not completely adopt the learned 𝑥𝑦𝑧 as the fine-grained face motion as previous methods [Qian et al. 2023; Xiang et al. 2023; Xu et al. 2024]. The vertex from coarse facial geometry is set as prior Gaussian points for each frame. Specifically, we sample the vertices coordinate Fig. 3. visualization of the adaptively selected points via 𝑤.

            "content": "3.3.1 Non-rigid Motion Decoupling. In the 3DGS for dynamic scene, the rigid transformation matrix (R and T) is applied to the point clouds from the canonical to the observation space. To avoid the artifacts from the non-rigid motion of the shoulder, SplattingAvatar [Shao et al. 2024] and FlashAvatar [Xiang et al. 2023] remove the shoulder and only retain the face region (with neck). AD-NeRF [Guo et al. 2021] leverages the pre-trained segmentation model to parse the face and train two NeRFs to represent different areas, which heavily relies on the accuracy of the segmentation model. To address this problem, our approach arises from two assumptions: I) The head and shoulder within the same structure, which cannot be modeled independently. II) The shoulder is not completely fixed but exhibits the lazy\" movement with much lower amplitude and frequency than head motion. For assumption I), we initialize the shoulder from cuboid structure point clouds, and optimize its properties in Gaussian splatting together with the face part. In assumption II), we introduce learnable lazy\" factor 𝑤 R𝑁 4 to control the shoulder movements. Specifically, the following rigid transformation is: 𝑥𝑦𝑧 + 𝑥𝑦𝑧, R𝑞 𝑞 𝑞, the {𝑥𝑦𝑧, 𝑞} is the position and quaternion vector in observation space, R𝑞 is the quaternion corresponding to R. Then, we apply the lazy vector 𝑤 for non-rigid adjustments to Eq. 5: (5) 𝑥𝑦𝑧 𝑤 + 𝑥𝑦𝑧, R𝑞 𝑞 𝑤 𝑞. (6) 𝑥𝑦𝑧1 𝑤1 + 𝑥𝑦𝑧2 𝑤2 + 𝑥𝑦𝑧 The Eq. 6 can be divided into head and shoulder parts: 1 + 𝑥𝑦𝑧 2 1 + 𝑞 R𝑞 𝑞1 𝑤1 + R𝑞 𝑞2 𝑤2 𝑞 , 2 𝑥𝑦𝑧1, 𝑥𝑦𝑧 , 𝑤1 are for face region and 𝑥𝑦𝑧2, 𝑥𝑦𝑧 , 𝑤2 are 1 2 for shoulder region, 𝑤 is the concatenation of 𝑤1 and 𝑤2. Then, the head moves rigidly and the shoulder moves lazily, so we have: , 𝑞2, 𝑞 2 , 𝑞1, 𝑞 1 (7) , 𝑤1 I𝑞, 𝑤2 (R1)𝑞 . (8) 4 TextToon: Real-Time Text Toonify Head Avatar from Single Video SA Conference Papers 24, December 36, 2024, Tokyo, Japan The 𝑤 is learned according to the approximation in Eq. 8, and I𝑞 is the quaternion corresponding to the unit rotation matrix. As shown in Figure 3, the lazy factor 𝑤 is broadcast to each point in the 3D Gaussian to achieve non-rigid coupling of the head and shoulder parts with soft boundary. 3.3.2 Pre-training Objectives. We warm-up the Tri-plane Gaussian deformation field and image-to-image (I2I) module on the realism appearance. The objective function is divided into three parts, coarse loss, refine-grained loss, and regularization of 𝑤. The coarse loss L𝑅𝐺𝐵 is euclidean distance supervision on pixel color of generated images (𝐼𝑟 and 𝐼 ) and ground-truth (𝐼𝑔𝑡 ): L𝑅𝐺𝐵 = 𝐼𝑟 𝐼𝑔𝑡 1 + 𝐼 𝐼𝑔𝑡 1. (9) The refine-grained loss L𝐿𝑃𝐼 𝑃𝑆 is defined by the LPIPS [Johnson et al. 2016] between output images (𝐼 ) from I2I module and groundtruth: L𝐿𝑃𝐼 𝑃𝑆 = LPIPS(𝐼, 𝐼𝑔𝑡 ). At last, the regularization of 𝑤 is: 𝑤 𝑤𝑇 𝑐 I𝑞 2, (10) (11) where 𝑤𝑐 R𝑁 4 is vector and equal to [I𝑞, R𝑞], where 𝑤 = [𝑤1, 𝑤2] is set by the face and shoulder point cloud. The total objective function is: L𝑅𝐺𝐵 + L𝐿𝑃𝐼 𝑃𝑆 + 𝜆 𝑤 𝑤𝑇 𝑐 I𝑞 2, (12) the 𝜆 is hyperparameter and it is equal to 1𝑒 3 in our work."

            "content": "Text-driven appearance is fine-tuned with the images edited by T2I model [Brooks et al. 2023] instead of the realistic appearance from video frames, as shown in Figure 2 IV). To achieve high-quality toonify editing and address inconsistency issues by T2I, the objective function focuses on feature distance rather than pixel distance. Inspired by NeRF-Art [Wang et al. 2023a], we employ patchaware contrastive loss. Specifically, we randomly select three patches of size 224 224 from the edited image and encode each patch into the language feature space using the CLIP model [Radford et al. 2021]. In each iteration, positive samples for contrastive learning are constructed from the edited image patches 𝜋 (P𝑗 ), where 𝜋 is the pre-trained CLIP model for textural feature embedding and 𝑗 is patch from the edited images. Negative samples are built from predefined negative prompts 𝜋 (neg), where neg is randomly selected from set of negative prompts such as {Animal, Low quality, Blurry, Low res, Long neck, ...etc\"}. During optimization, we aim to shorten the distance between 𝑗 and the positive samples while pushing them away from the negative descriptions. The patch-aware contrastive learning objective function is: L𝐶𝑂𝑁 = log[ PI exp(𝜋 (P 𝑗 ) 𝜋 (P𝑗 )) exp(𝜋 (P 𝑗 ) 𝜋 (P𝑗 )) + exp(𝜋 (P𝑗 ) 𝜋 (neg)) ], (13) where the P𝑗 is the corresponding rendered image patches from Gaussian splatting. From Eq. 13, we avoid measuring the pixel distances and refer to text feature distances. Taking over the objective functions in Sec. 3.3, the objective functions for fine-tuning are: L𝐿𝑃𝐼 𝑃𝑆 + 𝜆1 L𝐶𝑂𝑁 + 𝜆2 𝑤 𝑤𝑇 𝑐 I𝑞 2, (14) where the 𝜆1 and 𝜆2 are set to 1𝑒 3 in our work. The overall objects remain similar to Eq. 12, the difference is that we apply L𝐶𝑂𝑁 instead of L𝑅𝐺𝐵.

The Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) rating protocol is adopted for evaluation and the attendees are required to rate the generated videos from four aspects: (1) IP (Identity Preservation): Do you agree the identity is well-preserved in the stylized video? , (2) TP (Text Preservation): Do you agree the text description is well-presented in the stylized video?, (3) MS (Motion Synchronization): Do you agree the head motion in stylized video is synchronized with source one? and (4) VQ (Video Quality): Do you agree the overall video quality is good, e.g. frame quality, temporal consistency etc? There is 5-point Likert scale for each term, range from 1-5 corresponds to strongly disagree, disagree, dont know, agree and strongly agree respectively (the closer to 5 the better)."

            "content": "We focus on the following aspects for ablation studies. 4.5.1 Relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning. We enumerated the fine-tuned results under the pre-trained models under different epochs (the fine-tuning steps are set 500 iterations). As shown in Figure 6, larger pre-train epoch corresponds to more detailed realistic appearance (mean error 2.74 for epoch 30), and the fine-tuned stylization appearance also has more details. It can Fig. 7. The visualization of three ablation studies (from top to bottom) results from multi-view, the multi-view results are only learned from monocular inputs.

(CC BY), and Wojciech Zielonka et al. (CC BY). be concluded that fine-tuning will not contribute additional finegrained gains to the appearance, and an excellent pre-trained model is fundamental for effective stylization. 4.5.2 Adaptation to prompts. In the previous mention, the format of the used prompt is similar to \"Turn ... into ...\". To demonstrate robustness to prompts, we show the results by simple prompts, such as \"Kawaii\", as shown in the Figure 7 (first row). We present each style from multiple view, which are learned from single-view input. Moreover, our method is adaptable to different prompts and can even handle mixed styles like \"Kid + Marble\". Stylization intensity. The control over stylization intensity 4.5.3 is shown in the second row in Figure 7. We take the ratio of the text control strength and the image guidance strength in the T2I (the larger the ratio, the data provided by T2I is closer to the text description style) as the stylization intensity. The intensity is 0 representing the facial appearance without stylization. We find that as intensity increases, the appearance is closer to textually descriptive (e.g., the face color becomes whiter) while maintaining the same expressions as the pre-trained one. 7 SA Conference Papers 24, December 36, 2024, Tokyo, Japan Luchuan Song, Lele Chen, Celong Liu, Pinxi Liu, and Chenliang Xu Fig. 8. We visualize the conditional Tri-plane Gaussian deformation field D𝑐 using cross-identity driven approach. Utilizing D𝑐 (w/) helps manage more complex mouth shapes compared to not using D𝑐 (w/o).

We initialize from the pre-trained model (Time = 0 min). After more than 2 minutes, the change in appearance is minor. Generally, the fine-tuning time is set to 5 minutes. 4.5.5 Ablation study on D𝑐 . The conditional Tri-plane Gaussian deformation field is used throughout the pre-training and fine-tuning phase. Its main role is to reduce reliance on large number of MLPs and control facial expressions with conditional inputs. We replace D𝑐 with the connected MLP layers and repeat the pipeline. As shown in Figure 8, w/o D𝑐 is to replace D𝑐 by MLPs. It can be observed that the introduction of D𝑐 improves the accuracy of expression for pre-trained realism appearance. This enhancement also positively 8 Fig. 10. The visualize of the ablation study on 𝑤.

We zoom-in the neck-shoulder transition area to highlight the details. There are artifacts around the neck in (a) due to inconsistent head/shoulder movement, and the shoulder in (b) is displaced synchronously with the head. The influence occurs throughout both the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. Natural faceYufeng Zheng et al. (CC BY). affects the stylized appearance. Additionally, we present quantitative measurements to verify this perceptual assessment. Specifically, we leverage the average 𝐿1 distance on facial key points to evaluate the results corresponding to w/ and w/o D𝑐 on the pre-trained appearance. Since keypoints cannot be accurately detected on stylized faces, we exclude the fine-tuned appearance from this discussion. Please refer to [Duan et al. 2023] for key point distance details. The keypoint distance for w/ and w/o D𝑐 are 4.87 and 5.90 respectively, indicating that D𝑐 leads to more accurate facial movements. 4.5.6 Ablation study on L𝐶𝑂𝑁 . The L𝐶𝑂𝑁 is used to improve the quality of stylized images through patch-aware contrastive learning during fine-tuning, preventing over-smoothing. We show the fine-tuned appearance with (w/) and without (w/o) it in Figure 9. The results without L𝐶𝑂𝑁 are smoother and lack the facial details. Additionally, we provide quantitative evaluations: the BRISQUE score with L𝐶𝑂𝑁 is 52.5, while the score is 67.1 for w/o. 4.5.7 Ablation study on factor 𝑤. We introduce the \"lazy\" factor 𝑤 in Section 3.3. The primary assumption behind 𝑤 is to eliminate the need for separate processing of the shoulder (also referred to as the torso) and the head, as was required in previous works such as ADNeRF [Guo et al. 2021]. This adaptive parsing method significantly enhances the robustness of rigid upper-body movement modeling. As illustrated in Figure 10, we employ different configurations of 𝑤 to achieve the transition of rigid movement from canonical space to camera space. (a): fixed unit rotation matrix 𝐼 is assigned to 𝑤 TextToon: Real-Time Text Toonify Head Avatar from Single Video SA Conference Papers 24, December 36, 2024, Tokyo, Japan Fig. 11. The visualize of comparison with Next3D, the PTI (StyleGAN inversion) is used for feature embedding. We find that the results suffer from facial identity drift. Furthermore, the two styles associated with Next3D (Pixar and Cartoon) are not distinct. We apply the prompts Cartoon\" and Pixar\" for Next3D, the corresponding prompts for our method are Turn him into cartoon style\" and Turn him into Pixar style\". Natural faceLizhen Wang et al. (CC BY). in Eq. 7 and estimated head rotation matrix for 𝑤1, the head and shoulder motion are hard parsed. (b): The head and shoulders share the same estimated rotation matrix. (c): 𝑤 is adaptively learned. When 𝑤 is hard-parsed, the head and shoulder movements are uncoordinated, leading to separation as seen in Figure 10(a). Conversely, in Figure 10(b), the shoulders move in sync with the head, which is not accurate, as the shoulders typically remain still or exhibit only minimal movement. Our method is able to improve stabilize shoulder motion. While shoulder movement can be managed using other techniques, such as Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) around the neck, our approach is specifically designed for the real-time head tracking, as detailed in Section 3.1. It is trade-off between real-time capable and render quality."

But they requires extra facial alignment and depend on StyleGAN [Karras et al. 2019] inversion for specific identities. And DeformToon3D is built based on StyleSDF [Or-El et al. 2022]. The StyleSDF [Or-El et al. 2022] does not have the inversion approach so far. In addition, we provide some comparison results with Next3D by PTI [Roich et al. 2021] inversion in Figure 11.
