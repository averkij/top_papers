As result, post-training LLM for reasoning has garnered surge of interest in both industry and research[OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Muennighoff et al., 2025]. Despite growing research, existing surveys [Plaat et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024] often conflate logical reasoning with general-purpose heuristic strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [Xia et al., 2024]. There has been lack of literature review dedicated to LLM and formal symbolic logic. This survey provides comprehensive review of logical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), with focus on formal and symbolic logic-based reasoning rather than general heuristic approaches. We begin by defining logical reasoning in AI, distinguishing it from generalpurpose reasoning, and categorizing key paradigms, including deductive, inductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning. Additionally, we analyze existing benchmarks and evaluation methodologies, identifying gaps in assessing symbolic inference, consistency, and robustness. We further explore state-of-the-art techniques for enhancing logical reasoning, such as instruction fine-tuning, logic-informed pre-training, reinforcement learning, inference-time decoding strategies, and hybrid neuro-symbolic methods. We examine recent advances in neuro-symbolic integration, along with applications of theorem provers, logic solvers, and formal verification frameworks in LLMs. Finally, we highlight open challenges in scalability, reasoning consistency, explainability, and efficiency, proposing future directions for multi-modal reasoning, hybrid architectures, and improved evaluation frameworks.

By the mid-century, AI pioneers like John McCarthy leveraged logic for knowledge representation and automated theorem proving, leading to logic programming and knowledge bases. The 1970s introduced non-monotonic logic, enabling AI to handle commonsense reasoning. The 1980s saw logical reasoning integrate with knowledge representation, advancing expert systems for real-world applications. The 1990s saw the rise of knowledge graphs, structuring vast knowledge for complex reasoning tasks. In the 21st century, neuro-symbolic approaches have merged deep learning with logical inference, resulting in tools like DeepLogic [Cingillioglu and Russo, 2019] and SATNet [Wang et al., 2019]. Logical reasoning remains cornerstone of AI research, evolving from philosophy to modern computing. As AI advances, logical reasoning continues to shape intelligent systems, ensuring structured, interpretable, and robust decision-making."

            "content": "Deductive Reasoning. This type of reasoning derives specific conclusions from general principles or premises. It operates under the rule that if all premises are true and the reasoning is valid, the conclusion must also be true. For example, given the premises All apples are red and This fruit is an apple one can deduce that This fruit is red Deductive reasoning is fundamental in fields such as mathematics and formal logic, where certainty and rigor are paramount. Inductive Reasoning. Unlike deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning draws general conclusions based on specific observations or evidence. While the conclusions are often considered probable, they are not guaranteed to be true. For instance, observing that all swans seen so far are white might lead to the inductive conclusion that All swans are white Inductive reasoning is widely used in scientific discovery and data-driven decision-making, where patterns and trends are inferred from empirical data. Abductive Reasoning. This form of reasoning seeks the most plausible explanation or cause for set of observations, often in the presence of incomplete information. Abductive reasoning is particularly useful in diagnostic tasks and realworld problem-solving. For example, seeing wet spots on the street might lead one to infer that It has recently rained While abductive conclusions are not certain, they provide practical basis for hypothesis generation and decision-making under uncertainty. Analogical Reasoning. Analogical reasoning involves drawing comparisons between similar situations or domains to make inferences or solve problems. By identifying parallels between different scenarios, this type of reasoning enables creative problem-solving and knowledge transfer. For example, understanding that planets orbit the sun in elliptical paths might lead one to analogically reason that other celestial bodies, such as comets, exhibit similar orbital characterDataset LogiQA ReClor AR-LSAT CLUTRR GSM LINGOLY ConTRoL FOLIO LogicNLI ProofWriter LogicBench GLoRE LogiGLUE LogiTorch BIG-Bench Language Zh/En En En En En En En En En En En Zh/En En En En Question Type Multichoice Multichoice Multichoice Question-answering Math word problems Question-answering ternary classification binary classification ternary classification binary classification binary classification Miscellaneous Miscellaneous Miscellaneous Miscellaneous Source Exam-based Exam-based Exam-based Rule-based Exam-based Expert-designed Exam-based Expert-designed Exam-based Exam-based Rule-based Size 15,937 6,138 2,064 6,016 19K 1,133 8,325 1,351 30K - 1,270 17 tasks Miscellaneous 24 tasks Miscellaneous 16 tasks Miscellaneous Miscellaneous 7 tasks Table 1: Main Datasets and Benchmarks of Logical Reasoning Task. istics.

            "content": "D = arg max R(MD) (1) where: D: training datasets. MD: model trained on D. R: performance evaluator (e.g., LLM-as-a-judge, rulebased metrics). This formulation highlights the central role of dataset optimization in data-centric approaches. In practice, datacentric methods typically involve three types of datasets: expert-curated datasets, synthetic datasets, and LLM-distilled datasets. Expert-Curated Datasets. The FOLIO series [Han et al., 2024a; Han et al., 2024b] establish formal verification through FOL annotations, with P-FOLIO extending the complexity of reasoning chains for enhanced training. LeanDojo [Yang et al., 2023] provides 98k+ human-proven theorem pairs for mathematical reasoning. Additionally, SymbolLLM [Xu et al., 2024a] systematically organizes 34 symbolic reasoning tasks to capture inter-symbol relationships across 20 distinct symbolic families. Synthetic Datasets. Rule-based synthetic data remains fundamental for data generation. RuleTaker [Clark et al., 2021] formalizes this through three-phase pipeline: behavior formalization, example synthesis and linguistic equivalents generation. Similarly, Morishita et al. [2024] develops Formal Logic Deduction Diverse (FLD2), synthetic dataset based on symbolic theory and previous empirical insights. LLM-Distilled Datasets. Researchers employ advanced models such as GPT-4 for intermediate reasoning step distillation. LogiCoT [Liu et al., 2023c] augments existing datasets with GPT4-generated reasoning chains, while LogicPro [Jiang et al., 2024] combines algorithmic problems with code solutions to create variable-guided reasoning data. To advance, Wang et al. [2024b] propose PODA, which generates contrastive analyses of correct/incorrect options through premise-oriented augmentation, enabling reasoning path differentiation via contrastive learning. (Î¸, S) = arg max Î¸,S R(MÎ¸, S) (2) where: Î¸: learnable model parameters. MÎ¸: model with parameters Î¸. S: decoding strategy (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting, verification-based decoding). R: reasoning performance metric. This formulation highlights the joint optimization of model parameters Î¸ and decoding strategy S. Practical implementations can be categorized as: Instruction Fine-Tuning: optimizing Î¸. Reinforcement Learning: optimizing Î¸. Inference-Time Decoding: optimizing S. Model-Centric approaches focus on directly improving the models reasoning capabilities by optimizing its internal mechanisms and decoding strategies, making them complementary to data-centric approaches. Instruction Fine-Tuning Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) adapts LLMs through supervised learning on task-specific instructions. For example, Liu et al. [2023c] design multi-grained instructions spanning diverse levels of abstraction and complexity. Similarly, Feng et al. [2024] IFT models to mimic logical solvers by replicating formal deduction reasoning processes. In addition, Xu et al. [2024a] implement two-stage symbolic fine-tuning through Injection (injecting symbolic knowledge) and Infusion (balancing symbol and NL reasoning). To overcome IFTs over-fitting limitations, Wang et [2024b] enforce contrastive learning between facal. tual/counterfactual paths with IFT. Further, Wang et al. [2024a] augment Llamas with Program-Guided Learning Framework and logic-specific architecture adjustments. Recently, Muennighoff et al. [2025] propose s1, achieving test-time scaling through IFT on 1,000 meticulously crafted long CoT samples. Combined with budget-forcing technique, it significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model, allowing extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning (RL) has become pivotal in optimizing large language models (LLMs), particularly since the breakthrough of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Jiao et al. [2024] leverage RL for planningbased reasoning optimization, while Xi et al. [2024] develop R3, achieving process supervision benefits through outcomeonly supervision. The success of large-scale RL in OpenAI-o1 [OpenAI, 2024] has inspired numerous studies. RL algorithms train o1style models to enhance Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, addressing issues like formulaic outputs and limited longform reasoning. For instance, Zhao et al. [2024] integrate CoT instruction fine-tuning with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) decoding for multi-path reasoning exploration. In contrast, Zhang et al. [2024] employ MCTS to generate codereasoning data for instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)."

            "content": "from DeepSeekR1 [DeepSeek-AI, 2025], which pioneers novel RL strategy to enhance logical reasoning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, trained purely through RL without IFT, demonstrates impressive reasoning capabilities but faces challenges in readability and language consistency. To address this, DeepSeek-R1 introduces minimal long-CoT IFT data as cold start before RL, achieving balance between usability and reasoning performance. By iteratively synthesizing high-quality reasoning data through RL, DeepSeek-R1 overcomes limitations imposed by human annotators, addressing issues such as mechanistic responses, repetitive patterns, and insufficient long-chain reasoning. This approach represents potential paradigm shift in logical reasoning optimization, pushing the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve in structured reasoning tasks. Inference-Time Decoding We categorize logical reasoning enhancement methods during inference-time into inference-time scaling and constrained decoding. Inference-time scaling employs computational augmentation without parameter updates. One common approach is decoding with structured outputs and modular workflows. GoT [Lei et al., 2023] creates structured reasoning nodes to improve complex multi-step logical reasoning. Similarly, Chain of Logic [Servantez et al., 2024] introduces Decomposition-Recomposition structure for legal reasoning. In other contexts, researchers design more complex modular workflows for better performance [Creswell et al., 2023; Malon et al., 2024]. Another inference-time scaling approach involves stimulating autonomous reasoning, guiding LLMs to iteratively refine their answers. Maieutic Prompting [Jung et al., 2022] eliminates contradictions through recursive reasoning. Similarly, Logic-of-Thoughts [Liu et al., 2024a] and DetermLR [Sun et al., 2024] progressively approach the answers in an iterative style. Constrained decoding methods, on the other hand, focus on improving the controllability and reliability of reasoning processes. Neurologic [Lu et al., 2021] enforces predicate logic constraints, while Formal-LLM [Li et al., 2024b] integrates automata for constraining plan generation."

R: The reasoning performance metric, which evaluates the ability to perform logical reasoning tasks. The optimization process involves two key directions: Improving : including refining the models parameters and decoding strategies to produce symbolic representations that are both accurate and compatible with . Enhancing : involving improving the symbolic solvers ability to process. By jointly optimizing and , neural-symbolic hybrid systems aim to leverage the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning to achieve superior logical reasoning capabilities. It is worth noting that in earlier neural-symbolic pipelines, is often implemented as fixed external logical reasoning engine, and thus is generally not optimized. However, in advanced practice, LLMs are increasingly being used to perform the role of , enabling diverse optimization. Fundamentally, these methods involve translating problems into symbolic representations with LLMs, and external symbolic solvers solving them. in LINC [Olausson et al., 2023], LLMs convert natural language (NL) into first-order logic (FOL) expressions, and utilize an external theorem prover for symbolic deductive inference. For example, Further efforts focus on improving NL-to-symbolic translation. One prevailing approach is directly optimizing translation through training [Yang et al., 2024a] or decoding strategies [Ryu et al., 2024], while the other depends on verification or correction mechanisms [Yang et al., 2024a; Pan et al., 2023]. Building upon these, recent advancements address the traditional pipeline limitations by fully integrating LLMs into reasoning processes. Logic Agent (LA) [Liu et al., 2024a] replaces external solvers with rule-guided LLM inference chains, while LLM-TRes [Toroghi et al., 2024] implements self-contained verifiable reasoning without external symbolic solvers. SymbCoT [Xu et al., 2024c] coordinates translation, planning, solving and verification entirely through LLMs. Xu et al. [2024b] propose Aristotle, which further systematizes the symbolic reasoning pipeline through three LLM-driven components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver."

            "title": "6 Discussion\nThe integration of logical reasoning into large language mod-\nels (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, marked by persistent\ngaps between heuristic performance and formal logical rigor.\nBelow, we analyze three unresolved tensions dominating the\nfield and outline future directions.\nRobustness vs. Generalization. LLMs exhibit inconsis-\ntent performance in structured reasoning tasks such as deduc-\ntive inference and abductive hypothesis generation. While\nmodels fine-tuned on datasets like FOLIO [Han et al., 2024a]\nexcel in controlled settings, they struggle with adversarial\nperturbations or semantically equivalent rephrasings. This\ninconsistency arises from their reliance on surface-level sta-\ntistical correlations rather than causal relationships, coupled\nwith limited out-of-distribution generalization. A key ques-\ntion persists: can LLMs achieve human-like robustness with-\nout sacrificing cross-domain adaptability? Current methods\nprioritize narrow task performance, leaving real-world appli-\ncability uncertain.\nInterpretability vs. Performance. A central tension lies in\nbalancing neural scalability with symbolic precision. Neuro-\nsymbolic approaches like Logic-LM [Pan et al., 2023] and\nSymbol-LLM [Xu et al., 2024a] embed formal logic solvers\ninto neural architectures, improving interpretability through\nstep-by-step proofs. However, these methods face scalability",
            "content": "bottlenecks with large knowledge bases or complex rule dependencies. Conversely, data-driven methods (e.g., instruction tuning on LogicBench [Parmar et al., 2024]) achieve broader task coverage but fail to generalize beyond syntactic patterns. How can we reconcile transparent reasoning with black-box model performance? Hybrid architectures offer promise but introduce computational overhead, limiting practical deployment. Evaluation Rigor. Existing benchmarks like LogiQA [Liu et al., 2021b] and ReClor [Yu et al., 2020] conflate reasoning ability with pattern recognition through multiple-choice formats. While efforts like NeuLR [Xu et al., 2023] curate neutral content to isolate reasoning from domain knowledge, they lack scope for holistic evaluation. Current metrics (e.g., accuracy, BLEU) fail to assess consistency (invariance to logically equivalent inputs) or soundness (adherence to formal proof structures). What defines gold standard for logical reasoning evaluation? Benchmarks must prioritize systematic testing of core principles (e.g., transitivity, contraposition) over task-specific performance. Future Directions. Addressing these challenges requires hybrid architectures that dynamically integrate neural and symbolic components, such as differentiable theorem provers, to balance scalability and precision. Equally important is the development of evaluation frameworks that stresstest models on perturbed logical statements (e.g., negated premises, swapped quantifiers) to isolate reasoning from memorization. Multimodal reasoning, which grounds inference in diverse modalities (text, images, code), presents untapped potential for enhancing robustness and interpretability. Finally, interdisciplinary collaborationleveraging insights from formal logic, cognitive science, and machine learningwill be essential to design systems that reason with and about uncertainty. Until LLMs reliably disentangle logic from lexicon, their deployment in high-stakes domains will remain precarious. Bridging this gap demands rigorous benchmarks, scalable hybrid methods, and redefinition of evaluation paradigms."
