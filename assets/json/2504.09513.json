            "content": "Figure 1: Disruption image and the restoration result of mural in Eastern Wall, Cave 320, Dunhuang with our DiffuMural model. the cultural heritage community has grown increasingly cautious about relying on hand-coloring methods. In contrast, digital restoration, utilizing digital high-resolution murals as medium, offers greater tolerance for error and presents broader array of solutions for the restoration process [44]. Thus, the exploration of effective digital techniques for restoring these murals in high-resolution is of paramount importance for large-scale restoration and the long-term preservation of these cultural treasures [39, 41]. Deep learning-based image inpainting and restoration methods have made considerable strides in recent years [49], yet they may encounter significant challenges when applied to the restoration of murals. This is due to the unique nature of mural painting, which involves the creation of smooth lines and evocative colors that differ from those typically found in natural images. As such, inpainting techniques designed for natural images may not be well-suited for restoring the distinct edge structures and intricate texture details inherent in murals. Furthermore, the varying degrees of damage to murals often alter the nature of the restoration task, and nearly all current digital restoration technologies are primarily focused on simpler restoration challenges, such as filling small defects and restoring localized color. Notably, heavily damaged murals (refer to Fig. 4a upper part) may have lost substantial amounts of information, rendering the inpainting process ineffective when simulated and learned through existing rectangular or arbitrary masks. Furthermore, we observed that the damaged areas contain wealth of vivid and meaningful content, which holds immense potential to provide crucial insights for the restoration process and should not be overlooked. Inspired by this, we integrate the spatial dynamics of damaged regions in high-resolution murals and propose generative framework, DiffuMural, for the task of restoring large areas of the missing mural. The main contributions can be summarized below: (1) Self-Guidance via Damage Contour: Taking segmentation masks of damaged regions as conditional guidance, ensuring stylistic and textural consistency between the restored and undamaged parts of the mural. (2) Feature Fusion Across Multi-Scale: Integrating information from both low-resolution and high-resolution layers, balancing global structure and local details to enhance the restoration quality and consistency, even with limited sample data. (3) Co-Diffusion Across Multi-Scale: Propagating high-confidence information across layers of different resolutions, resulting in more realistic and seamless integration of the restored areas with the original mural. (4) Humanistic Value Alignment Evaluation: Evaluating the restoration performance with mural restoration experts, ensuring that the restored sections seamlessly blended with the cultural and historical significance of the original artwork."

            "content": "Figure 2: The challenge of our restoration task. Figure 3: Types of mural damages: cracks, flaking, structural collapse, and fading colors Conditional guidance generation. Conditional generation is type of task for generative models that uses conditional inputs to control the features of generated outputs. This task offers significant flexibility and controllability, allowing the model to produce desired outputs based on varying input conditions, which has important applications in image restoration. The core challenge lies in maintaining high generation quality while ensuring strong correlation between the condition and the generated content. Attempts focus on introducing conditional information into generative models. VAE-based methods [12, 28, 36] have high stability, are easy to train, and can effectively integrate conditional information. GAN-based theories and applications [5, 79, 15, 20, 26, 51] feed conditional information to both the generator and discriminator, allowing the generator to produce data in specific style based on the given condition. Conditional diffusion-based models [1, 2, 6, 13, 27, 35, 52, 53] incorporate conditional information into the generation process, producing outputs under specific conditions by controlling diffusion steps. These models demonstrate powerful generative capabilities in tasks such as text and image generation, particularly excelling in high-resolution and detail-rich generation tasks. ControlNet [47] integrates additional guidance, such as edges, depth, or pose information, allowing the model to generate content with greater alignment to specified details, showing great success. Large-scale pre-training. Large-scale pre-training has become cornerstone in modern machine learning, especially in tasks like image generation. Large-scale pre-training enables models like CLIP [31] to learn deep semantic relationships between images and text by training on vast amounts of image-text pairs. Generative models like Stable Diffusion [33] can leverage the mapping provided by CLIP to create high-quality images based on textual descriptions. Large-scale pre-training has been widely used in image retortion and inpainting [10, 18, 19, 21, 23, 40, 43]. By learning from vast amounts of data, pre-trained models can easily understand the context and structure of images, which helps in tasks like inpainting or repairing damaged images, filling in missing parts of an image with realistic details, drawing from learned knowledge of how objects and scenes should appear, offering enhanced accuracy, creativity, and context-aware solutions for repairing and reconstructing images."

Specifically, this paper employs 𝐾-Means based approach to implement edge extraction of damaged region images. The damaged image, with dimensions ℎ 𝑤, is first serialized, where each pixel is treated as an individual. This paper applies the 𝐾-Means clustering algorithm to classify the ℎ𝑤 pixels into two categories, with 𝐾 = 2. The goal of 𝐾-means is to minimize the following objective function: 𝐽 = 𝑛 𝐾 𝑖=1 𝑘= 𝑟𝑖𝑘 𝑥𝑖 𝜇𝑘 2 , 𝑛 = ℎ𝑤, 𝐾 = 2 (1) where 𝑟𝑖𝑘 is binary indicator that equals 1 if specified pixel 𝑥𝑖 belongs to cluster 𝑘, and 0 otherwise. 𝜇𝑘 is the center of cluster 𝑘, which is the mean of all pixels assigned to that cluster. In this case, all pixels are divided into two clusters, foreground and background, allowing for the extraction of the images contours."

However, these treasures face increasing risks\nof irreversible damage due to natural degradation and human ac-\ntivity. Traditional manual restoration methods, while effective, are\nconstrained by time, cost, and ethical concerns. In this context, our\nproposed DiffuMural framework offers a scalable, accurate, and\nculturally sensitive AI-based solution to aid the digital restoration\nof such murals.",
            "content": "By incorporating multi-scale collaborative diffusion mechanism, contour-guided conditioning, and frequency-aware optimization, DiffuMural significantly improves the realism, consistency, and controllability of mural restoration. Unlike generic inpainting models, our method is trained on curated subset of stylistically coherent murals, adhering to restoration ethics by avoiding the hallucination of historically inaccurate content. Furthermore, we introduce human-centric evaluation system, integrating expert feedback from professional restorers to align the generated results with artistic authenticity and cultural significance. The broader societal impact of this work lies in its potential to democratize heritage protection. Through responsible AI for Social Good, DiffuMural provides museums, researchers, and educators with powerful tool to virtually restore, preserve, and present damaged cultural assets. This not only safeguards endangered heritage sites but also fosters greater public engagement and cultural appreciation. As bridge between machine learning and humanistic values, our work represents step forward in using AI to preserve collective memory for future generations."

            "title": "7 Conclusion\nIn this study, addressing the challenge of high-resolution mural\nrestoration, particularly the extensive areas of missing murals and\nthe limited availability of samples, we propose an effective gener-\native AI-based solution, named DiffuMural. We depart from the\nconventional approach of utilizing vast collections of mural data\nfrom various dynasties and styles, which is prevalent in current\nrestoration practices. Instead, we adhere to the core principles and\nethics of traditional manual restoration by training the model ex-\nclusively on a curated collection of 23 murals from the same grotto.\nOn the other hand, we develop a multi-scale collaborative diffusion\nmodel, fine-tuning it for exploratory restoration. Specifically, we\nextract the contours of the damaged areas as inputs to guide the\ndiffusion model for generating inferences, while enhancing feature\nfusion and co-diffusion mechanisms across different scales. Simul-\ntaneously, we introduce quantitative criteria such as stylistic con-\nsistency, texture coherence, edge integrity, and structural similarity,\nestablishing a human value assessment system for the restoration\noutcomes, composed of professional mural restorers. Our results\ndemonstrate that this method achieves superior exploratory restora-\ntion results for large-scale missing Dunhuang murals after iterative\nrefinement, offering valuable reference solutions for the manual\nrestoration of murals faced with similar challenges.",
            "content": "Figure 7: Performance of various models in the subjective evaluation system by mural experts. In our evaluation, six qualitative metrics are employed to assess the performance of digital mural restoration, covering aspects such as detailed restoration, color fidelity, material texture, humanities and arts restoration, visual naturalness, and historical authenticity. Each metric is scored on 0-100 scale, with detailed scoring criteria and quality descriptions provided in the Appendix B."

            "title": "5.4 Qualitative results\nWe conducted comparative restoration experiments on real-world\nmurals. To ensure the professionalism of the restoration process\nand the objectivity of the evaluation, we construct a human value\nassessment system. Concretely, we enlisted 289 distinguished mu-\nral restoration experts from the Dunhuang Academy, the China\nAssociation for the Protection of Cultural Relics, and the Tencent\nSSV Digital Culture Laboratory. These experts assessed over one\nhundred restoration outcomes from seven different methods. The\nevaluations were based on a percentage system across six qualitative\nindicators, with the final performance of each model determined\nby the weighted opinions of the experts, as illustrated in Fig. 7.\nThe results demonstrate that our proposed DiffuMural excels in\nrestoring damaged areas, particularly in crucial visual metrics such\nas color consistency, structural integrity, and visual similarity.",
            "content": "Our method performed exceptionally well in the expert evaluation, maintaining well-balanced set of indicators. This suggests that the proposed approach harmoniously integrates with the cultural and historical significance of the original artwork. While some experts expressed concerns about the ethical and moral dimensions of mural restoration, the method was widely recognized and endorsed by the majority of professionals in the field. Notably, our approach not only represents an innovative solution for restoring large sections of missing murals but also offers solid foundation for making final restoration decisions in real-world mural conservation efforts.
