These table\ncollections have been used to study a variety of data management\ntasks including semantic type annotation (determining the semantic\ntype of an attribute), schema completion, table annotation, schema\nmatching, entity matching, and table search (finding related tables).\nLarge corpora like GitTables are designed to be used in machine\nlearning for table interpretation or understanding tasks [25].",

Unlike previous table corpora that have broad topical coverage and content, we focus on tables describing models. To create our corpus, we make use of three types of resources. First, model repository (or model lake [45]) containing large collection of models described by model cards [41, 54] and data cards which describe training data and benchmarks used in model development [20, 33]. Second, code repository containing code related to the models. Typically model card will link to code repository. Third, paper repository (or to be more specific for our benchmark, two paper repositories) containing scholarly papers that describe the models. Model and data cards, along with code repositories can link to these papers. Note that in our corpus, every table is associated with model (or in the case of duplicates, table may be associated with more than one model)."

Rather, researchers generally\nhand-curate subsets of these corpora or manually manipulate tables\nwithin them to create label benchmarks with ground truth.",
            "content": "Consider, for example, the well-studied related table search. Related tables are typically defined as tables that \"include content that conceivably could have been in single table\" [51], and with this idea in mind most work on related table search focuses on finding tables that can be unioned or joined [4, 12, 43, 61]. For benchmarking, set of labeled tables is created (containing known related and non-related tables), for example the benchmarks for table union search TUS [43] and SANTOS [27] where labels are hand-curated or UGEN [46] where labels are LLM generated. In contrast, we are publishing ModelTables with several possible baseline ground-truth annotations for table relatedness that are generated by model developers themselves. And in contrast to other corpora, we propose using ModelTables to study thematic notion of table relateness, rather than structural one [51]. Our relatedness ground truth comes from three sources. First, model cards link to each other. The first measure of relatedness is model card relatedness: model is related to any model that its model card links (via URL or tag like base_model). Second, data cards also link to each other and other models. Third, paper relatedness is very well studied through the citations in papers and model cards link to papers."

While our\nbenchmark uses open models, code, and papers, our pipeline can\nalso be used in-house to create a resource for private model lakes. In\nsuch a scenario, the paper-relatedness would be replaced by project\nor team relatedness.4 To date, there has been little work to help\ndata-driven organizations manage and understand their own rich\nprivate model lakes. Ours is a first step in demonstrating how struc-\ntured data in a model lake can be used for model understanding.

Our\nbenchmark contains more related tables, with richer relatedness\ndistributions that reflect the real nature of models (some models\nare hubs and related to many models and there is a skewed dis-\ntribution with many models having few models they are related\nto).

Early work\nfocused on joinable table discovery, where DeepJoin [12] uses pre-\ntrained language models to embed column values and perform\nnearest-neighbor search for both syntactic and semantic joins, while\nLSHEnsemble [62] and Josie [61] applies overlap-set indexing to\nefficiently identify tables sharing join keys. Unionable table search\nwas addressed proposed by Nargesian et al. [43]. SANTOS extends\nthis work [27] using knowledge-base-driven semantic relations\nto improve union prediction and D3L by using regular expres-\nsions [4] In parallel, keyword-based table search methods index\ncolumn names and metadata to support ad-hoc textual queries over\nthe lake.

Table reclamation [16] aims to recover missing rows ModelTables: Corpus of Tables about Models or columns in query table by selectively merging content from related tables, effectively healing incomplete datasets. Column disambiguation [2] tackles inconsistent or ambiguous header names by linking them to canonical types or entities, improving interoperability across sources. Table augmentation [57] enriches an existing table with complementary attributessuch as geographic or demographic datapulled from external repositories. By extending classical join, union, and keyword search with these new capabilities, data lakes become far more powerful and flexible for downstream analytics and AI workflows."

Some GitHub URLs point to large checkpoints or code repositories lacking README files or reliable places to find structured tables, and as result do not contribute to our benchmark. arXiv Tables. If model card links to one or more arXiv paper (or has BibTex file for an arXiv paper), we would like to use the tables contained in these papers. If the arXiv link has an HTML version suitable for reliable table extraction, then we extract and use these tables from the markup. At this time, we found that table extraction directly from PDFs did not yield high quality tables, so our benchmark does not include these. To avoid including irrelevant papers and tables, we explicitly exclude the placeholder paper link7, found in the Hugging Faces template model card that many people use as starting point and forget to delete8. Semantic Scholar Tables. If model card links to paper in Semantic Scholar9, we leverage the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC) [38]. S2ORC processes PDF and LaTeX files through its pipeline and saves identified tables, figures, and text sections in its public data dump. However, these extracted tables are unstructured raw text, lacking row-column structure. Therefore, after obtaining this raw table text from the S2ORC data, we pipe it into Large Language Model (LLM) for parsing and refinement. The LLMs task is to convert these unstructured text blocks into clean, uniformly structured table format. 7https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700 8https://huggingface.co/templates/model-card-example 9https://www.semanticscholar.org Zhengyuan Dong, Victor Zhong, and Renée J.

Originating from formats like HTML and Markdown, their underlying structure is analogous to that of common web tables and CSV files and may exhibit complex layouts with multi-level headers or merged cells. Our extract relies on widely-used SOTA table extraction methods [8, 21] designed explicitly for processing highly heterogeneous tables. Specifically, our pipeline handles several challenging edge cases. It resolves Column Alignment Issues from merged or empty cells. It handles Internal Delimiter Conflicts by specially parsing Markdown cells that contain the pipe character (), pattern that exists in some Hugging Face Model Cards. 10 The pipeline preserves context from Cell-Level Annotations by merging footnote text directly into its corresponding cell. It also stitches together fragmented MultiPage Tables and prunes Visual Formatting Artifacts like empty rows. Finally, for Special Characters and Symbols (e.g., lambda, cdot), our approach is to preserve them as-is. Given the vast number of domain-specific notations, preserving the original representation is more robust for maintaining semantic integrity than attempting comprehensive normalization. These targeted corrections ensure all tables are structurally sound. Strategic Filtering. After correcting parsing errors, we apply strategic filtering process to remove tables with significant structural issues or those unsuitable for column-wise analysis. Specifically, our LLM-based recovery over Semantic Scholar extracts yields tables of variable quality, making them appropriate only for an ablation study rather than our main results."

In model lakes, or more generally in scientific tables, authors may present information horizontally, for example, table with column for each of set of benchmark datasets, where the column value is the performance of configuration on that dataset. Conversely, vertical layouts are frequently used when comparing different metrics for single dataset, with metrics arranged as row labels. These stylistic variations mean that 10https://huggingface.co/spacy/nb_core_news_lg ModelTables: Corpus of Tables about Models Figure 2: Tables from RoBERTa [37] and DPS [58] motivate augmentations: transposition for alignment, and headercell fusion for semantic normalization tables representing similar information may have headers and key labels oriented differently. For instance, as shown in Figure 2, what appears as column header in one table might be row header in another. Given the tables from each of our four sources, we create set of tables containing the transpose of each of these tables. Header-to-Cell Augmentation. In addition, we observe that some tables embed header semantics directly into the cell values. typical case is columns that combine categorical labels with numerical data for example, Training Epochs/Steps column may contain entries like 3 epochs or 1500 steps, merging quantity with unit in one cell. This practice, while enhancing human readability, introduces challenges for automated parsing and semantic alignment, as the same conceptual attribute might be split across different structural elements in different tables. We can alleviate this and provide more semantic context for interpreting numeric values in tables but concatenating values with header names. Given the set of tables from any of our four sources, we create header augmentation of this set where for each table every value in the table is concatenated with its attribute header name."

This raises fundamental question: how do we determine if two models are truly related? To answer this, we construct few possible model relatedness graphes. The core concepts guiding the construction of these graphs are formally defined in Table 1. Table 1: Definitions for Model and Table Relatedness. Concept, Definition, and Detection Model Relatedness: connection between models based on their model card or training data. It is modeled via signals at the paper level (citations, shared references), model level (direct model card links or lineage indicated by model tags), and dataset level (common datasets).

Reference overlap is computed over reference lists to capture both direct and latent citation relationships. As an example two papers published almost concurrently may be very related but may not cite each other. However, reference overlap will reveal the relationship. Citation metadata are retrieved from the Semantic Scholar API11 and include two key attributes: citation intent and isInfluential [9, 52]. The intent citations come from Methodology or Results sections of papers and are considered more meaningful than (for example) citations contained in background or related work section, which is derived from multi-class classification model that categorizes the rhetorical role of each citation. The isInfluential is binary indicator to detect if the citation appears to be important, produced by binary classification model that integrates multiple textual and citation-level factors, such as citation frequency, section placement, and contextual emphasis [9, 52]. Of the various types of citation relationships, direct citations are the stricter is some sense than overlap citations, but these two types of relationships will form different relatedness graphs between models (or their tables). Within each set (direct vs. overlap) citations, we 11https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api/tutorial can restrict our consideration to citations that have both the isInfluential and Intent attributes, have one of these, or consider any citation.

            "content": "Model-Level Quality Filtering. We began our benchmark construction from model lake collection of over 1.1M models and their associated model cards. As shown in Figure 3(top), about 68% of these model cards are non-empty, containing at least minimal documentation. Among them, roughly 17% include extractable tables that summarize model characteristics or results. To create high quality corpus of models with scholarly publications, we further restrict to model cards that reference valid research papers. This step substantially narrows the pool, as many community-submitted cards lack formal paper links. To mitigate this sparsity, we integrate other resources, including GitHub READMEs, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar, to recover missing table or citation information. After this augmentation, around 60K models satisfy all quality criteria and form the core of our benchmark. Table-Level Duplication Analysis. The bottom of Figure 3 analyzes the resulting table corpus by showing the frequency of table occurrences after extraction. We observe pronounced long-tailed distribution: most tables appear only once, while few popular or widely reused ones recur many times across model cards. This ModelTables: Corpus of Tables about Models Figure 3: Modeland table-level filtering of the model lake. Top: Stepwise filtering of models by card completeness, table presence, and valid references, yielding the final benchmark subset. Bottom: Table frequency distribution showing longtailed reuse pattern that motivates deduplication. Figure 4: Our benchmark contains larger quantity of smaller tables compared to data lakes, structural profile driven by the distinct characteristics of its academic sources. aligns with our intuition that valid model cards typically contain one or several unique tables, while occasional anomalies correspond to reused or mis-parsed tables. Such evidence validates our deduplication strategy, ensuring that the benchmark retains representative yet non-redundant tables. Benchmark Filtering Overview. Our goal is to refine the raw corpus of extracted tables into high-quality benchmark suitable for computing tableand model-level relatedness. Figure 4 (blue/green shades on the right) summarizes how the dataset contents changed with respect to some table filters. Stage - All -> Dedup (Deduplication insights). Removing redundant tables eliminates the long tail of boilerplate or templatederived tables and retains roughly 17% of the original corpus. Average column counts remain nearly unchanged, while the average number of rows increases slightly, evidence that duplicates are predominantly small, repetitive tables rather than structurally rich ones. Duplication intensity differs strongly by source: the code resource GitHub shows heavy reuse, whereas our two paper sources like arXiv and Semantic Scholar exhibit much less redundancy. Stage - Dedup -> Title (Contain references). The next step links each table to at least one textual anchor, such as modelcard title, GitHub README heading, or paper title. This constraint mainly removes code repository tables lacking citations or bibliographic context while leaving most paper tables intact. Conceptually, the corpus transitions from raw structural artifacts to citation-anchored tables, enabling downstream computation of paperand model-level relationships. Stage - Title -> Valid-Title (Scholarly validation). Titles are then validated against an external scholarly index (Semantic Scholar) to confirm that each refers to verifiable research artifact. After this filtering, the benchmark stabilizes at roughly 105 tables. Within this subset, Model-Card tables that pass validation become noticeably larger (more rows), but narrower (fewer attributes) as larger performance tables predominate. Roughly two-thirds of the model card titles and about one-third of GitHub references fail this match, whereas nearly all papers titles resolve cleanly as expected. The surviving corpus thus reflects academically grounded, structurally consistent content suited for quantitative relatedness analysis. Comparison to existing Corpora and Benchmarks. Figure 4 (orange/red shades on the left) contains several popular table corpora and few data lake benchmarks (the later containing ground truth). Our benchmark exhibits distinct structural and semantic profile compared to classic data-lake benchmarks such as SANTOS [27] and TUS [43] and to newer LLM generated benchmarks UGEN V1/2 [46]. We obtain many more, but smaller tables (comparable in size to the smaller UGEN tables). While the overall statistics differ, the two types of benchmarks remain complementary. Recall the data lake benchmarks are either hand-curated from open data so that ground-truth relatedness is know (TUS/SANTOS) or LMM generated (UGEN). As we report below these benchmarks differ more in the characteristics of the ground truths (relatedness distributions), see Section 5.2. Traditional data lakes capture large-scale structural diversity, whereas our benchmark emphasizes academically structured precision. Together, they offer broader landscape for exploring table discovery, integration, and evaluation methods across heterogeneous domains. In comparison, the (unlabeled) larger Web corpora (WDC, WikiTables, GitTables) contain many more tables. Excluding GitTables, these are typically smaller tables as these come from web pages, and mass-collaboration pages."

In this study, we evaluate to what extend existing related-table search methods can find tables that are related using any of our ground truth measures (model, data, or paper). paper. In this section, we turn to the ground-truth relatedness statistics derived from our three types of relatedness. Paper Relatedness Ground Truth Density. We begin by quantifying the density of the paper relatedness (𝑅paper) of tables for the eight different subsets of 𝑅paper. Table 2. The raw overlap graph connects over 40% of all table pairs, reflecting broad, but noisy linkage. Applying influence or intent filters reduces this density to 1025%, and combining both yields compact around 8% high-confidence core. In contrast, direct citation graphs remain substantially sparser (around 38%), indicating higher precision, but narrower coverage. These statistics confirm that our ground-truth graph preserves sufficient connectivity for meaningful discovery tasks without collapsing into an unrealistically dense structure. The contrasting densities highlight two complementary capabilities of the benchmark. Overlap-based graphs recover indirect semantic relationship. While direct graphs represent explicit citation lineage. Together they form precisionrecall trade-off: overlap offers breadth and higher recall; direct citations offer precision and reliability. Table 2: Paper Relatedness Density across Citation Types. Applying influence and intent filters sparsifies the graph, while overlap-based methods capture indirect relationships resulting in much denser graph. Citation Type Overlap Overlap (Intent) Overlap (Influential) Overlap (Intent Influential) Direct Direct (Intent) Direct (Influential) Direct (Intent Influential) Model Dataset All (Direct Model Dataset) Nonzero Edges Density 43.03% 25.83% 9.94% 8.04% 8.17% 5.76% 3.48% 3.09% 0.19% 0.41% 8.31% 3.71 109 2.23 109 8.59 108 6.95 108 7.06 108 4.98 108 3.01 108 2.67 108 1.71 107 3.51 107 7.18 108 Model and Dataset Density Patterns. The bottom of Table 2, contains the density of the Model and Dataset relatedness over our table graph. The Model relatedness is the sparsest, as expected, and the most precise in terms of semantics. The Dataset relatedness is also sparse, but represents different semantics of relatedness that should be included depending on the task. Table Relatedness Distribution. Using the table-as-query paradigm common in data lakes [42], we further analyze the distribution of related-table counts per query, i.e., how many related tables each query table has (Figure 5). Unlike existing benchmarks such as SANTOS [27] and TUS [43], which define fixed set of queries, our benchmark treats every table as potential query.13 This design yields substantially larger query space, though it does not imply that the underlying distribution is entirely different. Indeed, our 13UGEN is excluded because every query has exactly 10 related tables. Figure 6: Grounding the table discovery task in the Model Lake context. To give meaning to traditional table search (left), we establish ground truth for relatedness (right) by leveraging the rich connections between associated papers, models, and tables. This section presents comprehensive evaluation of multiple table discovery methods on our newly constructed ModelTables benchmark.

This dual approach allows us to compare pure sparse retrieval against the benefits of the cascade hybrid approach. Keyword Search. We use Blends implementation of keyword search [15]. Blend is recent unified table discovery system with collection of discovery operators that include keyword search as well as join, correlation, and union discovery. For Keyword Search, we retrieve tables by matching query table header tokens against candidate table headers and cells. We consider table relevant if query token is contained within candidates content, with candidates then ranked by hit count. Join Search. We use Blends implementation of join search [15]. Given query table, we search for tables that join on the right-most column (typically key column in model lake tables). Following the literature, we do not use headers in this search as the attributes may have different names and still be joinable. Union Search. We use Starmies implementation of union search [43]. Unlike Blend which only considers exact matching of table values, Starmie considers semantic matching and out-performs Blend on this task. Dense Retrieval. We create table embedding that encodes each table (values and headers) as single vector using pretrained Sentence-BERT encoder [50]. Candidate tables are then ranked by the cosine similarity of their embeddings, efficiently performed using FAISS [13]. Sparse Retrieval. Sparse retrieval is traditional IR technique that relies on term-matching and has been used for table retrieval by applying matching on the metadata describing table [40, 56]. Such metadata retrieval leverages the textual context surrounding each table rather than its internal structure. Our preprocessing aggregates raw README text (for Markdown tables) or captions combined with in-text mentions (for arXiv tables) to form local \"in-context\" metadata corpus per table. Notably, when table is associated with multiple metadata texts (due to duplication), all these texts are concatenated to create an augmented corpus for indexing. Queries are generated by serializing these metadata texts into prompts. For sparese retrieval, we use Pyserini [34] sparse-term index with 1024-clause truncation, and Hybrid Retrieval, which first retrieves the top-100 candidates via sparse search and then applies dense Sentence-BERT re-ranking.

This optimistic evaluation setting is designed to estimate the potential upper bound of performance achievable by each of the current state-of-the-art methods. Findings. This section presents the baseline retrieval performance of different methods. The goal is to establish reference points for future improvements and to understand how different data characteristics impact retrieval effectiveness. F1: While All Modern Methods Significantly Outperform Keyword Search, IR methods Outperform Data Lake Methods except Union Search. Our findings  (Table 4)  demonstrate that modern semantic retrieval methodsencompassing approaches based on table content, contextual metadata, and schemaawarenessconsistently and substantially outperform traditional keyword search across all defined ground truths (GTs). Nevertheless, their efficacy is nuanced, varying significantly with the specific semantic signals each method prioritizes. Dense retrieval on tables proved highly effective within the Retrieval Methods, achieving top performance on the Paper GT and the best result overall, which underscores the importance of capturing the semantics of tables. In turn, contextual metadata demonstrated its criticality for specific tasks, with Hybrid retrieval excelling on both Model GT and Dataset GT by leveraging essential contextual information beyond raw table data. While unionable method Starmie demonstrated strong performance, leading the Table Discovery Methods across all GTs. Notably, Starmie was second best for the Paper and All GT indicating unionability is strong signal for Direct paper relatedness. However, it was generally surpassed by Dense and Hybrid retrieval when considering overall or other specific GTs, suggesting potential for enhancement by integrating these semantic signals. And importantly, the tables retrieve by these approaches are different as we show later, further indicating an opportunity for additional research to combine their strengths.

F2: Significant Performance Variation Arises from Differences in Table Source Quality. The source of table significantly impacts its style and data quality. For instance, tables from GitHub and model cards are often rich with developer-curated metadata, while those from academic papers arXiv and Semantic Scholar are more structurally diverse. To analyze this, we evaluated the performance of Unionable search on each source individually and in combination  (Table 5)  . Our analysis reveals dramatic variation in precision based on these sources. Model cards and GitHub tables consistently yield high precision, likely benefiting from their well-curated Markdown format. Note that the Semantic Scholar tables consists of LLMrefined plain text rather than structurally rich HTML or Markdown tables. Hence, the tables are noisier and this dramatically effects the quality of retrieval. This principle of the impact of the source characteristics is further confirmed by our combined-source experiments, which underscore that data homogeneity is critical for achieving high precision. Performance is strongest for the model cards and GitHub (M+G) subset, where tables share consistent Markdown format. Accuracy progressively declines as less-structured arXiv tables are introduced (in M+G+A), and further diminishes with the inclusion of the even more varied Semantic Scholar tables (in M+G+A+S). F3: Domain-Specific Augmentations Enhance the Searchability of Tables. To improve retrieval (especially for numerical tables, which often lack explicit semantic context and have layout variations), we evaluated separately our two data augmentation strategies: adding semantic context (Header Augmentation) and normalizing the layout (Transpose Augmentation). Note that metadata-based retrieval methods are excluded from this analysis, as they do not benefit from table augmentation. Unionable search is excluded, as Starmies runtime depends on column count, which Table 5: Precision@1 of table union search across table resources on different GTs.

Our analysis  (Table 6)  shows the effectiveness of each augmentation. Adding semantic context proved highly effective as it improved precision across all ground truths relatedness (paper, model, and dataset). This confirms that making the implicit meaning of numerical cells explicit is valuable for model lake table retrieval. In contrast, the Transpose Augmentation consistently improves performance only slightly. This demonstrates that the best augmentation strategies for model lake tables is to enrich the tables existing semantics. F4: Robustness and Consistent Performance are Maintained Across Various Ground-Truths. Our benchmark permits the use of different citation semantics in establishing paper relatedness  (Table 2)  . Table 7 presents the precision of union search over eight different citation definitions. Precision predictably drops when stricter GT criteria are applied (meaning fewer citation relationships), direct consequence of the ground truth becoming sparser. This inverse relationship is particularly evident with Paper GT, where precision drops as citation criteria become more stringent. Interestingly, when comparing GTs, those defined by overlap consistently yield higher precision than GTs based on direct citation criteria, suggesting overlap inherently captures broader, denser set of relevant connections. These findings underscore that while retrieval performance metrics are highly sensitive to the definition and statistical properties of the ground truth itself, the methods exhibit consistent behavior even as ground truth criteria become more stringent. This highlights the importance of understanding how GT selection influences reported performance. F5: Structural augmentations are effective in improving retrieval robustness alongside semantic augmentations. In addition to semantic and citation augmentations, we investigate the impact of table structure perturbations, including column and row shuffling. These augmentations are evaluated using Starmie only, as its encoder is specifically designed for structural robustness. Column shuffling at inference yields the largest gains, highlighting that augmenting table structure is practical strategy for robust retrieval across heterogeneous model lakes. We observe that all structural augmentation tricks improve retrieval performance, confirming substantial variation in table styles across authors and sources. Column shuffling provides the largest gains, highlighting that column order is especially arbitraryparticularly in academic tables with semi-structured formats, where unionability is difficult to detect. Structural augmentations, especially at the column level, help the encoder focus on semantic and schema similarities rather than layout, resulting in more robust retrieval in heterogeneous model lakes.

            "content": "Example I: Unionable Search Example. Here we demonstrate using unionable search for GLUE-style performance tables, showcasing the searchs ability to retrieve tables that describe related models. Figure 7 (a) illustrates BERT query table and the Top-2 retrieved tables using Starmie (union table search. these search results are clearly relevant and enable direct, side-by-side comparison of both baseline and advanced models (e.g., BERT [11], RoBERTa [37], MUPPET [1], Uni-Perceive [63]) across consistent set of NLP tasks and evaluation metrics such as MNLI, QNLI, MRPC, SST-2, and SQuAD [49]. These tables exhibit clear structural and semantic alignment, reporting results on overlapping benchmarks that make them unionable. But they are also clearly relevant to data scientist analyzing model behavior. Our observations highlight the limitations of traditional textbased information retrieval methods, which can only address coarsegrained questions such as Which models are available for given task?, falling short on fine-grained performance comparisons at the metric level. Using table search, we can retrieve related and integratable tables that expand the analysis that can be done with the query table alone. This approach enables users to find tables that help them to make precise, context-aware decisions grounded in detailed performance data from multiple models and benchmarks. Example II: Dense Retrieval Example. As shown in Figure 7(b), dense retrieval uncovers tables that, while still centered on BERT variants and key NLP benchmarks such as GLUE and SQuAD, exhibit much greater heterogeneity in schema and reporting style compared to union-based results. Unlike the more schema-aligned tables surfaced by union search, dense retrieval often returns tables with alternative column organizations, extra metrics, or less conventional formattingreflecting the diverse ways authors present experimental results. This flexibility can be seen as major advantage: dense retrieval is able to connect tables that are semantically related but do not share structure or use differing conventions. As result, it can successfully retrieve relevant data even when column names, task sets, or layouts diverge from the query. This capability is especially valuable for scientific corpora where reporting standards vary widely and metadata may be noisy or incomplete. However, dense retrieval is not without limitations. Because it relies on semantic similarity, it tends to retrieve tables with highly overlapping baselines or benchmarksmost notably, results focused on \"BERT-base\"rather than broader variety of model variants or experimental settings. This may result in concentration of retrieved tables that report on the same baselines, potentially missing tables that, while structurally unionable, cover wider range of models or alternative approaches. In contrast, union-based methods, are more likely to surface diverse model variants and experimental configurations, supporting broader comparison across methods. In summary, dense retrieval effectively complements unionbased methods by bridging gaps in schema alignment and surfacing structurally diverse, semantically relevant tables. However, it is less effective in promoting methodological or model diversity, often prioritizing tables with significant overlap in baselines and benchmarks. This suggests there are open research challenges in combining the strengths of both approaches to achieve better model lake performance."

Currently, model lakes rely on keyword search over names and metadata. Semantic search is only just emerging and relies on LLM Q&A over open models. We hypothesize that tables describing related models exhibit high structural and semantic similarity, allowing table discovery to serve as proxy for identifying related models. Scientific tables have been shown to encode rich semantics useful for reasoning and retrieval [10, 31, 39, 55, 60]. Validating this hypothesis requires (1) robust table-retrieval methods and (2) principled ground-truth definition of model relatedness. Model Table Integration While the problem of integrating set of data lake tables has been studied [28], the problem of integrating inconsistent data lake tables, including tables with many numeric values has not received sufficient attention. Using ModelTables, we can identify set of tables about model. We can characterize them into configuration tables, performance tables, and other types of tables. Within each type of table, we can identify inconsistencies in the tables and use integration techniques to resolve inconsistencies and define best integration. We speculate that such research could have implications not only for data integration research, but for research on model card verification and generation [36]. Model Understanding One of the holy grails in model lake research is understanding which model best suits task [45]. To this end, we speculate that using principled search over Model Tables, we may be able to understand which model performs best on different benchmarks and synthesize this rich structured information to do better query answering over models."
