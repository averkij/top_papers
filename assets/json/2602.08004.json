            "content": "Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful paradigm for addressing complex, multi-step tasks that require reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external environments (Yao et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024). Rather than relying on single prompt-response interaction, agents operate over extended horizons: they interpret user goals, decompose them into sub-tasks, and coordinate actions across diverse tools, data sources, and intermediate states (Shinn et al., 2023; Wang 1 Figure 1: Growth trend of agent skills. According to the well-known agent skills platform skills.sh, the number of recorded skills experienced rapid growth from mid-January to early February 2026, exceeding 40,000 by early February. During the same period, the popular open-source skills application OpenClaw (openclaw Community, 2026) saw sharp surge in GitHub stars, reaching over 25,000 stars in single day at the end of January, followed by gradual decline, with the total number of stars exceeding 170k. et al., 2023; Sapkota et al., 2025). This agentic execution model has enabled growing range of applications, from software development and data analysis to personal assistance and workflow automation (Wang et al., 2024). As agent-based systems scale in both complexity and deployment, new challenges arise around reliability, reuse, and maintainability (Liu et al., 2026a; Cemri et al., 2025; Raheem and Hossain, 2025). Many agent behaviors recur across tasks and users, yet are repeatedly re-specified through prompts or handcrafted control logic (Jin et al., 2026; Liu et al., 2025). This has motivated the emergence of agent skills (openclaw Community, 2026; Anthropic, 2025). The ecosystem around these skills has expanded rapidly in recent months, as reflected in Figure 1. This growth motivates closer look at what skills exist, how they are adopted, and what risks they may introduce. What are agent skills? Agent skills have recently emerged as an abstraction for structuring reusable and scalable agent behaviors (Anthropic, 2025; Wu and Zhang, 2026; Lee, 2025). The concept has been systematized and popularized by Anthropic in the context of the Claude agent framework (Anthropic, 2025), where skills are sometimes referred to as Claude Skills or Claude agent skills. An agent skill can be defined as reusable, plug-and-play module that specifies when the skill should be invoked and how the corresponding subtask should be carried out, typically in form that can be shared, versioned, and composed. In practical implementations, skill often combines lightweight metadata that supports discovery and selection with executable instructions and supporting resources such as files, scripts, and tool configurations (Anthropic, 2025). Appendix provides concrete example of skill structure. Why do agents need skills? Agent-based systems often revisit similar subtasks, such as data retrieval, information extraction, code modification, etc. Without explicit abstractions, these recurring behaviors must be specified repeatedly, either through prompts or through ad hoc control logic. This repetition increases prompt overhead, makes behavior brittle under small context changes, and complicates maintenance of shared procedures (Jin et al., 2026). Agent skills address these issues by packaging reusable behaviors into modular units that capture task knowledge, procedural logic, and tool use patterns. Because skills can be reused and composed, they improve behavioral consistency and reduce prompt complexity, making agent capabilities easier to extend and control. Shared skill libraries also support standardization and continuous refinement across applications. How are agent skills used in practice? In real systems, skills are typically organized as selfcontained modules that an agent can select and execute during task solving. common pattern is to load eligible skills into the system prompt as compact list of metadata with names and descriptions; the agent then selects skill based on the user request and follows the skill-defined instructions, issuing tool calls as needed. Appendix provides concrete example (Figure 11) that illustrates how an agent uses different skills to solve user questions. Taken together, these observations suggest that agent skills are growing quickly, but their functions and potential impacts vary widely. This makes it important to characterize what skills exist, how they are used, and what risks they may introduce. In this paper, we present large-scale, data-driven measurement of the emerging agent skills ecosystem. Using corpus collected from public skill platform, we analyze the following aspects: Growth trends in Section 2: we quantify publication over time and show rapid, bursty growth. Skill length and redundancy in Section 3: we measure prompt length and show heavy-tailed distribution, while most skills stay within typical prompt budgets. We also find that near-duplicate listings are common. Skill usage patterns in Section 4: we classify skills into taxonomy with 6 major categories and 20 sub-categories, and we show strong concentration in software engineering workflows. We further identify clear gaps between what is published and what users install. Safety risks in Section 5: we audit skills and find that most are low risk, while non-trivial share enables state-changing actions. Our results point to several open problems. First, the supplydemand gaps and high redundancy call for better skill discovery, de-duplication, and quality signals. Second, the presence of action-enabling skills motivates safety-aware design, including clearer permission models, stronger sandboxing, and more transparent risk labeling."

To capture parallel signal of community attention, we also track the popularity of OpenClaw (openclaw Community, 2026) by querying its GitHub star history via the GitHub GraphQL API (api.github.com/graphql). Figure 1 plots the cumulative number of listed skills and the cumulative number of OpenClaw stars. Growth is rapid and bursty. The marketplace grows from 2,179 skills on January 16, 2026 to 40,285 skills on February 5, 2026, net increase of 38,106 skills in 20 days. This corresponds to an 18.5 increase and an average multiplicative growth rate of about 15.7% per day. Despite mean inflow of 1,918 skills per day, arrivals are concentrated in short spikes. The largest spike occurs on January 25, 2026, when 8,857 skills are added in single day. This accounts for 23.2% of all new skills in the window. At the weekly level, the week centered on January 25 contributes 19,259 skills, or 47.8% of the full snapshot. Growth aligns with an application-level popularity signal. OpenClaw exhibits concurrent popularity shock. Daily new stars rise from the hundreds in mid-January to 10,543 on January 25, then peak at 25,432 on January 26, which is 2.4 the previous day. After the peak, daily gains decline into early February. For example, OpenClaw gains 1,718 new stars on February 5, which coincides with the slowdown in new listings. Taken together, the synchronized spikes suggest shared driver. wave of public attention likely encouraged both skill publication and exploration of skill-based tooling.

For every skill record in Section 2.1, we consistently use tiktoken (OpenAI, 2026) with the o200k_base encoding. This approach allows token counts to serve as straightforward proxy for prompt budget and inference cost. Typical skills are short. Figure 2 shows pronounced heavy-tailed distribution, but most skills are still compact. The median length is 1,414 tokens and the mean is 1,895 tokens, indicating that typical skill fits comfortably alongside planning context and tool schemas. Across quantiles, length is rarely binding constraint: 80% and 95% of skills are within 2,955 and 5,077 tokens, and 90% and 99% remain below 3,935 and 9,253 tokens. Meanwhile, the standard deviation of 2,025 tokens highlights substantial dispersion, even though the central mass is short. few skills are long due to the inclusion of multiple components. This dispersion is driven by small set of extreme outliers. The top 1% of skills exceed 9,253 tokens, and the maximum reaches 116,239 tokens, which can consume prompt budgets and hinder reliable selection and auditing when Figure 3: Name based redundancy distribution. Skills are grouped by normalized names using case insensitive matching after removing special characters. We report the fraction of skills that appear times, denoted as n. Skills that appear once account for 53.7%, while skills that appear more than once account for 46.3%. The names of the 30 most redundant skills under this metric are listed in Appendix Figure 4. loaded in full. Manual inspection suggests that many of these long skills consolidate multiple components into single file, including extended documentation, large code blocks, and reusable template collections. This pattern indicates that, while most skills support direct in-context use, minority behave like libraries and may benefit from modularization or retrieval-based loading so only the relevant portions are brought into context. 3. Intent-level Redundancy Analysis As the agent skills ecosystem grows, identical user intents are frequently published more than once, either by independent developers or through template-driven generation. Moderate repetition can be beneficial when it produces meaningfully improved variants, such as stronger safety checks, broader tool coverage, or clearer documentation. However, when most copies differ only in wording, marketplace volume rises without corresponding increase in capability diversity. We therefore quantify redundancy as the frequency with which the same intent is re-listed in the corpus. Redundancy measuring. We estimate redundancy with two signals. First, we apply namebased exact matching. We lowercase skill names, remove special characters, and group skills that share the same normalized name. Second, we apply semantic matching. We encode Name:[NAME] + Description:[DESCRIPTION] with BAAI/bge-m3 (Chen et al., 2024), and analyze nearest neighbor similarity together with t-SNE visualizations. In this marketplace, descriptions are often short, noisy, and template derived, so semanFigure 4: Top 30 redundant skills by name based matching. We rank skills by the number of listings that share the same normalized name, using the exact matching procedure in Section 3.2. This figure lists the 30 most frequently repeated skill names and their repetition counts. tically similar embeddings do not reliably separate true duplicates from loosely related skills. For this reason, we use strict name matching for the main results and report the embedding analysis in Appendix B. Nearly half of listings are duplicates. Figure 3 shows that unique entries only slightly outnumber repeated ones. Under strict exact matching, 53.7% of skills appear once, while 46.3% share normalized name with at least one other listing. Duplication is also concentrated. Pairs are common, with 2 groups contributing 18.7% of the corpus. Higher multiplicities still account for nontrivial share: 5 to 9 groups contribute 14.3%, and 10 to 49 groups contribute 8.8%. small number of names appear more than 100 times, which is consistent with repeated reposting or automated publication from shared templates. For concreteness, we provide the 30 most redundant skill names in Figure 4. Implications for discovery and maintenance. High redundancy increases user search costs and fragments feedback and adoption signals across near identical listings, which makes it harder for high quality implementations to become clear defaults. It also indicates that developer effort is often spent re-packaging common workflows rather than"

Adoption follows different pattern from publication. Web Search has the highest mean downloads at 1,268, but it represents only 1.4% of listings. This indicates that small number of retrieval conFigure 7: Supplydemand dynamics by sub-category.

The figure highlights where publication volume and adoption diverge at finer granularity than Figure 6. terest. However, we observe three consistent gaps. First, content creation is demand-heavy. Users repeatedly reuse writing and media workflows, even when the number of listings is modest. Second, software engineering is supply-heavy. Skills that wrap coding, testing, and repository routines are easy to produce and share, which increases overlap and spreads installs across close substitutes. Third, information retrieval (Zheng et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025) is demand-heavy despite limited supply. small number of reliable retrieval skills can attract many installs because web and database access is useful for everyday tasks. However, publishing these skills is costly because it requires stable connectors, careful query design, and ongoing maintenance as external interfaces and rate limits change.

Together, these results highlight where canonical implementations, stronger tool integration, and maintenance incentives may reduce supply-demand mismatches."

Relative to prompt-only interactions, they expand the harm surface because skill may access sensitive data or trigger real-world side effects (Wu and Zhang, 2026; Schmotz et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2026b). We therefore quantify how often published skills enable privacy-sensitive reads, state-changing actions, or critical capabilities such Figure 8: Risk level distribution overall and by major category, where L0 is the lowest risk and L3 is the highest, audited with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using Appendix E. as arbitrary command execution.

The model receives the skill name, description, and full SKILL.md content, and assigns exactly one risk level from L0 to L3 under worst-case interpretation, where L0 is safe, L1 is privacy risk, L2 is moderate risk, and L3 is critical risk. To support automatic aggregation, we require strict JSON response: {\"skill_name\": \"{{SKILL_NAME}}\", \"risk_level\": \"L0\" \"L1\" \"L2\" \"L3\", \"reasoning\": \"A (cid:44) concise sentence explaining the specific risk factor.\"} (cid:44) (cid:44) We report results by the six major categories from Section 4.2.

Overall, 54% are L0, 5% are L1, 30% are L2, and 9% are L3. Thus, nearly two fifths of the marketplace can access sensitive context or perform writes and actions, and nontrivial share exposes critical capabilities. Category-level patterns. Risk concentrates in categories that connect the model to external systems. Content Creation is the safest category, with 75% L0 and only small L3 share, which matches workflows whose outputs are mainly drafts or media artifacts. Information Retrieval is largely read oriented, with 68% L0 and the largest L1 share at 11%, often because connectors rely on user-specific tokens or private sources. Productivity Tools is dominated by L2 at 46%, reflecting common actions such as creating, editing, and sending emails, messages, calendar entries, and documents. Software Engineering has the highest L3 fraction at 7 Second, the heavy tailed length distribution of skills tokens means small fraction of skills can dominate prompt budgets. Future systems should support selective loading and modularization, retrieving only the steps, parameters, and tool schemas needed for the current subgoal. Summarization, pruning unused branches, and instruction compression can further reduce overhead while preserving faithful execution. Third, our observed supply-demand gaps in Agent Skills indicate that publication effort does not always track user adoption. In particular, information retrieval attracts high usage but remains costly to build and maintain, while many software engineering skills compete as close substitutes. Future Skills platforms can use demand signals to guide authoring tools, incentives, and review effort, and can support demand driven synthesis that adapts existing skills to new connectors, domains, and user constraints. Finally, the presence of high-risk skills calls for the establishment of proactive security protocols. Current frameworks lack fine-grained control over state-changing actions. Future research should implement standardized sandboxing environments that enforce the principle of least privilege. Such protocols would allow agents to perform complex tasks while protecting the host system from unauthorized or malicious operations."

            "content": "In this paper, we conducted large-scale, datadriven measurement of the agent skills ecosystem, analyzing over 40,000 publicly listed skills. Across production, adoption, redundancy, and safety auditing, our results provide quantitative snapshot of skills as an emerging abstraction for extending large language model agents. Overall, the ecosystem is expanding quickly but unevenly: supply is dominated by software engineering skills, intentlevel redundancy is pervasive, and adoption concentrates on smaller set of high-demand capabilities, notably information retrieval and content creation. From safety perspective, although most skills appear low risk, non-trivial subset enables state-changing or system-level actions, underscoring the need for safety-aware skill design and review. Taken together, these findings position agent skills as measurable infrastructure layer for agent systems and motivate future work on standardization, reuse, and governance.

L0 lists safe design words like \"visual\" and \"component.\" L1 focuses on private data with terms like \"meeting\" and \"history.\" L2 shows action words like \"git\" and \"merge.\" L3 highlights critical system and security terms such as \"sudo,\" \"admin,\" and \"password.\" 14%, consistent with skills that manage environments, run commands, or manipulate repositories. Utilities & Other also shows elevated L1 at 10% and L3 at 11%, driven by local file operations and command execution utilities. Data & Analytics falls between these extremes, with 59% L0 and 23% L2, consistent with ETL-style pipelines that may write intermediate outputs. Figure 9 further presents detailed word cloud analysis across different risk levels from L0 to L3. Words are retained only if their frequency in the target level exceeds 1.5 times the average of the remaining three levels. Overall, the most severe cases are less about content generation and more about enabling external side effects. These results motivate least-privilege tool design and additional safeguards for high-risk operations."

Given pervasive intent level duplication, future work should pair semantic de duplication with quality signals including documentation, execution reliability, maintenance, and usage. practical goal is convergence to small set of canonical skills per intent, so developers extend capabilities instead of re packaging the same workflows."

            "content": "Our study has two main limitations. First, our measurements are derived from single snapshot of one public marketplace collected around early February 2026. As platform policies, ranking algorithms, and community composition evolve, both the supply and the demand for skills may change, and the bursty growth patterns we report may not persist. Second, we operationalize adoption using publicly visible signals rather than verified executions inside deployed agents. These signals can be affected by interface changes, caching, and social dynamics such as coordinated promotion, and they may under represent private usage that occurs through enterprise deployments or custom agent stacks."

            "content": "Skills provide modular and expressive mechanism for extending agent capabilities. By encapsulating triggering conditions, procedural logic, and tool interactions, skills enable agents to compose complex behaviors dynamically at runtime, while keeping the core agent architecture lightweight and unchanged. A.1 Skill Structure Skills act as first-class capability abstractions in an agent system, allowing agents to solve complex tasks through structured and reusable procedures. Unlike ad hoc prompts or isolated tool calls, each skill is defined as lightweight, program-like unit with explicit execution semantics. Formally, skill can be represented as: Skill = {Metadata, Instructions, Resources}, where metadata specifies the applicability conditions of the skill, instructions define the procedural steps to be executed, and resources link the skill to external tools, scripts, APIs, or auxiliary artifacts. In practice, each skill is organized within dedicated directory containing SKILL.md file that materializes this abstraction. As shown in Fig. 10, SKILL.md begins with YAML frontmatter that specifies the skill name and concise description. This metadata serves as compact semantic signal for skill discovery and selection. The remainder of the file is written in Markdown and encodes the Figure 11: Dynamic skill integration during agent execution. Given user request, the agent reasons over the injected skill index and selects the most relevant skill based on semantic matching. The full skill specification is then loaded, and the agent follows the skills instructions, potentially invoking external tools and producing intermediate outputs. Different user intents trigger different skills, enabling modular, reusable, and contextaware agent behavior through conditional skill selection and state-driven transitions. procedural logic of the skill, including high-level processing stages, decision criteria, and concrete instructions for tool invocation. This design separates lightweight skill discovery from full procedural execution. During agent initialization, only the metadata is exposed to the model, minimizing prompt overhead. Detailed instructions and associated resources are loaded only when skill is selected, enabling rich, tool-augmented behavior without inflating the agents baseline context. A.2 Skill Integration in Agents Beyond the definition of individual skills, agent intelligence critically depends on how multiple skills are dynamically coordinated during task execution. At the start of session, the agent is provided with summarized index of available skills, consisting of their names and descriptions. Given user request, the agent performs high-level reasoning to infer the underlying goal and decompose it into subgoals. Rather than following fixed execution pipeline, the agent conditionally selects skills based on the current subgoal and the evolving internal state. Once skill is invoked, the agent follows the skills procedural instructions, potentially interacting with external tools and producing structured intermediate outputs. These outputs are incorporated into the agents internal state and directly influence subsequent decisions. For instance, the execution operations."

The prompt provides definitions for all 6 major categories and 20 subcategories, and it takes the skill name and description as input.

            "content": "To assess potential harms beyond content, we use LLM to label each skill by security risk. Figure 15 shows the full prompt used by LLM. The prompt asks the LLM to consider how skill interacts with data and tools, and to assign the highest applicable level under worst-case interpretation. We define four levels, from L0 for read-only public operations to L3 for high-impact actions such as destructive writes or arbitrary command execution. The model must output strict JSON so the labels can be parsed at scale and reviewed. The Examples of High-Risk (L3) Skills High-Risk (L3) skills are those that, if misused, prompt-injected, or misconfigured, may enable irreversible or high-impact actions. Typical cases include arbitrary command execution, handling of credentials and other secrets, escalation to privileged access, and operations that directly move or manage financial assets. To make these risks concrete, Table 2 summarizes representative examples across multiple major categories and provides concise rationales (see Section 5 for details) that follow worst-case reading of the skill instructions and tool interfaces. To protect the privacy of skill contributors, we omit skill names and redact identifiable keywords in black xxx. Moreover, we also highlight risk-related keywords in light yellow to help readers quickly locate the primary sources of risk in corresponding skill. of an analysis skill may introduce new constraints or observations, which in turn determine whether the agent invokes refinement skill, explores alternative strategies, or proceeds to synthesis step. As result, skill execution induces non-linear control flow in which transitions between skills are determined by intermediate state updates rather than pre-defined task graphs. Through iterative reasoning, skill selection, and execution, multiple skills collaboratively contribute to the completion of complex tasks. Fig. 11 illustrates this execution paradigm. The agent alternates between reasoning over the current state, selecting an appropriate skill from the available index, and executing the selected skill to update its state. Importantly, this coordination emerges from model-driven decision-making over skill abstractions, without relying on hard-coded orchestration rules or manually designed workflows."

First, we report redundancy under exact name-based matching, which is conservative signal that is easy to interpret. Figure 4 shows that small set of generic names is repeatedly published. This pattern is consistent with template reuse and re-packaging of common workflows. Because name matching does not capture paraphrases, the true amount of redundancy is likely larger, which motivates our additional near-duplicate analysis in the main text. Second, we visualize skills in low-dimensional space to show how closely they cluster by functionality as shown in Figure 12. It provides complementary view based on semantic similarity. Skills form visible clusters within and across sub-categories, suggesting that many listings share overlapping intent even when their names differ."
