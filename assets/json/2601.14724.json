            "content": "Recent years have witnessed remarkable evolution in the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in video understanding tasks [4, 12, 23]. Despite the progress, the rapid emergence of real-time applications demands stable long video understanding, low-latency response, and memory-efficient deployment. However, existing MLLMs struggle to simultaneously satisfy these requirements on streaming videos. Notably, TimeChat-Online [50] observes that large number of streaming video tokens are redundant, motivating compression methods to address these challenges. While numerous compression techniques have been proposed for offline videos [40, 44, 48], most are ill-suited for memory management in streaming scenarios, as streaming inputs are unpredictable in future frames and queries. To adapt to streaming inputs, recent research introduces specialized memory management techniques, which Equal contribution. Corresponding author. 1 (a) HERMES Framework (b) Attention Analysis (c) Efficiency Test Figure 1 Left: HERMES is training-free approach for efficient streaming video understanding, enabling stable inference by reusing KV cache and performing hierarchical management of video tokens stored in KV cache. Middle: HERMES is based on mechanistic investigation of the layer-wise attention preferences over hierarchical video information. Right: We evaluate LLaVA-OV-7B on single A800 GPU (80 GB). As input frames increase, HERMES consistently maintains extremely low latency (TTFT < 30 ms) and stable GPU memory consumption, exhibiting no risk of OOM errors and requiring no auxiliary external computational resources. generally fall into two paradigms: external memory and internal memory. External memory methods store video content as captions or raw vision patches in databases, and perform ad-hoc retrieval and multimodal prefilling at query time [45, 47], suffering from high latency and lack of end-to-end cohesion. Additionally, many of these methods necessitate costly model-specific training [41, 46, 51]. In contrast, internalizing memory directly into the key-value cache (KV cache) remains underexplored, yet is crucial for low-latency responses and seamless end-to-end reasoning over stored video contexts. Moreover, KV cache naturally acts as latent, model-intrinsic memory [19] that frequently interacts with the video stream, making it particularly suitable for training-free memory management. ReKV [13] and LiveVLM [31] are representative training-free, cache-based methods for streaming memory management. They store previous video segments in external CPU or disk and need to perform an additional retrieval when user query arrives, which still rely on external computational resources and leads to significant latency. StreamMem [49] leverages chat template tokens to guide compression but lacks fine-grained KV management and mechanistic interpretability. To overcome the aforementioned limitations of existing streaming video methods, we propose HERMES (KV Cache as HiERarchical Memory for Efficient Streaming Video Understanding), training-free and plugand-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs. Grounded in mechanistic investigation of layer-wise attention shown in Fig. 1b, we conceptualize KV cache as hierarchical memory framework that stores video information across multiple levels of granularity: shallow layers function as sensory memory, exhibiting strong recency bias toward newly arriving frames; deep layers act as long-term memory, focusing on frame-level rhythmic anchor tokens; and middle layers serve as transitional working memory that balances recency information with frame-level semantic representations. Our method HERMES comprises three components: hierarchical KV cache management, cross-layer memory smoothing, and position re-indexing. During inference, HERMES reuses the compact KV cache and requires no auxiliary computations or external devices upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses. Experiments show that HERMES maintains stable and accurate performance with up to 68% fewer video tokens, while maintaining consistently low response latency and constant GPU memory footprint. 2 (a) Shallow layer attention.

Figure 2 Visualization of the average attention weights (log scale) for user queries over video tokens in LLaVA-OV-7B with FIFO KV cache budget of 6K video tokens per layer, averaged across 300 user video questions. To summarize, our main contributions are as follows: 1. Grounded in mechanistic analysis on attention visualization, we pioneer the conceptualization of KV cache as hierarchical video memory framework across multiple granularities. 2. We propose HERMES, training-free method for streaming video understanding by reusing hierarchically managed KV cache. Despite reducing video tokens by up to 68%, HERMES achieves competitive accuracy, with gains of up to 11.4% on streaming benchmarks. 3. HERMES exhibits outstanding efficiency in streaming scenarios. Compared to the prior training-free SOTA method, it achieves up to 10 speedup in latency. With constant, compact GPU memory footprint and no auxiliary computation at query time, HERMES ensures consistently low-latency responses."

            "title": "2 Layer-wise Preference for Hierarchical Streaming Video Information",
            "content": "Sliding Window is standard paradigm for streaming video processing by incrementally encoding the continuous video stream chunk by chunk. When KV cache reaches the pre-defined memory budget, token eviction is triggered, and deciding which tokens to keep is crucial for stable understanding. Existing methods [13, 46, 49] rely on coarse-grained eviction strategies such as FIFO uniformly across all layers, overlooking layer-wise attention preferences. To fill this gap, we conduct mechanistic investigation of attention preferences in MLLM decoder layers, revealing how layers specialize in storing multiple-granularity video memory. To derive generalized insights, we randomly sample 100 video-question pairs from each of the short (62s3 - 141s), medium (251s - 1,092s) and long (1,795s - 3,579s) duration subsets of the VideoMME benchmark [16] to cover diverse video durations and user queries. The video samples are uniformly sampled at 0.5 fps and subsequently fed into LLaVAOV-7B in streaming chunk-wise manner, with each chunk containing 8 frames. LLaVA-OV-7B consists of 28 decoder layers, and each video frame is uniformly encoded into 196 visual tokens. During the prefilling stage for video tokens, we maintain constant budget 𝑀 of 6K video tokens per KV cache layer. After each eviction step, the positional indices of tokens per KV cache layer are re-indexing to contiguous [0, 𝑀). Layer-wise attention visualizations over video tokens maintained in FIFO KV cache in Fig. 2 reveal three general stages of attention preference, along with more visualization results presented in App. A: Shallow Layers as Sensory Memory: As shown in Fig. 2a, the shallow layers (e.g., layer 0) exhibit an intense recency bias, with attention sharply concentrated on the most recent visual tokens and rapidly decaying over earlier ones. This behavior aligns with the concept of Sensory Memory [2, 37]: shallow 3To ensure the sliding window contains 6,000 tokens, video at 0.5 fps for LLaVA-OV must have duration of at least 6, 000/196/0.5 62𝑠. Figure 3 Overview of the HERMES architecture for streaming video QA. By implementing hierarchical KV cache and specialized management strategies, HERMES enables real-time and accurate responses through direct cache reuse, eliminating the need for additional retrieval operations or external memory whenever users pose questions. layers function as short-lived buffer for the most recent visual inputs, enabling the model to quickly perceive incoming frames. Deep Layers as Long-term Memory: In deep layers (e.g., layer 26 in Fig. 2b), recency bias largely disappears. Instead, the attention pattern becomes highly sparse and rhythmic, with local extrema appearing at regular intervals. These extrema are exactly = 196 tokens apart, matching to the number of tokens encoding single frame in LLaVA-OV-7B. These local maxima can be regarded as frame-level anchor tokens, summarizing the visual information of each frame. This pattern reflects Long-term Memory [2, 37]: deep layers store critical frame-level semantic representations for long-horizon understanding. Middle Layers as Working Memory: Middle layers (e.g., layer 8 in Fig. 2c) exhibit gradual reduction in recency bias, with attention more evenly distributed across recent and earlier tokens. Simultaneously, the attention begins to transition toward the rhythmic patterns in the deep layers. This behavior corresponds to Working Memory [3, 19]: middle layers integrate recent and earlier visual information, bridging shortterm sensory traces with frame-level semantic summaries."

            "title": "3.1 Hierarchical KV Cache Management",
            "content": "Motivated by the layer-wise attention patterns identified in Sec. 2, we design hierarchical KV cache strategy. For each video token with KV cache index 𝑖 at layer 𝑙, where 𝑖 denotes its physical position in KV cache, we compute an importance score 𝑆𝑙 𝑖 to decide its retention: Shallow Layers: They act as sensory memory with strong recency bias. Inspired by Ebbinghausmemory decay theory [14], we model token importance using an exponential forgetting curve based on temporal distance: 𝑖 = 𝛼𝑙 𝑆𝑙 𝑖 𝑒𝑘Δ𝑡𝑖 , Δ𝑡𝑖 = 𝑇 1 𝑖, (1) where 𝑇 is the total number of video tokens in the cache, 𝑘 > 0 is the forgetting rate, 𝛼𝑙 𝑖 denotes the 4 normalization factor. Deep Layers: Deep layers function as frame-level long-term memory with stable anchor tokens. Their attention distributions are sparse, and these anchor tokens consistently receive high attention across frames, making attention magnitude reliable indicator of long-term importance. We therefore compute token importance directly from attention weights with respect to the user query. To handle unpredictable queries in streaming scenarios, we use generic guidance prompt (see App. B) as pseudo query. Token importance is computed as: where 𝑊 𝑙 𝑖 denotes the attention weight of the 𝑖-th token at the layer 𝑙. 𝑖 = 𝛼𝑙 𝑆𝑙 𝑖 𝑊 𝑙 𝑖 , Middle Layers: Middle layers serve as working memory, transitioning from recency-dominated shallow layers to attention-driven deep layers. We compute importance by interpolating recency and attention with layer-dependent weight: 𝜔𝑙 = 𝜔0 𝛾 𝑙 𝑙short 𝑙long 𝑙short , (3) where 𝑙short and 𝑙long denote the layer indices, with 𝜔0 = 0.75 and 𝛾 = 0.6. The importance score of token 𝑖 at layer 𝑙 is then computed as 𝑖 = (1 𝜔𝑙) 𝐴𝑙 𝑆𝑙 𝑖 + 𝜔𝑙 𝑅𝑙 𝑖 , 𝑖 and 𝑅𝑙 where 𝐴𝑙 in Eqs. (1) and (2). 𝑖 denote the normalized attention weight and recency score, respectively, computed as"

            "content": "Hierarchical KV cache management may introduce cross-layer inconsistency, as tokens at the same cache index can be evicted independently across layers, leading to misaligned visual memory. Since effective LLM memory relies on cross-layer interaction [6, 19, 33, 39], we address this issue with Cross-Layer Memory Smoothing. Instead of treating video tokens at the same KV cache index as independent across layers, we propagate and smooth importance signals from deeper to shallower layers. Given raw importance scores 𝑆𝑙 𝑖 , the smoothed score is computed as: 𝑆𝑙 𝑖 = (1 𝜆𝑙) 𝑆𝑙 𝜆 [0, 1] is the smoothing hyperparameter that controls the strength of cross-layer smoothing. 𝑖 + 𝜆𝑙 𝑆𝑙+1 , 𝑖 We then apply Top-K selection based on 𝑆𝑙 𝑖 to maintain fixed memory budget 𝑀 per layer: ℐ𝑙 = TopK( 𝑆𝑙 , 𝑀), 𝐾𝑙 = 𝐾𝑙[ℐ𝑙], 𝑉𝑙 = 𝑉𝑙[ℐ𝑙]. (2) (4) (5) (6) To preserve long-term information, evicted tokens are aggregated into summary token per layer, which compactly encodes long-term memory and is retained in the KV cache (see App. F)."

            "content": "Continuous accumulation of streaming inputs causes positional indices to exceed the models maximum supported range, severely degrading text generation quality. To stabilize inference, we apply position reindexing, which remaps positional indices to contiguous range [0, 𝑀) within the memory budget 𝑀. We design two strategies: Lazy Re-Indexing Re-indexing is triggered only when positional indices approach the model limit, resulting in lower computational overhead. By preserving the original positional indices of recent tokens, it prevents 5 positional drift compared to eager re-indexing, making it well suited for streaming video understanding. Eager Re-Indexing Re-indexing is performed at each compression step, maintaining strictly contiguous RoPE indices in KV cache. While this strategy stabilizes long-range visual semantics [21, 22, 46], it leads to higher computational cost due to frequent re-indexing, making it more suitable for offline videos. The details of re-indexing implementation for 1D RoPE (LLaVA-OV) and 3D M-RoPE (Qwen2.5-VL) are illustrated in App. E.1 and App. E.2, respectively."

The details of utilized benchmarks are demonstrated in App. D. Models. To further verify the broad applicability of our method, we select two popular open-source MLLM series, LLaVA-OneVision (LLaVA-OV) [23] and Qwen2.5-VL [5].

For Qwen2.5-VL, we maintain its native dynamic resolution on video input, ensuring fair comparison with the base model. Implementation Details. For evaluating HERMES across all benchmarks, each video is encoded and processed chunk by chunk, with 16 frames per chunk, and sequentially prefilling the backbone LLM. Then, token compression is triggered once the predefined memory budget is exceeded. For the layer partition, we follow the mechanistic investigations presented in Sec. 2: 10% shallow, 60% middle and 30% deep layers. more comprehensive analysis of attention behaviors as supportive evidence can be found in Fig. 6. The cross-layer memory smoothing hyperparameter 𝜆 proposed in Sec. 3.2 is layerdependent, with detailed configurations reported in App. C. All evaluations are conducted using FP16 mixed precision and efficiency tests are conducted on single A800 GPU, consistent with prior works [8, 13]. Greedy decoding is used to generate deterministic outputs. Accuracy evaluations can be completed on one H200 GPU."

Memory Budget To investigate the impact of memory budget on understanding performance, we conduct ablations by varying the memory budget 𝑀 from 1K to 10K. As shown in Fig. 5a, for HERMES built upon LLaVA-OV-7B, the performance on both streaming and offline datasets stabilizes once memory budget reaches 4K. Notably, streaming datasets can tolerate smaller memory budget. In contrast, the performance on long offline datasets degrades significantly when the memory budget is below 4K. The ablation on Qwen2.5-VL-7B is provided in Fig. 5b, yielding conclusions consistent with those on LLaVA-OV-7B. Cross-Layer Memory Smoothing In Tab. 5, we evaluate variants without the proposed cross-layer memory smoothing mechanism, as well as alternative hyperparameter configurations. All these variants exhibit degraded performance on the VideoMME benchmark, demonstrating both the critical role of memory smoothing and the effectiveness of our chosen hyperparameter settings. Position Re-Indexing Strategies For all streaming evaluations, we adopt the lazy position re-indexing strategy, while we use the eager re-indexing strategy for offline evaluations. Ablation studies in Tab. 7 and Tab. 8 show 9 (a) Performance comparison of LLaVA-OV-7B across different memory budgets. (b) Performance Comparison of Qwen2.5-VL-7B across Different Memory Budgets.

The results in Tab. 6 indicate that these summary tokens effectively preserve long-term memory, leading to improved performance on VideoMME."

            "content": "Streaming Video Understanding Existing MLLMs [4, 5, 12, 23] are primarily designed for pre-defined offline videos and struggle with continuous streaming videos. While some prior works have adapted existing offline MLLMs to online settings [46, 50, 51], they rely on costly model-specific training. Training-free streaming methods, such as ReKV [13] and LiveVLM [31], prefill offload KV cache to external devices. At user query time, they retrieve the full KV cache and reconstruct it on the GPU, incurring high latency and overall memory usage. In contrast, StreamMem [49] heuristically reuses KV cache, but lacks fine-grained KV cache management and interpretability. Unlike prior training-free methods, HERMES is grounded in systematic attention analysis with improved interpretability and reliability. KV Cache Compression for Video Input Numerous KV cache compression techniques have been proposed for offline video understanding [40, 42, 44, 48], but most of these methods are poorly suited for streaming scenarios due to the unpredictable future frames and user queries [8]. Existing online KV cache compression paradigms [8, 13, 31, 49] largely overlook the inherently hierarchical storage structure of the KV cache. HERMES addresses this gap by introducing hierarchical KV cache management strategy, which enables fine-grained memory utilization and low-latency responses. 10 Model Re-Indexing LLaVA-OV-7B + HERMES + HERMES - lazy eager StrBench Real-Time 71.34 72.63 72.30 OVO-Bench Real-Time Backward Avg. 63.06 65.07 64.91 43.64 48.80 47.21 53.35 56.94 56.06 Model Re-Indexing VideoMME Short Medium Long Avg.

            "title": "6 Conclusion",
            "content": "This paper proposes HERMES, training-free framework for efficient streaming video understanding. Guided by mechanistic attention analysis, we conceptualizes KV cache as hierarchical video memory system across multiple granularities. By introducing cross-layer memory smoothing and position re-indexing, HERMES further enhances the understanding performance for long streaming input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERMES delivers accurate performance under continuously growing video streams, while consistently maintaining extremely low response latency and compact GPU memory usage, making it well suited for real-world streaming deployment."

For the deep layers, since they primarily focus on frame-level global semantic information, we employ global guidance prompt as pseudo-query to extract attention weights of video tokens. In contrast, the middle layers lie in transition between recency-biased attention and global semantic focus. Therefore, we adopt hybrid guidance strategy, in which the local guidance prompt and the global guidance prompt are concatenated into single prompt string to jointly guide the token compression. Configuration of Cross-Layer Memory Smoothing Given that long-term memory tends to remain relatively stable, while short-term memory focuses on diverse perception, we set different 𝜆 for different layer stages: 𝜆𝑙 = 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, if 𝑙 ℒ𝑠 ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 if 𝑙 ℒ𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 if 𝑙 ℒ𝑑𝑒 𝑒 𝑝 (7) The ablation study Tab. 5 shows the effectiveness of this hyperparameter choice."

The Real-Time Visual Understanding subset is the most extensive component, featuring 2,500 questions across 500 videos. It covers 10 tasks, such as object perception and causal reasoning. In this paper, we focus on the Real-Time Visual Understanding subset for evaluation. OVO-Bench [25] evaluates the online reasoning and temporal awareness of MLLMs, featuring 644 videos with approximately 2,800 fine-grained multiple-choice QA pairs. It organizes 12 tasks into three distinct categories, which are real-time visual perception, backward tracing, and forward active responding.

RVS-Ego and RVS-Movie [53] are designed to evaluate the real-time understanding capabilities of models in online streaming scenarios. The datasets consist of 10 long ego-centric videos from the Ego4D dataset [17] and 22 long movie clips from the MovieNet dataset [20] dataset, totaling over 21 hours of video content. D.2 Offline Benchmarks MVBench [24] systematically evaluates the temporal understanding capabilities of MLLMs. It utilizes novel static-to-dynamic method to define 20 distinct temporal tasks, such as action sequence and moving direction, which cannot be effectively solved with single frame. The videos are collected from wide range of datasets, including NTU RGB+D [36], Perception [34], etc. Egoschema [30] is diagnostic benchmark designed to assess long-form video understanding abilities. Derived from Ego4D [17], it consists of over 5,000 human-curated multiple-choice QA pairs associated with egocentric video clips. VideoMME [16] is full-spectrum, multimodal benchmark designed for the comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs in video analysis. It comprises 900 manually curated videos spanning six primary domains and diverse durations to assess temporal adaptability. The dataset features 2,700 high-quality QA pairs that necessitate processing multimodal inputs, including video frames, subtitles, and audio. Details of Position Re-Indexing Inspired by StreamingVLMs strategy of managing positional stability in streaming scenarios [46], we adopt unified left-compaction re-indexing scheme to eliminate positional gaps introduced by KV-cache pruning while preserving the semantic anchoring of the system prompt. Concretely, system text tokens are kept fixed to provide stable textual anchor, whereas retained video tokens are re-indexed in left-compact manner and placed contiguously after the static prefix. To reuse cached key states without re-computation, we further apply delta-based rotary correction that compensates for the positional displacement. 28 E.1 Re-indexing for LLaVA-OV (1D RoPE) LLaVA-OV employs standard 1D RoPE, where each token is associated with scalar positional index 𝑝. Therefore, we perform left-compaction of the 1D indices: the system prefix positions remain unchanged, while the retained positions of video tokens are reassigned to form dense contiguous segment immediately following the fixed prefix. Let offset denote the length of the system prompt prefix tokens, and let 𝒫 = {𝑝0 < 𝑝1 < < 𝑝𝑁1} be the sorted set of retained video token positions (excluding the fixed prefix). For retained video token originally at position 𝑝old 𝒫, its compacted 1D position is defined as 𝑝new = offset + rank𝒫 ( ) . 𝑝old (8) This mapping removes gaps while preserving the original temporal ordering along the stream, and ensures that the video region occupies dense range directly after the static text region. To align cached key states with the updated positions, we avoid re-generating keys and instead apply rotary delta correction induced by the positional shift. For cached key vector kold associated with position 𝑝old and remapped to 𝑝new, we compute where the relative phase shift is knew = kold RotaryDelta ( 𝑝old, 𝑝new ) , RotaryDelta ( 𝑝old, 𝑝new ) = 𝑒 𝑖(𝑝new𝑝old)θ , (9) (10) and θ denotes the RoPE frequency vector. This update preserves the correctness of attention under the new indexing while enabling direct reuse of the cached KV states. E.2 Re-indexing for Qwen2.5-VL (3D M-RoPE) For Qwen2.5-VL, video tokens are indexed by 3D M-RoPE coordinate = (𝑝(𝑡), 𝑝(ℎ), 𝑝(𝑤)), covering temporal and spatial dimensions. After pruning, the retained video tokens typically occupy sparse coordinates along each dimension 𝑑 {𝑡, ℎ, 𝑤}. To eliminate the gaps without disturbing the monotonic ordering, we apply dimension-wise left-compaction independently along each axis, while keeping the system token prefix fixed. Let 𝒫 (𝑑) = {𝑝(𝑑) 0 < 𝑝(𝑑) 1 < < 𝑝(𝑑) 𝑁𝑑1 } denote the sorted set of retained coordinates along dimension 𝑑. For token originally located at 𝑝(𝑑) its compacted coordinate is defined by its rank within 𝒫 (𝑑) , shifted by the fixed prefix offset: ) ( old 𝑝(𝑑) new = offset + rank𝒫 (𝑑) 𝑝(𝑑) old , 𝑑 {𝑡, ℎ, 𝑤}. 𝒫 (𝑑) , (11) This procedure yields dense and contiguous (𝑡, ℎ, 𝑤) grid for the video tokens placed immediately after the static text region, thereby ensuring positional continuity while preserving the distinct semantic roles of temporal and spatial indices. As in the 1D case, we reuse cached keys by applying M-RoPE correction. Given key kold associated with pold = (𝑝(𝑡) old , 𝑝(ℎ) old , 𝑝(𝑤) old ) and remapped to the corrected key is obtained as with the relative phase shift: pnew = (𝑝(𝑡) new, 𝑝(ℎ) new, 𝑝(𝑤) new), knew = kold RotaryDelta(pold, pnew) , RotaryDelta(pold, pnew) = Concat 𝑑{𝑡,ℎ,𝑤} ( 𝑒 𝑖(𝑝(𝑑) new𝑝(𝑑) old ) , )θ(𝑑) (12) (13) where Concat denotes the concatenation operation along the channel dimension, and θ(𝑑) rotary frequency vector corresponding to the channel section allocated for dimension 𝑑. represents the"
