If what you say is true, Im going to run away from the book and go my own way. Sophies World, by Jostein Gaarder. Characters in fictional works, once established, should take on life of their own, beyond the manipulation of their authors. Bringing fictional characters and worlds into life has long captivated the imagination of fiction enthusiasts. Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 8 3 5 4 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation can now craft interactive artificial society for characters in books through multi-agent systems (Park et al., 2023), which simulate social interactions of humans and hence facilitate diverse applications such as interactive games (Wu et al., 2024), social simulations (Zhou et al., 2023) and story creation (Han et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024). Previous efforts primarily focus on creating agent societies from scratch, where agent personas are newly defined by brief descriptions or demographic traits, including: 1) social simulations that study agents social behaviors, ranging from specified scenarios such as debates (Chan et al., 2023) and strategic games (Wang et al., 2023a) to open-ended society simulation (Park et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2024); and 2) task-oriented multi-agent systems, such as collaborative coding (Huang et al., 2023) and story generation (Han et al., 2024), where agents are specialized for different subtasks. However, agent societies simulating established fictional worlds remain underexplored. In this work, we propose BookWorld, comprehensive system for book-based multi-agent societies, which simulates story progression in fictional worlds and facilitates story creation. BookWorld extracts character data and background knowledge from source books, and constructs multi-agent system using these data, comprising role agents for the characters and world agent for simulation control. The simulation progresses through individual scenes, where role agents of involved characters engage in various interactions such as working, communicating and trading. They continuously update their memories, status, and goals. The world agent orchestrates the simulation by managing system workflow, maintaining global status, providing environmental feedback, e.t.c.When the simulation ends, its histories weave together the stories, which are then polished by LLMs into cohesive, novelstyle narratives. Our system also supports human intervention, i.e., controlling the simulation via user-specified plots or scripts. In addition, we systematically collect worldview data from books to enhance fictional world simulation. As fictional works often contain various fantastical background elements, we extract comprehensive worldview data to enrich BookWorld, including social norms, cultural contexts, and terminology explanations. These data enable agents in BookWorld to act appropriately under corresponding worldviews. The main contributions of this work are as follows: To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first study of book-based agent societies for fictional world simulation. Such simulation allows character-driven storytelling, thus facilitating creative story generation. We introduce BookWorld, comprehensive framework for constructing and simulating bookbased agent societies, covering systematic methodologies for data preparation, simulation, and rephrasing. We evaluate BookWorld through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. The results demonstrate that BookWorld generates high-quality narratives while maintaining fidelity to the source materials, outperforming previous methods in 75.36% cases. 2. Related Work 2.1. Multi-agent System World Simulation Multi-agent systems for world simulation are developed to explore social dynamics in real-world applications. Such simulations could test social science theories within small scope (Chuang et al., 2024) or populate virtual spaces and communities with large-scale realistic social phenomena. 2 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Figure 2: The complete pipeline of BookWorld simulation. The framework starts from initializing the agents, then the agents interact across scenes. Park et al. (2023) develops generative agents within Sims-like interactive sandbox environment, enabling users to engage with small community of 25 agents through natural language interactions. Project Sid (AL et al., 2024) deploys nearly thousand agents with distinct personalities in Minecraft, establishing an \"AI civilization\" with complex human social activities such as trading and elections. Yang et al. (2024) develops OASIS, large-scale social media simulation framework capable of orchestrating interactions among millions of agents. Story Generation Some works have made the efforts to leverage multi-agent systems for story generation (Chen et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024). In these works, stories are generated by writing and expanding pre-defined outlines through constructing author (or director), editor, and actor agents to collaboratively solve the story generation task. While these works demonstrate significant potential in world simulations and story generation, there remains limited exploration of book-based virtual environment construction and its application to story creation. 2.2. Automated Story Writing Early research methods emphasize algorithm planning based on character traits and social constraints (Meehan, 1977; Lebowitz, 1984). With the rise of neural networks, research has gradually shifted towards data-driven machine learning methods (Yao et al., 2019; Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2020; Kreminski et al., 2021), combining or sifting stories. The advent of large language models has significantly transformed the landscape of automated story writing (Yuan et al., 2022). Most contemporary approaches employ top-down methodology, generating narratives from the perspective of the writer or director, first creating high-level story 3 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation outlines and then incrementally developing detailed content to enhance the overall quality of the narrative generation. While some approaches rely on single large language model (Mirowski et al., 2023), others leverage multi-agent architectures to generate stories (Han et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024). However, experimental results show that these approaches still lag behind human professional writers in intrinsic creativity and textual complexity (Tian et al., 2024), often generating stories that lack suspense and tension and tend to produce homogenized, creatively lacking content (GómezRodríguez and Williams, 2023; Ismayilzada et al., 2024). 3. BookWorld In this section, we elaborate on the design of BookWorld. The primary motive of BookWorld is to build an interactive system for book-based multi-agent simulation, which includes two major objectives: Providing immersive experiences where character agents (and users) feel as if they are situated in the fictional world; Enhancing character autonomy within the system while preserving fidelity to their established personality and experiences. Towards these objectives, we concentrate on the design principles of data and agents. The original text is transformed into structured data through well-designed extraction method, which filters out the key information used to build the agents. In addition, we innovatively develop specialized method to collect worldview details, ensuring adherence to global norms in fictional worldviews. In BookWorld. the character agents are granted substantial autonomy. Their actions include exploring the environment, interacting with other characters, and responding to various stimuli. dynamic attributes updating mechanism allows them to reflect on their experiences throughout simulations, all while preserving character fidelity and consistency. 3.1. Overview The overall simulation pipeline is illustrated in Figure 2. Data Preparation Before the simulation starts, we extract character and worldview data from source materials, used for book-to-system construction. The extraction method is detailed in 3.4. Simulation The simulation begins by initializing role agents and the world agent, loading character profiles, the geospatial map, the worldview data and other necessary information. Each character establishes long-term motivations representing fundamental aspirations, such as defending my country. Details about the agents are introduced in 3.2. Upon completing initialization, the simulation phase commences. Referring to dramatic theory (McKee, 1999), we define the minimal narrative unit as scene to preserve narrative integrity and coherence. scene is bounded segment, analogous to chapter in novels. The simulation continues for user-specified number of scenes. Scenes retain modular independence, and they collectively compose an integral, cohesive narrative. Within each scene, group of selected role agents act one after another. They execute actions, 4 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation interact with other agents or the environment, driven by their personal goals. Detailed scene arrangements are described in 3.3. BookWorld incorporates comprehensive geospatial modeling, where the system tracks and updates role agents locations dynamically. As characters navigate through the fictional world, their movements are governed by geographical constraints and travel times. When agents decide to travel, they must spend several scenes in transit before reaching their destinations. This process is orchestrated by the world agent, which also select scene participants based on their current whereabouts and historical interactions. Rephrasing After the simulation ends, we collect the simulation records and apply LLMs to rephrase the records into the final, novel-style story. 3.2. Architecture Our approach empowers characters to act within spatially and culturally grounded virtual world, enabling stories to emerge naturally from their interactions. To achieve this, we introduce two core components: role agents and world agent. These components are designed to work together, bridging individual character motivations with global environmental constraints, thereby ensuring both narrative creativity and logical coherence. 3.2.1. Role Agents Role agents are the core of BookWorld. They are able to make actions based on their intrinsic traits and exhibit complex social behaviors, forming individual motivations and memories during the simulation. Those agents are equipped with long-term memory module based on retrieval augmentation. Attributes Role attributes contain fundamental traits essential for agent construction. These attributes are categorized into static and dynamic types: Static Attributes Static attributes include inherent characteristics such as gender, age, appearance, and personality. These attributes, specified in character profiles, remain constant throughout the simulation to maintain character consistency. Dynamic Attributes Dynamic attributes mainly include goals, states and memories. Initialized at the beginning, these attributes evolve with story progression, enabling dynamic character development. Actions Character actions constitute the majority of story progression. Instead of relying on fixed action space, our system utilizes natural language to describe action details, enabling open-domain behaviors. Actions are either proactive or reactive. During their turn as an initiator, characters proactively plan and execute actions based on their goals, states, and information about others. When designated as action targets, characters should respond accordingly."

            "content": "targets: 5 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Figure 3: An example of role action 𝑑𝑖. Thoughts are enclosed in [ ]. Actions are enclosed in ( ). The characters dialogue is presented without any framing. Character Interaction Initiators can engage with characters either individually or in groups. Accessible characters include main characters and non-player characters (NPCs). NPCs, such as street vendors, are characters that are not assigned specific role agents. When an NPC is approached, the system creates temporary, memoryless NPC agent to manage the interaction. Environmental Interaction Initiators can perform actions involving the environment to gather information or complete tasks, such as investigating the surrounding area. No Interaction If not specifying target for interaction, initiators can engage in solitary activities, such as reading. Memory To support long-term simulation, we design long and short-term memory mechanism following generative agents (Park et al., 2023). Short-Term Memory (STM) STM stores recent events and complete dialogue details ..., 𝑑𝑖1, 𝑑𝑖 up to capacity limit, allowing for immediate responses in current scenarios. Long-Term Memory (LTM) LTM stores condensed summaries of memories exceeding the STM limit. When STM reaches capacity, older memories are abstracted to LTM (e.g. 𝑚𝑖 = summarize(𝑑𝑖)) and stored, available for retrieval when needed. 3.2.2. World Agent The world agent serves as an indispensable component of this system, handling all tasks beyond character-to-character interactions, including environmental management and story outline processing. Attributes The world agent primarily requires basic worldview. It refers to fundamental description of the virtual world, encompassing its primary characteristics and core settings. This overview provides agents with basic framework for rapid comprehension of the worlds essential features. Actions The world agent maintains the virtual environment and primarily responds to actions taken by character agents. Its functionalities include: Environmental Responses When character agents interact with the environment, the world agent generates outcomes based on the worldview settings and relevant information of the current location. For example, if character attempts to break through door, the action is more likely to succeed in common village setting but may fail in heavily guarded castle. Event Generation and Updates The world agent manages global events within the system. While stories are driven by conflicts, role agents operating without guidance may lose clear goals and exhibit repetitive behaviors. Therefore, generating stimulating events significantly BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation enhances the storys appeal. When event stimulation is required by user settings, the World Agent generates conflict-rich events based on background settings and updates them according to the characters real-time actions. 3.2.3. Map BookWorld implements discrete map to introduce spatial relationships in the environment. The map equips natural language descriptions for key locations and weighted undirected graph for distances between locations. Location Profiles Each location has unique name, brief description (appearance, atmosphere, history), and optional detailed information (local customs, special items). Distance Network Distances between locations are represented through weighted undirected graph. Characters can move between adjacent locations or traverse longer paths by consuming specified time units. In BookWorld we specify one scene as time unit. 3.3. Simulation Implementation Scene and Settlement Prior to each scenes commencement, the world agent selects participating characters who must share common location, ensuring narrative focus and interaction coherence. Each scene comprises multiple rounds, where characters have several action opportunities as the initiator. Rather than following fixed sequence, the world agent dynamically determines the initiator based on character states, and narrative development requirements. During his/her round, the initiator makes the plan and action based on his/her objective and current situation. The available action types are explained in 3.2.1. The system evaluates scene completion through the action records. Upon scene conclusion, characters may opt to move to another location. The world agent updates current events based on recent developments, and in script mode, provides guidance for the next narrative phase. Movement calculations are performed for traveling characters, with those completing their designated travel rounds arriving at their destinations. Controllable Story Generating Based on practical requirements, users may wish to either observe characters spontaneous actions or maintain direct control over the storyline. To accommodate these diverse needs, this system implements two operational modes with distinct feedback mechanisms: Free Mode and Script Mode. Script Mode incorporates user-defined scripts to guide character actions, generating detailed behaviors while adhering to the script outline. At the start of the simulation, the system split given 𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑡 into critical acts 𝑎𝑐𝑡1, 𝑎𝑐𝑡2, . . .. Within the simulation, the system checks the progress and makes instructions to role agents based on current 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖, maintaining the narrative consistency with each session. In Free Mode, characters have complete autonomy, acting based on their established settings and characteristics. Users can also set initial incidents, enhancing the drama and characters engagement. Events update in real-time with simulation progress. 7 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Figure 4: The procedure of building worldview data. We extract atomic facts from each chunk, then filter, cluster and summarize them to construct the final dataset. 3.4. Data Preparation General Information Extraction We provide an automatic extraction method based on incremental updating inspired by Yuan et al. (2024). The original text is first segmented into chunks. Target characters are allocated with an initial profile. Then, we traverse through chunks and recursively update the character information, including character profiles and relationships with others. This information is finally organized into structured data used for agent construction. We conduct information extraction from six Chinese works and ten English works, producing total of 453 presets. The presets mainly include the outline and the information about the present characters of certain act in the book. Enriching BookWorld with Worldview Data Novels, especially fictions, often contain implicit, unstructured knowledge that is not presented in uniform format but can be inferred from the context (Wang et al., 2023b). For instance, in the world of Harry Potter, ordinary people should be unaware of the existence of wizards. Any violations of established settings during the simulation would disrupt the narrative immersion of the experience. Therefore, comprehensive database of the target works worldview elements is essential. We propose term-based extraction method to consolidate related settings. During simulation, these settings are incorporated into the prompts as references if certain terms are mentioned or the context is strongly related to specific settings, thereby enhancing the environmental immersion and maintaining consistent world-building throughout the simulation. Each extracted setting contains four attributes: Term: The object of description (e.g., Invisibility Cloak, White Walkers). Terms may be empty strings when describing general social atmospheres or universal facts within the fictional world. Nature: The category of the setting. This might include artifact, social norm. Detail: Comprehensive textual description of the setting. For specific term, the detail describes its characteristics. Source: The chapter where the setting is extracted, enabling distinction between different timelines within the work. We extract information in four steps. The procedure is illustrated in Figure 4. First, we segment chapters into manageable chunks for processing. Next, we analyze each chunk to extract relevant worldview knowledge by equipping LLMs to identify elements in the chunk as well as their natures and 8 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Model Method with script An.

Then, we filter these elements to remove character actions and common-sense information that could hinder the simulation. Finally, we cluster and consolidate similar records, eliminating redundancy while retaining crucial details. Each element is tagged with its source chapter, facilitating both verification and timeline control in subsequent applications. We have collected 9912 settings from the same source materials mentioned above, 44.8% in Chinese and 55.2% in English. Details about extracted settings are presented in Appendix B. 4. Experiments In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of BookWorld via story generation. We focus on the quality of the generated stories and conduct extensive experiments. 4.1. Evaluation Metrics Since giving concrete score for story is quite difficult task even for human evaluators, we adopt pairwise comparison across multiple dimensions between the stories generated by different methods following previous work (Chen et al., 2024). Within this framework, outputs from any two methods undergo paired comparison, with LLMs determining superior performance. We demonstrate the credibility of this method by comparing it with human evaluation A. We conduct experiments and evaluations for two scenarios: story generation with given outline and without an outline. The two scenarios require different evaluation dimensions. For the former, we assess Storyline Quality (SQ.), which measures the systems adherence to the given outline. For the latter, we calculate Creativity (Cr.), evaluating whether the system can produce innovative and refreshing new stories. Additionally, there are four general evaluation metrics that apply generally to both scenarios, making total of five metrics assessed in each type of experiment: Anthropomorphism (An): The effectiveness of attributing human characteristics to non-human entities while preserving their original nature. 9 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Character Fidelity (CF): The consistency of characters behaviors and actions with their established traits and backgrounds. Immersion and Setting (IS): The ability to create convincing and engaging story world through environmental and atmospheric details. Writing Quality (WQ): The technical execution of writing mechanics and style that serves the narrative. 4.2. Experiment Setup Baselines We compare stories generated via three methods: 1) Direct generation, which directly prompts LLMs with all the processed book data, 2) HoLLMwood (Chen et al., 2024), utilizes LLMs to replicate the human story-writing process. The writer agent refines and breaks down the outline based on the editor agents feedback, while the actor agents adopt character roles to flesh out the story. and 3) BookWorld. Models For simulation, we adopt both open-sourced models and close-sourced models as the base model for role agents and the world agent. During the experiments, we keep the number of dialogue turns consistent across methods. Each experiment simulates 2 to 4 scenes, averaging total of 4,230 words. The final results are evaluated using gpt-4o-2024-08-06. 4.3. Evaluation Results Table 1 illustrates the win rates of BookWorld against two baseline methods across five evaluation metrics. BookWorld consistently outperforms the direct generation baseline across all evaluated metrics and models, with particularly strong performance in Immersion. Against HoLLMwood, while BookWorld retains superiority in Immersion and Character Fidelity, it faces challenges in Storyline Quality and Writing Quality. On most models, BookWorld demonstrates significant advantages over baseline approaches. However, when using Llama-3.3-70B, BookWorld underperforms direct generation and HW in certain dimensions. This performance gap can be attributed to two factors. First, multi-agent simulation is inherently more complex than direct generation, requiring advanced capabilities in handling structured outputs and following complicated instructions. Second, our experiments partially involve Chinese data, which is not an advantage of Llama-3.3-70B. 4.4. Ablation Study We conducted an ablation study and comparative analysis on the primary features of BookWorld. Using gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 as the base model for the agents, adopting same presets with 4.3, we compared the output quality of BookWorld with and without specific features enabled, calculating the win rate for each dimension. The final results are presented in the Table 2. The results are basically in line with expectations. Removing environmental output significantly affect the sense of immersion, which in turn reduced writing quality, but it did not have much impact on the quality of the storyline. On the other hand, disabling the Scene mode results in decline in quality across all dimensions, with the most significant impact on the storyline. 10 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Function An.

Discussion We display some interesting examples of BookWorld outputs in Table 3. In most cases, BookWorld can process information correctly, yielding appropriate results when the agents interact with the environment and initiate interactions. The system has the capability to maintain and utilize long-term memories and states. We also demonstrated the impact of introducing worldview settings. Prior to incorporating these settings, the model generated environment responses based on real-world common sense, leading to descriptions such as moonlight and silver, which are inconsistent with the worldview of Solaris. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we presented BookWorld, comprehensive system that transforms static literary works into dynamic, interactive environments. Our approach differs from previous work by focusing specifically on reproducing the unique worldviews, geographical settings, and interpersonal dynamics that make these literary works compelling. Experiment results show that BookWorld successfully creates high-quality narratives by building immersive book-based societies. Our approach demonstrates high scalability and broad applicability across various scenarios. We hope this research will further advance the development of multi-agent technologies and character simulation techniques."

            "content": "To prioritize generalizability and openness, BookWorld adopts highly simplified representation of interactive environments. This trade-off leads to reduced performance compared to systems specifically designed for particular works or scenarios. For example, it is nearly impossible to complete full game of Werewolf (a social deduction game) in BookWorld. Additionally, current research in role-playing technology predominantly focuses on one-on-one chat between users and characters, with limited attention to characters decision-making processes in realistic environments. This research gap results in characters exhibiting indecisive behaviors when faced with complex situations. Addressing this limitation requires further advancement in role-playing technology, particularly in enhancing characters capabilities in complex, multi-agent scenarios. 11 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Enviroment and NPC Responses Type World Agent Enviroment (Characters broke the seal) As they stood transfixed, the mist before them slowly parted like ethereal curtain, unveiling sight that stole their breath away.

Consistency with Human Evaluation To validate the reliability of our model-based evaluation approach, we conduct comprehensive agreement analysis between model assessments and human assessments. We recruit 5 human annotators (Fans of the corresponding work) to evaluate the outputs from our proposed method and the baseline approach across five dimensions. For each comparison, both human annotators and our model are asked to indicate which method performs better on each dimension. To ensure evaluation quality, we randomly sample pairs of outputs from both methods for assessment. To quantify the agreement between model and human judgments, we employ Cohens Kappa coefficient (𝜅), metric for measuring inter-rater reliability while accounting for chance agreement. An. SQ. 𝜅 0.786 0.688 0.637 0.781 0.731 WQ. CF. IS. Table 4: The Cohens Kappa between human evaluation and model evaluation. The Cohens Kappa coefficients between our models judgments and human evaluations are presented in Table 4. The results indicate that there is high level of consistency between human evaluation and machine evaluation, and the results of machine evaluation are sufficient to reflect the actual effectiveness of the method.

The practice of placing altars for deities beside altars for the God of monotheistic faiths, indicating clash of religious beliefs.\", \"A raised structure used for offerings and sacrifices, often associated with worship and remembrance of divine encounters. Bellerophon is figure representing the consequences of hubris, as he attempted to ascend to heaven but faced dire repercussions for his ambition. monumental bridge is constructed over the Abyss, symbolizing the connection between Hell and the earthly realm, allowing for the passage of entities between these worlds. The highest and most divine part of the universe, often associated with the presence of the divine and ultimate reality. The presentation of the first harvest to the divine is sacred act, symbolizing gratitude and the acknowledgment of higher powers role in agriculture.

Retrieval Augmented Role-Playing Agent The construction of role agents aims to optimize the output 𝑎 of query 𝑞 directed to the agent 𝐴(𝑅, 𝑀 ), where 𝑅 refers to character information and 𝑀 means base model. In this research, we follow the method introduced in ChatHaruhi (Li et al., 2023). This involves leveraging three key sources: Character Profile (𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓 𝑖𝑙𝑒) concise description of the character, including their appearance, personality traits, and background. Due to its brevity, the entire profile can be retained and included in the models input without modification. Original Text Excerpts (𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡) set of character-related excerpts from the source material, typically represented as list {𝑡1, 𝑡2, . . . , 𝑡𝑛} (e.g., all the dialogues of certain character in the original work). The total volume of text is often too large to be fully input into the model. 16 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Historical Records (𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑦) As the simulation progresses, character agents continuously generate new action records {𝑚1, 𝑚2, . . . , 𝑚𝑘}. For 𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑦 and 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡, vector similarity-based retrieval method is employed to identify the top 𝑘 relevant records. The retrieval mechanisms are similar. Consider the retrieval of 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡, each excerpt 𝑡𝑖 is encoded into fixed-length vector 𝑣𝑖 using pre-trained text embedding model, and the vectors are stored in vector database. When query 𝑞 is issued, it is similarly transformed into vector representation 𝑣𝑞 using the same embedding model. The similarity between 𝑞 and each text excerpt 𝑡𝑖 is then computed using the cosine similarity metric: similarity(𝑞, 𝑡𝑖) = cos(𝑣𝑞, 𝑣𝑖) = 𝑣𝑞 𝑣𝑖 𝑣𝑞𝑣𝑖 . Based on the computed similarity scores, the top 𝑘 most similar excerpts are selected as references for role-playing: {𝑡𝑖1, 𝑡𝑖2, . . . , 𝑡𝑖𝑘 } = argmax 𝑖{1,2,...,𝑁 } similarity(𝑞, 𝑣𝑖). The final prompt for the role-playing agent consists of four components: the systems role-playing instructions, the 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓 𝑖𝑙𝑒, the retrieved memory {𝑚𝑖1, 𝑚𝑖2, . . . , 𝑚𝑖𝑘 }, and the retrieved text excerpts {𝑡𝑖1, 𝑡𝑖2, . . . , 𝑡𝑖𝑘 }. This prompt is then fed into the language model 𝑀 , which generates the response 𝑎 for the given query 𝑞. D. Prompts We provide the details of the prompt templates of BookWorld in this section. BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Role Agent Prompt for Planning You are {role_name}. Your nickname is {nickname}. Based on your goal and other provided information, you need to take the next action. ## Action History {history} ## Your profile {profile} {world_description} ## Your goal {goal} ## Your status {status} ## Other characters with you; currently, you can only interact with them {other_roles_info} ## Roleplaying Requirements 1. **Output Format:** Your output, \"detail,\" can include **thoughts**, **speech**, or **actions**, each occurring 0 to 1 time. Use [] to indicate thoughts, which are invisible to others. Use () to indicate actions, such as (silence) or (smile), which are visible to others. Speech needs no indication and is visible to others. - Note that **actions** must use your third-person form, nickname, as the subject. - For speech, refer to the speaking habits outlined in: references. 2. **Roleplay {nickname}:** Imitate his/her language, personality, emotions, thought processes, and behavior. Plan your responses based on their identity, background, and knowledge. Exhibit appropriate emotions and incorporate subtext and emotional depth. Strive to act like realistic, emotionally rich person. The dialogue should be engaging, advance the plot, and reveal the characters emotions, intentions, or conflicts. Maintain natural flow in conversations; for instance, if the prior dialogue involves another character, **avoid repeating that characters name**. - You may reference the relevant world-building context: knowledges. 3. **Concise Output:** Each paragraph of thoughts, speech, or actions should typically not exceed 40 words. 4. **Substance:** Ensure your responses are meaningful, create tension, resolve issues, or introduce dramatic twists. 5. **Avoid Repetition:** Avoid repeating information from the dialogue history, and refrain from vague or generic responses. Do not prepare, ask for opinions, or confirm; instead, act immediately and draw conclusions. Return the response following JSON format. It should be parsable using eval(). **Dont include json**. Avoid using single quotes for keys and values, use double quotes. Output Fields: action: Represents the action, expressed as single verb. interact_type: role, environment, npc, or no. Indicates the interaction target of your action. - role: Specifies interaction with one or more characters. - If single, you are interacting with single character (e.g., action: dialogue). - If multi, you are interacting with multiple characters. - environment: Indicates interaction with the environment (e.g., action: investigate, destroy). - npc: Refers to interaction with non-character in the list (e.g., action: shop). - no: Indicates no interaction is required. target_role_codes: list of str. If interact_type is single or multi, it represents the list of target character codes, e.g., [\"John-zh\", \"Sam-zh\"]. For single, this list should have exactly one element. target_npc_name: str. If interact_type is npc, this represents the target NPC name, e.g., \"shopkeeper.\" visible_role_codes: list of str. You can limit the visibility of your action details to specific group members. This list should include target_role_codes. detail: str. literary narrative statement containing your thoughts, speech, and actions. Table 7: Planning prompt for role agent. 18 BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation World Agent Prompt for Environmental Interaction You are an Enviroment model, responsible for generating environmental information. Character {role_name} is attempting to take action {action} at {location}. Based on the following information, generate literary description that details the process and outcome of the action, including environmental details and emotional nuances, as if from narrative novel. Avoid using any system prompts or mechanical language. Return string. ## Action Details {action_detail} ## Location Details {location_description} ## Worldview Details {world_description} ## Additional Information {references} ## Response Requirements 1. The action may fail, but avoid making the action ineffective. Try to provide new clues or environmental descriptions. 2. Use third-person perspective. 3. Keep the output concise, within 100 words. You serve as the Enviroment model, responding to the characters current action, not performing any actions for the character. 4. The output should not include the original text from the action detail but should seamlessly follow the action details, maintaining the flow of the plot.
