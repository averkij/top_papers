While agent\ncapabilities are increasingly demonstrated on controlled bench-\nmarks [19, 29, 49], the benchmark scores alone do not reveal how\nagents’ queries evolve across steps, or how retrieved context shapes\nsubsequent queries.",
            "content": "The aforementioned questions matter for practical system design. Agents may waste retrieval budget through repetitive or overly narrow reformulations, fail to explore alternative facets, or under-use evidence accumulated across steps. Understanding session structure can inform query-policy control, and quantifying evidence reuse can guide budget allocation and evaluation design. As agents consume results programmatically, leaving no observable trace of what they found useful, the logs lack implicit feedback signals (e.g., direct clicks) that anchor traditional behavioral inference. This creates measurement gap. We can observe sequences of queries and retrieved evidence, but it remains unclear how sessions unfold, how behavior differs by intent, what reformulation moves dominate, and whether agents incorporate evidence from earlier steps. SIGIR 26, July 2024, 2026, Melbourne Naarm, Australia Ning et al. We provide practical design takeaways from the logs, including repetition-aware stopping, intent-adaptive retrieval budgeting, and cross-step context tracking. We plan to release an anonymized version of the logs to support reproducibility (details in Section 3)."

            "content": "Human Search Behavior and Log Analysis: Large-scale query logs have long been used to study search behavior in the wild [8, 16, 41], offering scalable, behavior-grounded signals for characterizing session dynamics and query reformulation beyond what offline benchmarks capture. core theme is within-session learning. Eickhoff et al. [10] trace how newly introduced terms relate to evidence observed before reformulation (e.g., SERP snippets and visited pages), alongside complementary work on interpreting implicit feedback such as clicks and dwell time [1, 12, 20]. Exploratory search and navigation studies further document differences in branching and interaction patterns across users and information needs [28, 43, 48], while sessionization analyses examine how sessions begin and end in practice [21]. We adopt this evidence-traceability perspective for autonomous agents and operationalize it using retrieved evidence text, enabling systematic comparisons of agent behaviors across intents and guiding design choices such as retrieval budgeting and cross-step context management. While small line of work compares humans and agents directly [46, 47, 56], these comparisons are often task-specific or simulation-based, motivating complementary large-scale log analyses of how autonomous agents search across sessions in the wild. LLM Interaction Platforms and Usage Logs: Recent efforts analyze large-scale interaction data from LLM systems and evaluation platforms. Chatbot Arena (LMSYS LLM Arena) aggregates pairwise preference votes [6], and LMSYS-Chat-1M releases one million multi-model conversations collected in the wild [55]. OpenAI reports how people use ChatGPT at scale [33], and Anthropic presents privacy-preserving analyses of millions of Claude conversations to characterize economic task usage [14]. SciArena extends the Arena protocol to scientific literature-grounded tasks and provides corresponding benchmark [53]. These works capture usage and preference signals, but typically do not expose tool-level retrieval traces (queries, evidence, step-wise search decisions) needed to study agentic search behavior and within-session evidence reuse. Agentic Search Modeling, Benchmarks, and Infrastructures: Recent systems enabling LLMs to plan multi-step interactions with retrieval tools have shifted IR toward agentic workflows [2, 30, 40, 51]. Benchmarks for tool-using agents include WebShop [50], WebArena [57], AgentBench [27], and large-scale tool-use evaluation such as ToolLLM/ToolBench [37]. DeepResearchGym (DRGym) provides an open-source sandbox with reproducible search API and evaluation protocol for deep research systems [7]. Early analyses have begun to formalize agent behaviors. Jin et al. [19] link beneficial reasoning patterns to gains on GAIA [29] and WebWalker [49]; complementary efforts propose taxonomies and risk frameworks, such as ST-WebAgentBench [24] and the Agentic AI Security Scoping Matrix [5]. However, benchmark scores alone provide limited visibility into how agents search in practice, and prior humanagent Figure 1: Intenttrajectory structure of agentic search logs. To address this gap, we analyze agentic search at two complementary levels: what the agent is trying to accomplish in session (session-level intent), and how the agent pursues that goal through step-wise search actions (trajectory-level query reformulation). Figure 1 illustrates this structure on short example session. To operationalize these levels, we develop measurement framework with three components: (1) LLM-based annotation pipelines that assign interpretable intent and trajectory labels to sessions and step-pairs following standard taxonomies; (2) offline replay of logged queries to reconstruct the retrieved evidence available at each step; and (3) Context-driven Term Adoption Rate (CTAR), metric we introduce to quantify whether newly introduced query terms can be lexically traced to retrieved evidence, including contributions from steps beyond the most recent retrieval. We apply this framework to logs collected from DeepResearchGym (DRGym) [7], i.e. research-oriented reproducible search API accessed by external agentic clients. With permission from the DRGym organizers, we study 14.44M logged search requests spanning six months, which we sessionize into 3.97M sessions. This provides an at-scale view of autonomous agents operating in the wild under shared retrieval backend. Our results answer the practical questions raised above about budget waste, reformulation behavior, and evidence reuse in multistep agentic search. We find that over 90% of multi-turn sessions contain at most ten steps, and 89% of inter-step intervals fall under one minute. Retrieval depth (i.e. the number of documents requested per query) is largely static, suggesting agents treat it as fixed parameter rather than adapting within sessions. Behavior also varies by intent. Fact-seeking sessions exhibit the highest repetition, which increases over time, indicating that agents can enter near-duplicate loops when retrieval is unproductive, while sessions requiring reasoning sustain broader exploration throughout. We also find that agents frequently incorporate terms from previously retrieved evidence, with measurable contributions from earlier steps beyond the most recent retrieval. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We provide large-scale behavioral characterization of agentic search from reproducible search infrastructure (14.44M search requests, 3.97M sessions), offering an at-scale view of autonomous agents operating in the wild. We introduce CTAR, metric for quantifying evidence-conditioned query evolution, and use it to demonstrate cross-step evidence reuse beyond the most recent retrieval.

The API is model-\nagnostic; although logs do not record the underlying agent im-\nplementation, requests originate from independent client systems\noperating under the same retrieval infrastructure.",
            "content": "The backend performs dense retrieval [17, 22] over two largescale English corpora, ClueWeb22-A-EN [34] and FineWeb [35]. The DRGym paper describes retrieval API with /search endpoint for ranked retrieval [7]. Operating over static web snapshots (instead of changing live index) enables re-issuing queries under fixed corpora for consistent retrieval behavior across experiments. Consistent with this design, each log entry records the timestamped query and request parameters  (Table 1)  , including retrieval depth and an ANN search-budget parameter [17]. For privacy, IP addresses are anonymized and used only for coarse client-level aggregation (grouping, sessionization, and country-level reporting), never for user identification or fine-grained geolocation. Scale and Coverage: The logs span 2025-06 to 2025-12 and contain 14.44 million requests. After preprocessing and sessionization (Section 3.2), we obtain 3.97M sessions. Requests originate from 558 anonymized client IPs across 25 countries. Figure 2a shows the geographic coverage, with the largest shares from China and the United States, followed by Hong Kong and Iceland. Overall traffic is substantial, peaking at 2.49 million requests in single week. Semantic Diversity: Figure 2b plots the pairwise cosine-similarity distribution for 100k randomly sampled queries using Qwen3Embedding-0.6B [52]. The distribution (mean=0.12) lies close to Table 1: Fields recorded in the search_logs table. Field Description id ip_address query_text num_of_docs complexity dataset timestamp Auto-incremented unique identifier for each request. Client IP address (anonymized for analysis). Query string submitted to the API. Number of documents requested for retrieval. ANN retrieval complexity controlling search budget. Corpus used for retrieval (ClueWeb22 or FineWeb). Timestamp of the logged request. the random-vector baseline (mean0 for uniformly distributed vectors), indicating that queries are semantically diverse rather than clustered around repeated themes. The slight rightward shift likely reflects shared information-seeking phrasing, not semantic redundancy. For reference, Qwen3 uses cosine similarity > 0.7 to mark semantically related pairs during training [52]. Query-Level Repetition: Figure 2c shows long-tailed query frequency distribution. Most distinct queries are quite rare, while only small set of queries repeats often. In particular, 53.89% of distinct queries occur at most three times, including 38.38% singleton queries, and the top-10 and top-100 most frequent queries account for only 0.59% and 1.51% of all requests, respectively. Taken together, the broad geographic coverage, low average semantic similarity, and long-tailed frequency spectrum suggest that the DRGym stream reflects realistic and diverse mix of information needs, rather than narrow set of repeatedly executed prompts. To further validate that this diversity is not an artifact of surfacelevel paraphrasing of popular benchmarks, we next quantify the overlap between logged queries and public benchmarks. We measure semantic overlap between log queries and four commonly used agentic benchmarks: GAIA [29], FRAMES [23], HLE [36], and WebWalkerQA [49]. We consider sample of 1 million queries from the logs, and encode all benchmark queries using Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B. Then, we count log queries exceeding cosine similarity threshold of 0.7 to any benchmark query. As shown in Table 2, benchmark-similar queries constitute less than 0.4% of the sample across all four benchmarks combined. Overlap is lowest for GAIA, and highest for WebWalker, whose web traversal queries more closely resemble natural search formulations. Overall, these results suggest the logs reflect diverse open-ended usage rather than concentrated benchmark execution. SIGIR 26, July 2024, 2026, Melbourne Naarm, Australia Ning et al.

Prior to release, we will remove direct identifiers (e.g., IP addresses) and apply standard PII scrubbing on free-text fields, releasing only the fields needed to reproduce our analyses with anonymized session IDs. This release has already received formal approval from the DRGym organizers. We will document the anonymization procedure and residual risks in the dataset card, following prior largescale LLM interaction log releases and privacy-preserving analyses [14, 55]. After the initial publication, the dataset will be updated as additional logs are collected and validated."

            "content": "Although standard sessionization often relies on fixed time-gap heuristics, agentic requests can arrive in fast parallel patterns [31], making pure temporal cutoff unreliable. We therefore sessionize with semantic-continuity criterion combined with an explicit temporal constraint. Concretely, for each IP we maintain active sessions and assign an incoming query to the most semantically continuous active session when the continuity score exceeds threshold; otherwise we start new session. We additionally impose 10-minute hard cutoff between consecutive queries within session, reflecting faster interaction loops than the conventional 30-minute rule for human logs [21, 41]. Among classifier-predicted continuous pairs, only 0.92% have gaps exceeding 10 minutes. The aforementioned pipeline yields 3.97M sessions. Manual spotchecks confirm that the resulting sessions are generally coherent. Full procedural details (i.e., continuity model, thresholds, and validation) are provided in Appendix A."

            "content": "Session-Level Intent: Different information needs may induce different search strategies. For instance, user seeking factual answer may behave differently from one debugging procedure or reasoning through complex question. To test whether agentic search exhibits such intent-conditioned structure, we label each session with an intent category. We adopt three-way taxonomy from web search goal modeling [4, 10, 39]: Declarative (fact retrieval), Procedural (method execution), and Reasoning (complex synthesis). Since 𝑞1 is often already reformulation, we assign intent from the whole session text. Trajectory-Level Reformulation: Intent alone does not reveal how agents iterate within session. An agent might narrow its query, broaden it, pivot to related facet, or retry with near-identical phrasing. These reformulation patterns have implications for retrieval efficiency: excessive repetition wastes budget, while lack of exploration may leave relevant facets unexamined. To capture these dynamics, we label each adjacent query pair (𝑞𝑘 𝑞𝑘+1) with trajectory type grounded in prior reformulation taxonomies [3, 15]: Specialization (narrowing by adding constraints), Generalization (broadening by relaxing constraints), Exploration (within-topic facet pivots) and Repetition (identical or near-duplicate reformulations). Representative examples are provided in Appendix C. Implementation: We implement labeling with gpt-5-nano [32]. We annotate multi-turn sessions with 𝑠 [2, 10] for intent (one label per session) and all adjacent pairs for trajectories (one label per pair). We focus on this range because our sessionization analysis (Section 5) reveals that it covers 90.32% of all multi-turn traffic, representing the core behavior of current agents. To assess labeling robustness, we compare labels from two models (gpt-5-nano and gemini-3-flash-preview [13]) on 2000-pair random subset, achieving 95.15% agreement; the remaining disagreements are spread across categories rather than concentrated in any single label. Prompts are provided in Appendix D. Unless otherwise noted, analyses from Section 6 onward use random subset of labeled multi-turn sessions under the annotation budget (excluding singlequery sessions and outlier long-tail sessions, as described in Section 5). We also compute auxiliary metrics used throughout the paper, each defined at first use with summary in Appendix B."

We use exact-match tracing rather than semantic similarity because it is interpretable without threshold tuning, robust across domains and query styles, and conservative, i.e., semantic variants would typically yield higher rates by crediting paraphrases and near matches. Let 𝑇 𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑠 (𝑥) denote the set of unique, lowercased, and nonstopword tokens that can be extracted from text 𝑥. For trajectory (𝑞𝑘 𝑞𝑘+1), the set of newly introduced terms is: 𝑁 𝑒𝑤𝑇 𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑠 (𝑞𝑘+1, 𝑞𝑘 ) = 𝑇 𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑠 (𝑞𝑘+1) 𝑇 𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑠 (𝑞𝑘 ). (1) Let 𝐸𝑘 denote the textual evidence available at step 𝑘.

CTAR𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡 captures adoption from the immediately preceding step, while CTAR𝑎𝑔𝑔 captures adoption from any prior step, enabling us to test whether agents integrate evidence across the full session or rely only on the most recent retrieval. Comparing the two allows quantifying the contribution of earlier context, and identifying session types or phases where evidence integration breaks down."

            "content": "Session Length and Structural Composition: The corpus comprises 3.97M unique search sessions with skewed length distribution (Figure 3, left). Nearly half (47.77%) are single-query sessions (likely one-off API calls or simple lookups), with manual inspection suggesting that these are predominantly Declarative or Procedural queries. Among multi-turn sessions, 90% have length 10, indicating that most multi-turn sessions in the log resolve within few iterations, though some extend considerably further. Figure 3: Left: distribution of session length (number of queries per session). Right: distribution of step-wise time intervals between consecutive requests. For reference, human web search logs are slightly shorter on average (1.7 queries per session) and include substantially larger fraction of single-query sessions (77.6%) [10, 41], suggesting that agentic systems engage in more extended information-seeking episodes. We focus subsequent analyses on multi-turn sessions. Temporal Dynamics and Interaction Speed: Within-session intervals are short for most steps, where 56.12% fall within 010 seconds, and 89.21% are under one minute (Figure 3, right). Intervals are heavy-tailed, reflecting occasional long-latency steps due to system or pipeline delays. For reference, prior human log studies report median dwell times of several minutes for knowledge-acquisition intents [10]. While dwell time and session duration are not directly comparable to our inter-step intervals, the contrast highlights the faster iterative pacing typical of agentic search. Retrieval Depth and Parameter Stability: Retrieval depth is concentrated at fixed values 𝐾 {1, 5, 10}, with only 8.36% of sessions using other values. Furthermore, only 1.35% of sessions vary 𝐾 across steps. Since DRGym supports 1 𝐾 100, this suggests that many agents treat retrieval count as effectively hard-coded rather than adapted within session."

Retrieval Depth summarizes per-step 𝐾 at the session level, and Initial-Final Gap measures semantic drift from first to last query 1 cos(𝑞1, 𝑞 𝑠 ) using Qwen3-Embedding0.6B [52]. Formal definitions are in Appendix B. Declarative sessions use the shallowest retrieval yet incur the highest interaction costs. This suggests that limited evidence per step forces agents into more iterations to locate and verify information. The pattern contrasts with human fact-finding, where users issue fewer and shorter queries [8, 10, 41]. Agents instead phrase queries as full constraint-bearing questions, consistent with iterative verification behavior [19]. Procedural sessions show the opposite pattern. Deeper retrieval accompanies more semantically stable progression, suggesting that broader evidence coverage reduces the need for iterative refinement. Queries within these sessions are longer than Declarative ones, consistent with prior studies of procedural search reporting similar characteristics [10]. Finally, we observe that Reasoning sessions match Declarative in turn count but differ in how queries evolve. They show the largest semantic drift and longest queries, while retrieval depth is moderate. The distinguishing signal for Reasoning lies in within-session query reformulation rather than session duration or retrieval depth."

The Drill-Down Bias: Across intents, agents mainly tighten constraints via local edits or pivot across nearby facets, while explicit broadening is consistently the least-used move (under 11%; Table 5). This imbalance suggests that agents are more comfortable focusing on local neighborhood of the query space rather than stepping back to relax constraints and reconsider alternatives. Exploration is common (roughly 3648%), but pivots tend to induce larger evidence turnover and slower transitions, making them costlier than incremental refinement  (Table 4)  . Together, these signatures suggest that when progress stalls, agents often continue local edits rather than deliberately broadening and re-planning, motivating improved controller policies and training signals. Intent Differences: Although all intents share the same move vocabulary, they exhibit different interaction patterns  (Table 5)  . Declarative sessions are most prone to retry-like behavior, with Repetition at about one-third of moves, consistent with agents re-issuing near-duplicate queries when evidence remains elusive. Reasoning sessions, in contrast, sustain the highest pivoting (Exploration near 48%) with lower retrying, suggesting broader search over sub-questions. Procedural sessions more often combine pivots with subsequent constraint tightening, aligning with an explore then refine workflow in step-by-step tasks. Stability as Diagnostic: Table 4 reveals stability spectrum. Repetition largely preserves retrieved results (Result Overlap 78%), whereas Exploration induces major evidence turnover (Result Overlap 7%). Specialization and Generalization fall between these extremes, typically preserving part of the retrieved context while Agentic Search in the Wild: Intents and Trajectory Dynamics from 14M+ Real Search Requests SIGIR 26, July 2024, 2026, Melbourne Naarm, Australia Figure 4: Step-wise trajectory distribution trends for the first 10 steps across different task intents. Each sub-figure illustrates the evolving proportions of Specialization, Generalization, Exploration, and Repetition as the search session progresses. Figure 5: Declarative retry-loop example dominated by near-duplicate reformulations. steering the query. This suggests that sustained high-stability runs, especially Repetition, signal stagnation, whereas Exploration and Specialization more often accompany evidence-seeking progress. Figure 5 illustrates the contrast in real session. The agent briefly generalizes and then immediately re-specializes (Q1Q2Q3), and the interaction then transitions into high-stability retry loop (Q3Q8) where the intent remains largely unchanged despite minor wording edits. This example helps explain why Repetition is prominent in Declarative tasks and highlights an intervention point. Detecting such loops can trigger strategy switch (e.g., to Exploration) to break the cycle. We connect these regimes to evidence reuse signals (e.g., term adoption) in Section 7.3. Pacing Implications: Move types also differ in end-to-end pacing between requests  (Table 4)  . Exploration is slower (median of 14.0s) than minor reformulations such as Repetition (6.0s), consistent with facet pivots inducing larger evidence turnover and higher processing cost. This makes strategy selection consequential, when pivots are expensive, agents may default to cheaper local edits unless they learn when refinement is no longer productive. Although explicit broadening is rare, it is often followed by re-specialization in the transition dynamics (Section 7.2), consistent with broadening acting as brief reset rather than sustained re-planning."

Early steps mix facet pivots, retries, and constraint adjustments, then diverge by task type (Figure 4). Declarative sessions gradually concentrate on retries, consistent with late-stage stagnation; Procedural sessions maintain substantial pivoting but increasingly emphasize refinement; and Reasoning sessions sustain pivoting with consistently low retrying. We report the full step-wise proportions in Figure 4 and focus here on higher-level directional shifts. Transition Mechanisms: Figure 6 helps explain these trends by showing which moves persist as runs and which act as resets. Exploration and Repetition often form multi-step runs, consistent with the step-wise patterns in Figure 4 where pivoting and retrying persist across consecutive steps. In contrast, broadening frequently acts as brief reset, nearly half of Generalization moves are followed by Specialization, suggesting that agents relax constraints momentarily before re-introducing them. Case Study - The Reset-then-Refine Pattern: Figure 7 illustrates reset-then-refine sequence. The agent specializes broad topic by adding constraints (Napoleon campaigns Italy 1796), then generalizes by removing them (a shorter, broader query), and respecializes toward different facet (Egyptian expedition). Querylength changes match our definitions, where Specialization tends to lengthen queries, while Generalization shortens them  (Table 4)  . This is consistent with Generalization acting as lightweight backtracking to switch refinement branches rather than sustained broadening.

Thus, we\nmeasure context traceability by testing whether new query terms\nintroduced at step 𝑘+1 appear in the evidence context up to step 𝑘.\nWe use CTAR as defined in Section. 4.2 and report both last-step\nand aggregated variants.",
            "content": "Evidence of Context Grounding and Recency Effect: The CTAR analysis indicates that substantial fraction of newly introduced query terms can be lexically traced to retrieved evidence. Table 6 reports the mean CTAR under aggregated versus last-step context. Key observations are that overall more than half of newly introduced query terms are present in the aggregated evidence context (mean CTAR = 54.35%), aggregated context adds +5.81 percentage points over last-step evidence suggesting strong reliance on recent evidence with additional benefit from earlier steps [26], and CTAR varies substantially by trajectory type, with Specialization and Exploration much higher than Repetition (78.35%/69.59% vs. 20.92% under aggregated context). CTAR is intentionally lexical traceability measure (based on token overlap), rather than semantic variant, to avoid embeddingmodel dependence and uninterpretable similarity-threshold choices. As result, low CTAR score does not necessarily imply that the agent ignores evidence. Conversely, high CTAR score indicates that new terms are explicitly present in the context, but it does not by itself establish causality. Multi-step Context Contribution: We further examine how CTAR varies when tracing new terms against evidence from different historical steps within session. Figure 8 summarizes the CTAR measured against progressively older evidence contexts. For example, value of 70.93% for Spec at previous step 1 means that, for Specialization transitions, 70.93% of newly introduced terms in 𝑞𝑘+1 also appear in the evidence retrieved at the immediately preceding step 𝐸𝑘 (i.e., the Last Step context in Table 6); previous Table 6: Mean CTAR under Aggregated vs. Last-step Evidence.

The curves suggest that for trajectory types with higher CTAR, term adoption remains non-trivial beyond the immediate previous step, indicating that historical context can contribute to query reformulation, in addition to the most recent evidence. Taken together, these results suggest that the agents query reformulation behavior is frequently consistent with evidence-grounded term adoption, where new query terms are often directly traceable to retrieved context, with strong reliance on the most recent step and additional contributions from earlier steps."

            "content": "Repetition as Potential Stall Signal: In Declarative sessions, repetition increases to 42.68% by Step 9 (Figure 4), indicating that agents can enter near-duplicate loops when retrieved evidence does not diversify. Repetition can therefore be treated not only as redundancy but also as practical stall signal. Systems may benefit from early-detection guards that trigger strategy switch (e.g., forcing Generalization move) or escalation to human-in-theloop when lexical repetition exceeds threshold [11, 42]. Intent-Adaptive Resource Allocation: Retrieval depth is largely rigid, with 91.64% of requests using 𝐾 {1, 5, 10}, despite intentdependent needs (e.g., deeper retrieval for Procedural than Declarative). This suggests retrieval is often treated as static hyperparameter. Future architectures may adopt intent-aware budgeting that adjusts compute and retrieval depth across intents and steps, rather than relying on fixed 𝐾 choices [18]. Evidence Grounding as an Audit Signal: The gain in CTAR from aggregated context (+5.81 pp over the last-step) shows that agents actively synthesize historical evidence. Crucially, the sharp contrast in grounding between progress-oriented moves like Specialization (78.35% CTAR), and moves with lower CTAR like Repetition (20.92% CTAR), suggests that low evidence adoption is associated with retry loops. This motivates explicit context management modules that not only cache history but prioritize high-utility terms from earlier steps, to guide subsequent query formulation and reduce ungrounded exploration [44].

Our\ncentral takeaway is that multi-step agentic search exhibits intent-\nconditioned reformulation patterns that expose where agents make\nprogress versus stall (Sections 5–7). Importantly, our diversity anal-\nyses in Section 3 show that queries from this log is not simply\nrepetitions of popular benchmarks; instead, they cover a broad\nrange of semantic content, supporting the ecological validity of the\nbehavioral patterns we report. In particular, trajectories reveal a\ndrill-down bias. Agents favor local refinement and facet pivots over\ndeliberate broadening or backtracking. Declarative sessions exhibit\nsalient retry loops, while Procedural and Reasoning sessions show\ndistinct progression signatures (Sections 6–7). To study how multi-\nstep querying incorporates retrieved content without clicks, we\nintroduce CTAR and find that newly introduced query terms often\nalign with retrieved context across steps, suggesting non-trivial\ncross-step evidence reuse (Section 7.3).",
            "content": "These results suggest several implications for designing more reliable agentic IR systems. First, the move distributions, transition dynamics, and case studies in Section 7 highlight recurring pattern where agents often overuse inexpensive local edits rather than switching strategies. This motivates controller policies that detect high-stability loops and trigger structured interventions (e.g., forced facet pivots, purposeful backtracking, or adaptive retrieval budgeting). Second, our intent-conditioned analyses indicate that single global reformulation policy may be suboptimal; intent-aware guardrails can better balance refinement, exploration, and retrying under different tasks (Section 6). Third, CTAR offers lightweight audit signal for whether multi-step querying is evidence-driven, and can support memory designs that preserve useful context while reducing redundant retries (Section 7.3). Finally, we see several promising directions for follow-up work enabled by this study. Beyond releasing the DRGym-derived dataset and the analysis protocol, future research can connect reformulation moves to downstream answer quality, develop learning objectives that explicitly reward productive backtracking and evidencegrounded progress, and explore how retrieval parameters and context management should adapt over the course of session. More broadly, we hope these measurements and case-driven diagnostics provide foundation for intent-aware control and training of agentic search systems under reproducible retrieval settings.

Log Sessionization Procedure This section describes our log sessionization pipeline, including the semantic continuity model used to link adjacent queries and the per-IP online assignment rules used to form sessions. Step 1: Train semantic continuity model. (1) Training pairs: We randomly sample 200K queries and pair each query with the nearest-in-time query from the same IP. (2) Pair labels: We label each pair as same-session vs. different-session using an LLM-as-a-judge prompt with gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07 (Appendix D.1). (3) Pair representation: We encode each query with Qwen3-Embedding0.6B [52] and use the resulting embeddings to construct fixed dense feature vector for each query pair as input to the downstream neural classifier. (4) Classifier: We train 3-layer MLP to output continuity score in [0, 1]. The hidden-layer dimensions are 1024, 512, and 256, and the model achieves held-out accuracy of 0.9419. Step 2: Sessionize online per IP (with validation). (1) Per-IP assignment: We process queries in order and maintain active sessions for each IP. For an incoming query 𝑞𝑡 , we score it against each active session using the sessions most recent query and assign 𝑞𝑡 to the highest-scoring session if the score 0.5; otherwise we start new session. (2) Temporal hard cutoff: Beside the continuity score, if the gap to the candidate sessions last query exceeds 10 minutes, we start new session. (3) Sanity check: We manually inspect 100 random sessions for coherence; after excluding four unusually long sessions, the remaining sessions are centered on single objective. Auxiliary Metric Definitions This section defines the auxiliary metrics used throughout our analyses and provides their formal notation and formulas for reproducibility  (Table 7)  . Notation: For session 𝑠 = (𝑞1, . . . , 𝑞𝑠 ), let v𝑡 denote the dense embedding of query 𝑞𝑡 (and cos(, ) the cosine similarity). 𝑊𝑡 is the set of normalized tokens from 𝑞𝑡 after lowercasing and stopword-aware tokenization WS_tok(). 𝐷𝑡 is the set of retrieved evidence returned for query 𝑞𝑡 (at the logged retrieval depth).
