            "content": "In breast cancer pathology, accurate survival prediction fundamentally relies on the detailed analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs), which capture representation morphological characteristics that indicate tumor aggressiveness and potential treatment outcomes [9,47]. The high-resolution nature of these pathological images provides essential visual information about cellular patterns, tissue organization, and tumor heterogeneity that directly correlate with patient Equal contribution. Project lead. Corresponding author: y.zhao2@latrobe.edu.au. 2 PathoHR prognosis [23,24]. Recently, computational pathology has gained significant attention, with extensive research focusing on extracting and analyzing quantitative features from WSIs for survival prediction [29,8]. Despite notable advancements [21,19], cancer survival prediction remains challenging. The primary one lies in the significant tumor heterogeneity in pathology, where different regions of the same tumor exhibit distinct morphological characteristics, making it difficult to capture representative predictive patterns [22,26]. Besides, while high-resolution images contain detailed morphological information crucial for accurate prediction, processing such high-dimensional data demands substantial computational resources. Current approaches typically address this by cropping WSIs into smaller patches, but this creates another challenge: how to effectively learn and leverage the similarity features across different patches to capture the tumors overall characteristics [10,44]. This fundamental tension between maintaining high-resolution information and learning representative features across patches has limited the achievement of optimal predictive performance in clinical settings [20,37]. To address these challenges, we propose PathoHR, novel pipeline for breast cancer survival prediction that improves pathological image analysis through efficient multi-resolution processing and advanced feature representation learning. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (1) plug-and-play high-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) framework is introduced for flexible patch-wise WSI enhancement, designed to process patchbased pathology image regardless of input size. The framework integrates seamlessly with existing architectures to enhance patch-based WSIs, enabling the extraction of fine-grained morphological details that are critical for survival prediction while maintaining computational efficiency. (2) systematic evaluation of advanced similarity metrics is adapted for contrastive learning, designed to effectively discriminate between common and distinct features across multiple tumor regions. This comprehensive evaluation framework aims to address the challenge of tumor heterogeneity by effectively capturing and leveraging common characters across different patches. (3) streamlined approach for processing enhanced smaller image patches is established, aimed at achieving superior prediction accuracy while reducing computational demands. The framework demonstrates how high-resolution feature learning using raw large patches can be effectively accomplished with smaller patches, providing practical solution for clinical implementation."

            "content": "Representation Learning in Pathology. Representation learning has emerged as crucial approach in computational pathology, particularly in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of diagnostic models through advanced feature extraction techniques. Jaume et al. proposed the TANGLE framework, which leverages contrastive learning to align gene expression profiles with histology slide representations, significantly improving few-shot classification tasks [15]. PathoHR 3 Dynamic Resolution Adaptation in Vision Transformers. Dynamic resolution adaptation is critical capability for Vision Transformers (ViTs) [36,40,16] in medical imaging [27,46], where image resolutions can vary significantly. Fan et al. introduced ViTAR, Vision Transformer capable of processing images at any resolution through adaptive token merging and fuzzy position encoding [11]. This innovation significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for large-scale histology image analysis. Similarly, Sun et al. proposed HRNet (High-Resolution Network) [33], framework that maintains high-resolution representations throughout the network, which is crucial for position-sensitive vision problems such as human pose estimation, semantic segmentation [38,30,12,31,41,35,43], and object detection [45,42,5,6]. Wang et al. proposed HRFormer, high-resolution Transformer designed for dense prediction tasks, which maintains high-resolution representations throughout the network [34]. Feature Similarity in Whole Slide Images. The analysis of feature similarity in whole slide images (WSIs) is critical aspect of digital pathology, enabling accurate classification and diagnosis [14,39]. Recent advancements in this domain have leveraged various techniques to enhance the representation and similarity assessment of features within WSIs. For instance, Bui et al. proposed FALFormer, Transformer-based model that employs Nystr√∂m self-attention and feature-aware landmarks to capture the global relationships among patches in WSIs [4]. In addition, the HMIL framework, proposed by Jin et al., incorporates hierarchical multi-instance learning and supervised contrastive learning to address fine-grained classification tasks in WSIs [2]."

Initially, each WSI is cropped into small patches of defined size. An Otsus method is applied to identify tissue boundaries and eliminate holes, ensuring only relevant tissue regions are retained for analysis. Following the prior work [25], weakly supervised attention-based model with pre-trained UNI encoder [7] is adopted for feature extraction. In total 1024-dim features for each patch are generated for further representation learning. 4 PathoHR Fig. 1. The proposed PathoHR pipeline for breast cancer os prediction.

            "content": "Following the concept of contrastive learning, where the model learns to identify and group similar features, several similarity computation methods are proposed and systematically tested. The details are presented in Fig. 1(2) and Fig. 2. Pooled Attention Method. Same as the ViTAR work [11], obtained through average pooling operations that reduce the sequence length by half. The similarity is computed through standard projection operations, where q, k, and are derived from the input features through shared linear projection layer. Euclidean Distance Method. This method [17] quantifies token relationships based on their spatial distances in the feature space. Details are shown in Fig. 2(1). After obtaining pooled queries, the similarity is computed as sim(q, k) = exp (cid:118) (cid:117) (cid:117) (cid:116) (cid:88) (qi ki)2 œÑ i=1 (1) where œÑ is learnable temperature parameter that controls the sharpness of the similarity distribution. This distance-based approach captures local feature relationships in the embedding space. Cosine Distance Method. In Fig. 2(2), cosine distance method [18] is introduced. This method measures the angular correlation between token representations, focusing on directional relationships rather than absolute distances. PathoHR 5 Fig. 2. This figure illustrates five different methods of calculating similarity: (1) Euclidean Similarity [17]; (2) Cosine Similarity [18]; (3) Attention Score [13]; (4) Semantic Similarity [32]; and (5) ToMe Similarity [3]."

The normalization ensures that the similarity measure is invariant to the scale of the token representations. Attention Score Method. Attention score method [13] is introduced in Fig. 2(3) This method is built upon transformer architecture which benefits from the attention mechanism. The scaled dot-product attention with separate projections for queries, keys, and values are implemented in this work. The similarity is computed as sim(q, k) = softmax (cid:18) œÑ (cid:19) qkT (3) where represents the feature dimension. Semantic Similarity Method. The semantic similarity [32] introduces an additional layer of abstraction by projecting tokens through lower-dimensional semantic space. The aim is to capture higher-level semantic relationships between tokens through learned transformations. This method is shown in Fig. 2(4). The similarity is calculated as sim(q, k) = softmax (cid:18) fq(q) fk(k)T (cid:19) (4) where fq and fk are non-linear projection functions implemented as multi-layer perceptrons. ToMe Similarity Method. This method [3] reduces the use of computational resource usage and maintains model performance by applying token merging strategy based on bipartite soft matching. The architectural design is shown in Fig. 2(5) and aims to reduce computational overhead in similarity measurement by eliminating redundant token participation, thereby achieving optimized PathoHR computational density during large-scale token processing. The similarity is calculated as sim(q, k) = softmax (cid:16) GA(t) GB(t)T (cid:17) (5) where GA(t) and GB(t) are two tokens formed by grouping input tokens according to certain rules."

            "title": "3.3 Plug-in-play ViTAR Encoder",
            "content": "The plug-in-play ViTAR Encoder contains mainly two parts as shown in Fig. 1(3): Adaptive Token Merge (ATM) and Fuzzy Positional Encodings (FPE) [11]. ATM starts by calculating the similarities among patches. Then these similarities are served as query in cross-attention operation to merge all features. This similarity-based token merging adaptively reduces spatial dimensions while preserving essential features. The FPE mechanism further reinforces resolution robustness by introducing controlled positional uncertainty. Specifically, for token at position (i, j), its fuzzy positional encoding Pf is computed as: Pf (i, j) = (i + s1, + s2), s1, s2 (0.5, 0.5) (5) where represents the learnable positional embeddings, and denotes uniform distribution. Through this dual-mechanism architecture, ViTAR could efficiently process multi-resolution inputs by adaptively managing token density while maintaining spatial coherence, ensuring consistent performance across varying image scales. After ViTAR Encoder processes the input images and generates token representations, these tokens are further refined through the attention mechanisms of the Tangle architecture [15] to extract diagnostically relevant features. The pre-attention module applies multiple linear transformations with normalization and GELU activation to prepare patch features for attention computation. The gated-attention mechanism then employs dual-path architecture where features are processed through parallel tanh and sigmoid activations before being multiplied together. This multiplication generates attention weights that highlight important features such as diagnostic regions in the slide. The slide embedding is generated by weighting patch features with these attention scores and then applying mean aggregation. This allows the model to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while suppressing less informative areas. The detailed implementation steps of the proposed PathoHR pipeline are formally defined in Algorithm 1, which outlines the end-to-end procedure. The inputs are WSI, patch size, similarity threshold for token merging (œÑ ), transformer encoder block count (N), and transformer encoder iteration count (J). The output is overall survival (OS) prediction.
