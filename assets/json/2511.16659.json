            "content": "A principal component of UV unwrapping is surface parameterization, which flattens the 3D surface while trying to preserve geometric properties such as angles and areas. For meshes with complex geometry, flattening the entire surface into single 2D chart introduces large distortion. Consequently, chart segmentation (or seam cutting) is typically used to divide the mesh into multiple charts along strategically placed seams, allowing each chart to be flattened with reduced distortion. Finally, UV packing arranges the resulting charts within the unit square (the UV atlas) to maximize texture-space use. Although UV unwrapping has been studied extensively, existing methods are typically tuned for well-behaved meshes, such as those created by professional 3D artists. They often fail on more complex, AI-generated meshes. Such meshes, typically extracted from neural-field isosurfaces (e.g., via marching cubes [Lorensen and Cline 1998]), tend to have bumpy surfaces, many small triangles, and poor geometric quality (e.g., disconnected components or holes). On such data, existing methods may time-out or return extremely fragmented atlases in which single chart holds only one or handful of triangles. This extreme fragmentation hampers texture painting and editing, introduces texture-bleed and baking or rendering artifacts at chart boundaries, and burdens downstream applications with an unwieldy number of charts. Some recent approaches mitigate fragmentation [Srinivasan et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024; Zhao et al. 2025] by representing the UV mapping using neural field and optimizing such field for each 3D shape from scratch. While these methods can effectively control the number of charts generated, they typically run for more than thirty minutes and still exhibit noticeable distortion. Other methods [Li SA Conference Papers 25, December 1518, 2025, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. et al. 2018; Poranne et al. 2017] jointly optimize seam length and distortion but are likewise computationally expensive. Moreover, some existing approaches like [Lévy et al. 2002; Sorkine et al. 2002; Zhou et al. 2004] segment charts or identify seams using heuristics based on local geometric properties, rather than leveraging the concept of geometric or semantic parts. This can lead to unintuitive or suboptimal chart boundaries that split semantically coherent regions across multiple charts, further complicating downstream tasks such as texture authoring, part-based editing, and semanticaware rendering. In this paper, we introduce PartUV, part-based UV unwrapping pipeline for 3D meshes that generates UV mappings with small number of part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion, as well as robust and efficient processingtypically completed within few to several tens of seconds. PartUV builds on recent learning-based method, PartField [Liu et al. 2025], which produces hierarchical part tree for the input mesh. PartUV also proposes several novel geometric heuristics that further decompose simple local parts into charts that can be flattened with minimal distortion. Combining high-level semantic decomposition from PartField with fine-grained geometric cuts, PartUV employs top-down recursive search that minimizes chart count while keeping each charts distortion below user-specified threshold. PartUV uses established surface parameterization algorithms (e.g., ABF++ [Sheffer et al. 2005]) for chart flattening and proven packing algorithms for optimal atlas layout. To ensure high speed and robustness, the pipeline incorporates extensive parallelization and acceleration strategies, as well as dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate cases. By explicitly incorporating semantic priors, our approach yields several key benefits. First, semantics improve decomposition by reducing excessive reliance on local geometry, which often causes over-segmentation and long runtimes. Second, semantic cues preserve the coherence of object parts, preventing chart boundaries from cutting through meaningful regions (e.g., across the flat surface of TV screen, as in Figure 7, or human face), thereby facilitating editing and rendering tasks. Third, semantic grouping naturally supports better chart packing strategies, allowing related charts to be organized togethereither within single atlas (top right of Figure 1) or across multiple atlases (bottom right of Figure 1). This enhances organizational clarity and simplifies the process of locating and editing related charts. Finally, seams guided by semantic boundaries tend to fall in perceptually unobtrusive locations, improving the visual quality of textured models. We evaluate PartUV on four datasets spanning man-made, AIgenerated, CAD models, and common 3D shapes (e.g., Stanford Bunny, XYZ Dragon), and compare it against widely used UV unwrapping tools such as xatlas [Young 2019], Blender [Community [n.d.]], and Open3D [Zhou et al. 2018a], as well as the recent neural-based methods [Srinivasan et al. 2024]. As shown in Figure 1, our method decomposes input meshes into significantly fewer chartsalso resulting in shorter seam lengthswhile maintaining low angular and area distortion comparable to baseline methods. The incorporation of explicit part priors not only helps the segmented charts better align with part boundaries but also enables new applications, such as packing semantic-aligned parts into separate atlases. Moreover, PartUV maintains high success rate, handles wide range of meshes (including large, complex, and non-manifold ones), and processes each mesh quicklytypically within few to several tens of seconds. PartUV integrates high-level semantic part priors from learningbased module with novel local geometric decomposition strategies via top-down recursive tree search.

            "content": "To enhance UV chart decomposition, we explore the integration of semantic part priors. Traditional learning-based part segmentation methods [Jiang et al. 2020; Qian et al. 2022; Vu et al. 2022] are restricted to closed-set categories due to the limited scale of part-annotated datasets [Mo et al. 2019; Yi et al. 2016].

In contrast, recent method, PartField [Liu et al. 2025], introduces feedforward model that learns part-aware feature fields for fast, hierarchical 3D part decomposition. While semantic priors intuitively benefit UV unwrapping, naïve integration can yield suboptimal results. PartUV addresses this with novel top-down strategy that interleaves semantic segmentation and geometric flattening."

The primary challenge lies in decomposing the mesh into charts {𝐶𝑘 }, task essentially equivalent to identifying optimal seams for mesh segmentation. Many state-of-the-art methods, such as xatlas and Blenders Smart UV, rely on geometric heuristicssuch as SA Conference Papers 25, December 1518, 2025, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. 4 Zhaoning Wang, Xinyue Wei, Ruoxi Shi, Xiaoshuai Zhang, Hao Su, and Minghua Liu Fig. 2. Pipeline of PartUV. Given mesh M, we first leverage the learning-based method PartField to predict part-aware feature field. By applying clustering algorithm to this field, we obtain hierarchical part tree for the input mesh M. We then recursively traverse the part tree starting from the root node. For each visited node P, we apply two novel geometry-based strategies to segment the corresponding part mesh into multiple sets of charts 𝒞. Each chart in the set is then flattened using the ABF algorithm [Sheffer et al. 2005], and its distortion is evaluated. If the distortion exceeds user-specified threshold 𝜏, we recursively traverse the left and right children of the part tree T. Otherwise, we adopt the segmented charts and their corresponding UV mappings for the part mesh. bottom-up greedy chart expansion based on face normals or distortion metricsto generate these charts. However, these strategies typically produce overly fragmented charts and unintuitive or suboptimal boundaries, often splitting semantically coherent regions across multiple charts. In contrast, PartUV adopts coarse-to-fine, two-stage strategy for mesh decomposition. At high level, it employs recent learningbased method called PartField (introduced in Section 3.2) to partition mesh faces into semantically coherent parts: 𝐹 = (cid:208)𝑀 𝑚=1 𝑃𝑚, where each part 𝑃𝑘 exhibits relatively simple geometryfor instance, cylindrical limbs, spherical toes. Subsequently, we introduce two geometry-based heuristics (detailed in Section 3.4) to further segment each part into small set of charts: 𝑃𝑚 = (cid:208)𝑁𝑚 𝑛=1 𝐶𝑚,𝑛, ensuring each resulting chart 𝐶𝑚,𝑛 can be flattened onto 2D plane with minimal distortion. To accomplish this, PartUV employs top-down recursive decomposition search (detailed in Section 3.3) that minimizes the total number of generated charts while ensuring the distortion for each chart remains below user-specified threshold 𝜏. Since exhaustive decomposition searches can incur substantial computational overhead, we introduce acceleration and parallelization techniques for efficiency. To ensure complete and robust pipeline, Section 3.5 also describes additional preprocessing and postprocessing procedures, including handling non-manifold and multi-component meshes, as well as performing UV packing."

            "content": "A straightforward approach to mesh decomposition might involve using PartField to directly generate fixed number of parts and attempting to flatten each to 2D individually. Alternatively, one could adaptively traverse from the root downward, checking whether each nodes corresponding geometry can be flattened into 2D chart with minimal distortion. However, we observe that relying solely on parts generated by PartField often leads to suboptimal results. This limitation arises because PartField primarily focuses on semantic or coarse geometric partitioning and is less effective for finer-scale, UV-related decompositionssuch as accurately segmenting cylindrical or spherical regions into charts that minimize distortion. To address this challenge, PartUV leverages PartField primarily for high-level semantic decomposition into geometrically simpler subparts and employs two geometry-based heuristics (elaborated in Section 3.4) to further divide these semantically meaningful parts into smaller charts amenable to low-distortion flattening. The search algorithm interleaves these two strategies. Formally, PartUV employs top-down recursive decomposition searchdetailed in Algorithm 1to optimally balance the chart count against distortion constraints.

If no feasible decomposition exists, the algorithm returns failure (). Specifically, the algorithm begins by generating candidate chart decompositions for node Ps mesh using primary geometric heuristic (Heuristic1). Each candidate chart set 𝒞 = {𝐶𝑖 }, consisting of up to 𝑡 charts, is flattened using Angle-Based Flattening (ABF), and its distortion is evaluated. If none of the candidate decompositions with up to 𝑡 charts from Heuristic1 satisfy the distortion constraint (i.e., 𝛿min > 𝜏), the algorithm utilizes the PartField tree to divide the mesh and recursively searches both the left and right child subtrees without budget constraints, then merges their respective optimal chart sets. Conversely, if an admissible candidate decomposition is found through Heuristic1, we further refine it using secondary heuristic (Heuristic2) designed to potentially yield fewer charts. Among these PartUV: Part-Based UV Unwrapping of 3D Meshes 5 candidates, we select the best solution 𝒞best with the minimal chart count that satisfies the distortion and overlap constraints. Before accepting this solution, the algorithm performs final check by recursively exploring the left and right child nodes of the PartField subtree, using reduced chart budget (𝐵), which is derived from the best candidates chart count minus one. If the combined solution from this subtree search yields valid and superior decomposition (i.e., fewer charts than 𝒞best), it replaces the previously identified best solution. The chart budget 𝐵 prevents the search from going too deep. As the search progresses, 𝐵 tightens, and recursion stops when candidates exceed it. In practice, the search rarely goes very deep. By strategically interleaving hierarchical semantic guidance from PartField with fine-grained geometric heuristics and systematic recursive exploration, our proposed decomposition search achieves semantically coherent, distortion-bounded, and notably compact mesh parameterizationscharacterized by small number of charts."

The goal is to divide 𝑃𝑚 into multiple charts,\ndenoted as 𝑃𝑚 = (cid:208)𝑁𝑚\n𝑛=1 𝐶𝑚,𝑛, such that each chart can be flattened\nto 2D with low distortion.",
            "content": "The first heuristic, referred to as Normal (line 5 in Algorithm 1), is based on face normals. We apply an agglomerative clustering algorithm [Johnson 1967] to the face normals of 𝑃𝑚s mesh, partitioning its triangle faces into charts, where each chart is composed of connected faces with similar normals. This clustering is performed once for 𝑃𝑚, producing 𝑡 candidate decompositions with 1 to 𝑡 charts (we use 𝑡 = 10 in our experiments). For each candidate decomposition, we apply the Angle-Based Flattening (ABF) algorithm to flatten the charts and evaluate distortion. Since ABF aims to preserve angles, we quantify distortion using an area stretch metric, defined as: distortion(𝒞) = max 𝐶 𝒞 (cid:169) (cid:173) (cid:171) 1 𝐶 𝑓 𝐶 (cid:18) max stretch(𝑓 ), (cid:19) 1 stretch(𝑓 ) , (3) (cid:170) (cid:174) (cid:172) where 𝐶 denotes single chart composed of multiple connected faces, and 𝒞 denotes the set of all charts in the decomposition. The stretch of triangle face 𝑓 is computed as: (cid:44) area2𝐷 (𝑓 ) area3𝐷 (𝑓 ) 1 𝐶 area2𝐷 (𝑓 ) area3𝐷 (𝑓 ) . (4) 𝑓 𝐶 stretch(𝑓 ) = (cid:169) (cid:173) (cid:171) Note that both PartField and the Normal heuristic employ the agglomerative clustering algorithm to group faces into parts or charts. The key difference lies in the features used: PartField utilizes learned high-level part features, while heuristic Normal relies on low-level geometric face normals. These two strategies are thus consistent in spirit and complementary in practice. (cid:170) (cid:174) (cid:172) The Normal heuristic is simple, fast, and often yields satisfactory results. However, we also propose second, more computationally expensive heuristic, called Merge (line 14 in Algorithm 1), which may produce decompositions with fewer charts. Given part 𝑃𝑚, the Merge heuristic begins by computing its oriented bounding box (OBB). It then assigns each triangle face label from 1 to 6, corresponding to the OBB face normal with which the triangles SA Conference Papers 25, December 1518, 2025, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. 6 Zhaoning Wang, Xinyue Wei, Ruoxi Shi, Xiaoshuai Zhang, Hao Su, and Minghua Liu normal is most closely aligned. Using both face connectivity and these labels, we segment the faces into multiple connected components. These components are then sorted by size (small to large), and we iteratively attempt to merge each component with its adjacent neighbors, starting from the one with the longest shared edges. For each merge attempt, we temporarily merge two components and apply ABF to flatten the combined chart. The merge is accepted if the resulting chart satisfies the distortion threshold and is free of overlaps. This merging process continues until no further valid merges can be made, after which the final chart set is returned. Since the Merge heuristic often begins with many small components and performs multiple ABF calls during its iterative merging process, it is significantly more expensive than the Normal heuristic. However, it may yield better decompositions with fewer charts. Therefore, we only invoke the Merge heuristic when the Normal heuristic returns valid (admissible) decomposition."

To comprehensively evaluate the approaches\nacross diverse mesh sources, qualities, and styles, we use four datasets:\n(a) Common Shapes [Jacobson 2013], a GitHub repository of 24\nwidely used models in graphics (e.g., Bimba, Igea, Stanford Bunny)\nwith provided processed .obj files; (b) PartObjaverseTiny [Yang et al.\n2024], a 200-shape subset of Objaverse [Deitke et al. 2022] featur-\ning high-quality, man-made meshes with multiple components and\nsmooth surfaces; (c) ABC [Koch et al. 2019], a CAD dataset of me-\nchanical models combining sharp and smooth features—we use\nthe first 100 meshes from its initial batch; and (d) Trellis [Xiang\net al. 2024], which includes 114 AI-generated meshes from a recent\n3D diffusion-based generative model. These meshes are typically\nnoisy and geometrically low-quality, posing greater challenges than\nhuman-made counterparts.\nEvaluation Metrics. We evaluate the quality of the generated UV\nmaps from four perspectives: (1) Number of Charts: For each shape,\nwe count the number of charts and report both the average and\nmedian values across the dataset. (2) Seam Length: We compute the\nseam length by summing the lengths of all chart boundary edges,\nwith UV coordinates normalized to a [0, 1] grid. The median value\nis reported across the dataset. (3) Angular (Conformal) Distortion:\nWe compute the cosine between the tangent and bitangent vectors\nof each face. The distortion for a shape is defined as one minus the\naverage cosine across all faces [Srinivasan et al. 2024]. We report the\naverage distortion across the dataset. (4) Area (Equiareal) Distortion:\nWe compute both area distortion and overall area distortion. Area\ndistortion is defined as in Equation 3, based on the chart with the\nhighest distortion in each shape. Overall area distortion is computed",

For these cases, Open3D achieves similar number of charts and seam lengths compared to our method. However, this comes at the cost of significant distortion. For instance, while Blender, xatlas, and PartUV all achieve angular distortion scores mostly above 0.95 across all datasets, Open3D consistently falls below 0.9 and even 0.8 in some cases. similar phenomenon is observed for area distortion.

The examples are gathered across the four datasets we used in the main paper. The metrics are computed and reported for individual shapes. A1.2 Efficiency As we create the UV map with regard to semantic features and groups, it may raise doubts regarding the final efficiency of the resulting UV maps. In Table 6, we show the comparison of the average efficiency of valid results between our method and the baselines. In our experiments, we always group the charts from the same parts when packing, and we use UVPackMaster [Łukasz Czyż 2025] to get the final packed UV map. We set the \"heuristic search\" time to 3 seconds for UVPackMaster, while most meshes finish within microseconds. We define efficiency as the total area of valid 2D faces within the normalized 01 UV space. It can be seen that our method does not hurt the overall efficiency, and it remains competitive compared to our baseline methods. A1.3 Analysis and Visualization of Open3D Results In our experiments, particularly on the more challenging meshes, Open3D frequently crashed or exceeded the allotted time budget. Fig. 13. When using the face normals as agglomerative features for topdown tree construction, the pipeline generates messier results with no semantic alignment. We designate shape as timed-out when its runtime surpasses 30 seconds plus three times the longest runtime among other methods on the current shape. Even for the shapes where Open3D successfully produces UV map, the results still exhibit notable shortcomings. At first glance, Open3D seemingly generates results with chart numbers similar to our method, albeit with slightly higher distortion. However, such differences in distortion can significantly affect downstream tasks. In Fig. 12, we show one example from the ABC dataset, which Open3D creates layout with similar chart number with ours. However, with 0.2 difference in area distortion and 0.1 difference in angular distortion, the deformation of the texture is clearly noticeable. In particular, when using striped texture, angular distortion leads to curved lines (bottom half of highlighted region), while area distortion causes uneven width (top half of highlighted region)both prominently visible in the red-marked rectangle of the figure, not to mention the seams that disregard underlying geometric features. In contrast, our results exhibit minimal distortion, maintain the regularity of the shape, and feature seams that largely respect the underlying geometric structure. A2 Additional Ablation Results A2.1 Replacing PartField feature with Face Normals In our main pipeline, we create top-down tree of faces with agglomerative clustering of PartField-predicted features. simpler alternative would be replacing such features with face normals. In Fig. 13, we provide some visual examples of meshes using normal as Agglomerative features versus using the PartField-predicted ones. It can be seen that using normal is substantially prone to producing curly shapes, like the cherry on the left. Moreover, though being able to predict similar number of charts under the same heuristic settings, using normal as the agglomerative features leads to way less organized and neat UV layouts, as exemplified on the right of the figure. SA Conference Papers 25, December 1518, 2025, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Fig. 15. Using only Merge heuristic from the beginning would incur more runtime, and more fragmented charts on bumpy meshes. A2.4 Using LSCM instead of ABF++ In our main pipeline, we adopt ABF++ [Sheffer et al. 2005] as the primary flattening algorithm due to its fast performance and lowdistortion mappings. Most of our baselines utilize LSCM [Lévy et al. 2002], which generally offers faster runtimes thanks to its linear energy formulation. However, despite its speed, LSCM generally produces inferior mapping results compared to ABF++. Such suboptimal outputs can trigger additional recursions in our pipeline, resulting in increased runtimes and more fragmented UV charts. As shown in Table 7, using LSCM ultimately leads to both higher runtime and larger number of charts on the Trellis dataset. 12 Zhaoning Wang, Xinyue Wei, Ruoxi Shi, Xiaoshuai Zhang, Hao Su, and Minghua Liu Fig. 14.

Despite the higher cost of computation, Merge often produces more visually appealing UV maps with fewer charts. As illustrated in Fig. 14, the Merge heuristic can usually unwrap the part in an \"unfolding\" manner, creating less number of charts with neater layout, comparing under the same distortion threshold requirements with using only the Normal Heuristics. A2.3 Without Normal Heuristic With two heuristics included in the pipeline, one can also opt to use only the Merge throughout the pipeline. We show several example results in Fig. 15. Due to its high computational cost, using only Merge, especially at the beginning, incurs substantial runtime overhead. To be precise, the Merge heuristic would compute an oriented bounding box (OBB) and use projection to get initial charts, and it could get hundreds of charts from bumpy input. Trying to merge all of them would introduce significant overhead for such bumpy/uneven meshes. For example, on the bimba mesh on the right side of the figure, the runtime increases from 147 seconds to over 892 seconds. Moreover, due to its bumpy geometry, the merging process often results in overlapping, leading to an increase in the number of charts. In essence, Merge could yield better results, but only on simpler shapes. Therefore, it is most effective as complement to the Normal heuristic and should be invoked only when Normal produces sufficiently good result.
