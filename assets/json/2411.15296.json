            "content": "L ARGE Language Models (LLMs) [1] are sweeping across the whole artificial intelligence community. Through scaling up the size of model parameters and training corpus, LLMs exhibit emergent capabilities, such as following instructions [2] and learning from context [3]. Distinct from previous paradigms that train specific model for specific task, LLMs are competent in solving wide array of general tasks through prompting. Furthermore, LLMs can only support language while our world is naturally multimodal, encompassing information of various forms, e.g. vision and audio [4]. This limitation spurs the rise of newer family of models, i.e. MLLMs [5], [6]. Building upon LLMs, MLLMs are further equipped with capabilities of processing multimodal information, which considerably expands the task coverage of models. In the process of MLLM development, model evaluation has played crucial role since it quantitatively reflects Chaoyou Fu is the project leader.

The upgraded models, in turn, stimulate the rise of new benchmarks that entail more advanced capabilities. As MLLMs have evolved at an amazing speed in recent years, dazzling new specifically designed evaluation benchmarks have emerged, as shown in Fig. 1. This brings inconvenience to researchers searching for apt benchmarks and those who aim to optimize current evaluation methods or introduce new benchmarks. To this end, this work presents comprehensive and systematic survey for MLLM evaluation, aiming to cover four key issues: 1) What capabilities are assessed? We organize hierarchical taxonomy of existing benchmarks. On the top level, these benchmarks can be categorized as evaluations of foundational capabilities, model behavior, and extended applications. 2) How to build benchmark? To be specific, we collate typical approaches in the pipeline of benchmark construction, including the gathering of samples and the annotation of Question-Answer (QA) pairs. We also discuss what may require special care during the assessment of models, e.g. data contamination, benchmark diversity, and sample size. 3) How to measure the performance? In terms of evaluation methods, we illustrate three representative ways to gauge the performance of MLLMs: human-based, LLM/MLLM-based, and script-based evaluation. In addition, we also introduce two major types of evaluation metrics as well as four evaluation toolkits. 4) Where is the direction of the next benchmark?

We hope this survey can help researchers find the appropriate benchmarks more easily and spark explorations of benchmarks that better reflect model strengths and weaknesses, as well as more efficient and reasonable evaluation methods. We will regularly update new evaluation papers on our project page, organizing the community to work together to promote progress in this area."

            "content": "A typical MLLM comprises three modules: modality encoder [7], LLM, and connector between them, as presented in Fig. 2. Take the vision-language model as an example, given text query and vision sample, the vision encoder extracts features from the vision sample, while the connector aligns the vision features with the text embedding space. Subsequently, the aligned vision features are concatenated with the text embeddings of user queries as input. The LLM takes this multimodal input and generates natural language response. Similar to how LLMs process information, the core of MLLM is unified autoregressive modeling: p(wowV , wT ) (cid:89) t= (wtw<t, wV , wT ) (1) where wo = {wo,t}L t=1 is the output word token sequence of length L, wV represents the processed vision tokens, and wT corresponds to text embeddings of the user query. Fig. 2: Typical MLLM architecture. Tokenizer and DeTokenizer are used for the processing of text, as the standard flow of LLM. With respect to other modalities, specialized encoders and connectors are often required to convert them into tokens, as well pre-trained generators [10], [11] to enable multimodal generation capabilities. There are also methods that employ purely discrete modeling to achieve both understanding and generation [12]."

            "title": "2.2 Training of MLLM",
            "content": "We can see from Fig. 3, comprehensive training process of MLLMs consists of three stages, i.e. pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment tuning. Pre-training. The main objective of the pre-training stage is to align different modalities [8] and inject multimodal world knowledge into models. The pre-training stage typically involves large-scale text based paired data, such as image caption data [9]. Generally speaking, the captions are translations of images, describing the content in natural language. To align vision with text, MLLMs learn to predict the ground-truth captions of the corresponding images in an autoregressive way. Instruction Tuning. Its purpose is to teach MLLMs to follow instructions from users and complete the required tasks. Tuning in this way, MLLMs can generalize to new tasks defined by new instructions, thereby boosting zeroshot performance. Instruction data can be derived from the adaptation of existing multi-task datasets, e.g. VQA, or JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, NOVEMBER 2024 3 extensive public datasets, including 47 standard text-related visual benchmarks. The evaluation finds that, while MLLM surpasses the SOTA in commonsense tasks, it significantly lags behind leading supervised models in tasks such as image classification, OCR, and VQA. Similarly, LAMM [21] uses public datasets for evaluation, expanding beyond 9 common image tasks. The research indicates that MLLMs perform poorly in large-scale counting problems, only capable of rough estimations, and also struggle with fine-grained attribute differentiation. Although MLLMs possess object localization abilities, accurately predicting bounding boxes remains challenging, which can be effectively mitigated with further fine-tuning. Considering the limitations of existing traditional benchmarks, researchers have begun to design new evaluation datasets specifically for the characteristics of MLLMs. For example, MME [24] establishes comprehensive benchmark encompassing 14 perception and cognition tasks, where the latter consists of commonsense reasoning, numerical calculation, text translation, and code reasoning. Similarly, MMBench [22] features 20 distinct ability dimensions, including object localization and social reasoning. Seed-Bench [23] shares similarities with MME and MMBench but consists of lager number of multiple-choice question. SEED-Bench2 [25] further expands the QA pairs from 19K to 24K, covering 27 evaluation dimensions. MMT-Bench [26] scales up the dataset even further, incorporating 31K QA pairs from diverse scenarios. These benchmarks highlight some common traits. For instance, the performance of models improves significantly with increasing LLM scale [22], [26]. Fine-grained perception tasks, such as spatial localization and pixel-level perception, generally pose significant challenges to MLLMs [22], [24], [26], [35]. Besides, MLLMs often struggle with understanding charts and visual mathematics, with this limitations becoming more pronounced as dataset size increases [25], [26]. The interleave-image-text problem remains difficult to resolve, with related strategies during the training phase only partially alleviating the issue [22], [26]. Lastly, with recent advancements in MLLMs, the performance of open-source models has increasingly matched or even surpassed that of closed-source counterparts [22], [24], [35], demonstrating the rapid progress of the opensource community. Real-world usage scenarios have become focal point for researchers seeking to understand how models perform in practical applications. For instance, RealWorldQA1 evaluates fundamental spatial understanding capabilities sourced from real-life scenarios. These scenarios, though relatively straightforward for humans, often challenge stateof-the-art models. Similarly, BLINK [27] identifies tasks such as relative depth estimation, visual correspondence, forensics detection, and multi-view reasoning that humans can solve within blink but present significant challenges for current MLLMs. WV-Bench [29] and VisIT-Bench [30] underscores the importance of evaluating human preferences and instruction-following capabilities in real-world applications. MME-RealWorld [35] places greater emphasis on quality and difficulty compared to its predecessor, containing the largest manually annotated QA pairs and 1. https://huggingface.co/datasets/visheratin/realworldqa Fig. 3: Illustration of three training stages of MLLMs. In the first stage, image-caption pairs are usually used for the modality alignment. In the second stage, the model is tuned on various QA pairs to make it capable of following instrctions. The third stage is responsible for making the model conform to human preferences. from self-instruction [13], [14], where data are synthesized by advanced MLLMs like GPT-4o. Given an image and an instruction, the model is trained to predict the response to the instruction, usually in conversational format. Alignment Tuning. It helps MLLMs align with specific human preferences, e.g. generate responses with fewer hallucinations [15], [16], [17]. The data used for this phase involves annotations of which response is better. This preference for response can either come from humans or from AI. The learning objective encourages response similar to the favored one while penalizing the unfavorable response."

It includes open-ended questions such as counting objects and distinguishing colors, but the answers are usually concise, such as one word. VizWiz [19] appears at approximately the time of VQA v2. It contains 8K QA pairs derived from the daily life scenarios of visually impaired individuals, effectively capturing the real-world needs of disabled users.

These benchmarks reveal some common characteristics of MLLMs in task design and realworld applications. Fine-grained perception tasks continue to challenge existing models [27], [29]. In contrast, models perform relatively well in artistic style recognition and relative depth perception tasks [27]. Additionally, while closedsource models such as GPT-4o generally outperform other models [27], [29], human performance in these tasks still significantly exceeds that of these general models. To facilitate the quantification of results, many studies simplify evaluation into binary or multi-choice problems [22], [24], [35]. However, relying solely on the corJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, NOVEMBER 5 Fig. 5: Examples of different MLLM evaluation tasks. The answer can be Open-Ended, Yes-or-No, or Multi-Choice. rectness of final answers overlooks the crucial reasoning process, which is essential for understanding models capabilities. Hence, some works directly use the openended generation results and employ LLM-based evaluators to assess the performance, although this also faces the problem of inaccurate LLM scoring. For example, MMVet [31] introduces diverse question formats, requiring models to integrate various core vision-language capabilities to provide solutions. Similarly, TouchStone [32] emphasizes real-world dialogue capability and argues that evaluating only multiple-choice questions inadequately reflects multimodal dialogue capabilities. InfiMM-Eval [33] takes comprehensive approach by evaluating models on deductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning across various tasks. Notably, it assesses intermediate reasoning steps, aligning evaluations with practical scenarios like problem-solving in mathematics. These benchmarks reveal the capacities and challenges faced by MLLMs in handling complex tasks. Closed-source models excel in these areas [31], [33], but often struggle with understanding complex localization, structural relationships, charts, and visual mathematics [32]. High-resolution data particularly helps models in recognizing small objects, dense text, and fine-grained details [32]. Additionally, while CoT strategies significantly enhance reasoning abilities in closed-source models, their impact on open-source models remains limited. In the process of development, benmarks are constantly revising and improving according to past experience. For example, MMStar [28] identifies that many existing benchmarks allow models to solve problems using only textual inputs, potentially misleading assessments of true multimodal performance. To address this, it manually collects 1.5K QA pairs strongly correlated with visual information and introduces metrics to evaluate data leakage and genuine multimodal power. CV-Bench [34] recognizes the scarcity of vision-centric benchmarks and collects 2.6K samples to assess 2D and 3D visual understanding."

            "content": "Current multimodal benchmarks increasingly focus on evaluating model performance in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, driving technological advancements in areas such as document understanding and transportation. Benchmarks have evolved from single scenarios to complex multiple scenarios. For instance, TextVQA [36] and OCR-VQA [37] focus on standard text recognition tasks, while InfoVQA [44] and WebSRC [38] introduce more intricate structural reasoning tasks, such as understanding web page structures and inferring information from infographics. SEED-Bench-2-Plus [40] and OCRBench [39] further broaden the scope of tasks by including diverse data types like charts, maps, and web pages, demonstrating that models can perform comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models in recognizing regular text, irregular text, occluded text, and artistic text. Additionally, VCR [41] addresses variants of OCR where text is embedded in images and partially occluded, requiring models to restore the specific content of the text from the images. However, many MLLMs still face challenges in fine-grained OCR capabilities, handwriting, non-semantic text, and multilingual text recognition [39], [40], [41], [175]. MLLMs like GPT-4V have shown exceptional performance in several evaluations [39], [40], [176], but still lag behind models trained specially on OCR tasks [175]. Besides, the impact of different data types on JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, NOVEMBER 2024 model performance varies significantly. For instance, knowledge graphs and maps pose more challenges than simple charts [40]. This suggests that optimizing models for specific data types or introducing professional OCR component could lead to substantial performance improvements [177]."

            "content": "Charts and documents are important data types in practical applications, designed to convey information in an efficient way. Unlike natural images, these data are highly structured and dense in information, requiring models to understand the layouts and the relationships between the embedded elements. With the purpose of developing models that can understand and reason with such data, benchmarks for different types of charts [42], [44], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52] and documents [43], [45], [46] have been proposed. ChartQA [42] focuses on VQA with charts, such as bar, line, and pie plots. The questions range from ones that demand simple data retrieval to more complex compositional ones that require both data extraction and math reasoning. DocVQA [43] is built for VQA on document images scraped from industry documents. The questions generally focus on simpler information extraction tasks. InfoVQA [44] centers on understanding infographic images, type of data designed to convey information compactly. Due to this nature, the layouts and structures of infographics are more diverse than conventional charts. Questions in this benchmark generally require basic reasoning and arithmetic skills. As MLLMs evolve, recent benchmarks shift to the understanding of more complex charts and documents. For example, DocGenome [45] focuses on the analysis of scientific papers, with tasks ranging from information extraction and layout detection to VQA and code generation.

Although the performance gap between proprietary models and open-source models is closing on more traditional benchmarks like ChartQA, DocVQA, and InfoVQA, it is still wide on more challenging benchmarks like CharXiv and MMLongBench-Doc.

MathVista [53] is an early attempt in this direction, which collates samples from existing datasets as well as newly created ones.

Subsequent works develop more challenging benchmarks [54], [55], and design more fine-grained settings for evaluation [56], [57]. For instance, We-Math [57] decomposes problem into sub-problems based on knowledge concepts and evaluates MLLMs at the level of basic knowledge concepts. To evaluate to what extent MLLMs 6 understand math diagrams, MathVerse [56] transforms each problem into 6 different versions, each of which contains different proportions of vision and text content. Overall, though some promising results are achieved by GPT-4V [53], some critical issues remain unresolved. First, most current MLLMs struggle to understand complex visual diagrams [53] and rely heavily on textual questions [56]. Second, most MLLMs tend to solve composite problems through rote memorization without the capabilities to correctly answer the sub-problems [57]."

In line with this tendency, some benchmarks for multiple images are compiled. NLVR2 [73] is early benchmark, where each sample contains pair of similar images and natural language caption. The task is to decide whether the caption is true with respect to the pair of images. Recently proposed benchmarks are more specifically designed for the evaluation of MLLMs. For example, SparklesEval [74] challenges models conversational proficiency across multiple images and multiple turns. The user prompt is presented in the flexible form of interleaved text and images. Each instance contains two rounds of dialogue with four images in total. Similarly, MMDU [72] is multi-image and multiround benchmark with maximum of 20 images and 27 turns inside single sample. There are some other benchmarks pay more attention to reasoning with multiple highly correlated images. Mementos [75] is designed to evaluate MLLMs capabilities of understanding sequential images, covering daily life, robotics, and comics domains. MIRB [76] aims to assess the ability to answer by aggregating and reasoning with information from multiple images. It encompasses four categories: perception, visual world knowledge, reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. ReMI [77] designs 13 tasks with various input formats and relationships between images, e.g. from same or different concepts. MuirBench [78] devises 12 multi-image understanding tasks, e.g. scene understanding and visual retrieval, with diverse multi-image relations like 7 multiview and temporal relations. To ensure robust assessment, each instance is paired with an unanswerable variant with minimal semantic differences. Evaluations suggest that though open-source models are approaching the performance of advanced closed-source models like GPT-4V on single-image benchmarks, large gap remains in multi-image reasoning ones [76]. Moreover, current MLLMs generally find it challenging to solve multi-image problems: even best-forming proprietary models GPT-4o/Gemini Pro only achieve 68.0%/49.3% in accuracy, while open-source models trained on single images can barely generalize to multi-image questions, reaching an accuracy lower than 33.3% [78]."

            "content": "Traditional video-QA benchmarks, such as MSVD-QA [96], TGIF-QA [97], and ActivityNet-QA [98], are generally domain and task specific. For example, MSVD-QA [97] mainly covers action and object recognition, and the answer is very JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, NOVEMBER 2024 brief. ActivityNet-QA [98] mainly encompasses videos of general human activities. With the success of MLLMs in the image realm, more and more works are devoted to leveraging MLLMs for video understanding. Along with the progress of MLLMs, more challenging and comprehensive video understanding benchmarks have emerged. Video-MME [87] is an early exploration in this regard, featuring various video domains (6 domains, 30 subfields) and lengths (11 seconds to 1 hour). The used modalities include video frames, subtitles, and audio. The videos are manually collected, and all QA pairs are manually annotated to ensure quality. MVBench [88] defines pool of temporal tasks and leverages ChatGPT to automatically reannotate existing video datasets with their original annotations. MMBench-Video [91] is characteristic of free-form questions and detailed answers for videos spanning from 30 seconds to 6 minutes. MLVU [89], LVBench [90], Event-Bench [92], VNBench [93], and the long video track of Video-MME mainly focus on long-video understanding, which challenges models capabilities in comprehension of long multimodal context. Specifically, MLVU [89] features diversified video content, video durations, and evaluation tasks. LVBench [90] selects videos longer than 30 minutes and defines 6 core capabilities for long video understanding. Event-Bench [92] pays attention to the event understanding ability with three-level hierarchy, including atomic event, composite event, and overall understanding. VN-Bench [93] designs video-needle-in-a-haystack framework, belonging to synthetic method for benchmark generation. By inserting irrelevant images or text into videos, it can evaluate tasks such as retrieval, ordering, and counting. There are some benchmarks concern more on specific scenarios and nuanced capabilities. EgoSchema [94] covers QA samples of egocentric videos. TempCompass [95] includes the evaluation of fine-grained temporal perception capabilities, such as the play speed of videos, directions of the camera or object, and changes in object attributes. Overall, current MLLMs, both proprietary and opensource, suffer from performance degradation when processing longer videos [87], [89], [90], [93], which suggests that context length may be critical factor to be considered. Moreover, open-source MLLMs perform poorly on temporal perception tasks and tend to rely on static visual cues [95]. Therefore, enhancements in temporal perception abilities are in urgent need for future works. 9 Benchmarks in this category seek to identify hallucinations more comprehensively. POPE [99] designs simple discriminative task: the benchmark gauges the degree of object hallucination by simply prompting whether specific object exists in an image. M-HalDetect [101] instead evaluates generative performance, specifically modeling descriptions on the sub-sentence level. AMBER [107] includes both discriminative and generative tasks, covering the evaluation of existence, attribute, and relation hallucinations. In line with the progress of MLLMs for video understanding, VideoHallucer [112] is proposed to comprehensively evaluate hallucinations in video understanding, covering subcategories such as object relation, temporal, and semantic detail hallucinations. Meanwhile, some works explore automatic and efficient constructions of evaluation samples, where the image is synthetic instead of natural. For instance, PhD [105], MHaluBench [186], VHTest [110], and OpenCHAIR [108] adopt text-to-image generative models, e.g. Dall-E 3, to synthesize desired images. Researchers have also developed more targeted benchmarks to probe model tendencies and categorize the causes of hallucination. GAVIE [100] observes the bias towards positive instances and introduces both positive and negative instructions for various tasks, such as attribute detection, OCR, and VQA. HallusionBench [106] incorporates control groups of visual questions for ease of analyzing models response tendencies and failure modes. Bingo [104] identifies two categories of hallucination causes, i.e. bias and interference, and designs corresponding visual questions for investigation. Similarly, VLind-Bench [115] is aimed to assess the extent to which MLLMs lean toward language priors and lead to hallucinations. These more in-depth studies have brought deeper understanding of the formation mechanism of hallucinations. According to the evaluation results, there are mainly two factors that result in hallucinations: 1) Current MLLMs suffer from insufficient visual capabilities [104], [106]. For example, MLLMs are prone to be misled by simple image manipulations [106] or leading questions [104]. Moreover, when faced with multiple images, even the advanced GPT4V struggles with discerning nuanced differences [104] or reasoning temporal relations [106], which indicates insufficient capabilities of handling image sequence. 2) Bias in models. MLLMs can exhibit varied performance for different types of visual questions, often correlated with regions, cultures, and languages [104]. This may be due to the imbalance of training data that is remembered in the model."

Hallucination is critical issue damaging model reliability and hindering its practical application. Model bias is critical issue that hinders the usability of MLLMs. Current benchmarks have explored different aspects of model bias and shed light on possible reasons. VLBiasBench [116] identifies response bias unaligned with human values. Specifically, the benchmark covers 9 categories of social biases, such as age, gender, and physical appearance. The evaluations on open-source and closed-source models reveal that the open-source models like LLaVA [187] and Shikra [188] generally show different degrees of bias, while the advanced closed-source model, Gemini [189], consistently exhibits weak bias. This suggests huge gap between open-source and closed-source models in terms JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, NOVEMBER 2024 of social bias control. Bingo [104] recognizes regional bias in the model performance of MLLMs, i.e. the models show highly varied performance when prompted with visual questions of different regional/cultural contexts. Three categories of bias are considered, including region, OCR, and factual bias. MM-SpuBench [117] probes spurious bias, tendency to utilize spurious correlations for predictions. The authors ascribe this to the learning process of models, where coarse-grained alignment between visual tokens and textual descriptions can lead to false correlations. These false priors embedded in parametric memory can interfere with predictions in counterintuitive scenarios. For example, high co-occurrences of two objects/attributes may lead to false predictions, such as recognizing scene with microwave as kitchen. The evaluation results indicate that closedsource models generally outperform open-source models. Moreover, modality alignment plays critical role in suppressing spurious biases, where better alignment techniques can improve robustness to spurious bias."

Benchmarks of this type mainly consider robustness, including Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) robustness and adversarial robustness, as well as jailbreaks. OOD Robustness. It mainly considers MLLMs ability to generalize to unseen domains, such as different styles of images not encountered in the training corpus. For example, OODCV-VQA and Sketchy-VQA [118] incorporate rarely seen images in real-life scenarios and simple sketchy images, respectively. Moreover, OOD text instructions adapted from the original questions are also included. MultiTrust [119] further considers images from other domains, e.g. MRI and infrared images. The evaluation results show that MLLMs are better at understanding OOD visual content rather than following OOD text instructions [118]. This might indicate insufficient capabilities to generalize to new instructions. Adversarial Robustness. Adversarial attacks on MLLMs aim to trick models into making wrong responses. Correspondingly, adversarial robustness is critical aspect to evaluate, which measures how robust models are to malicious attacks. AttackVLM [120] develops framework to synthesize adversarial samples and evaluate the adversarial robustness of open-source MLLMs. The evaluation results reveal the adversarial vulnerability of open-source models like LLaVA [14] and MiniGPT-4 [190]. AdvDiffVLM [121] aims to improve the efficiency and transferability for the generation of adversarial samples. Experimental results show that, compared with open-source models, closedsource models exhibit better adversarial robustness, suggesting large room for improvement. Jailbreaks. It centers on models capabilities to reject attempts to elicit illegal responses [119], [191]. VLLM-safetybenchmark [118] designs two jailbreak strategies targeting LLM and ViT respectively, to assess model resilience. MultiTrust [119] incorporates three tasks to test models robustness against jailbreaking, including 1) inserting detailed jailbreaking prompts into images, 2) combining normal textual prompts with jailbreaking prompts inserted into images, and 3) jailbreaking prompts paired with positively or negatively correlated images. These studies reveal that 10 1) compared with modern LLMs that need to be jailbroken with well-designed prompts, MLLMs are more vulnerable when simple yet harmful instructions are embedded in images [119] and 2) current tuning of MLLMs impairs safety protocols embedded in LLMs [118], [119]. Moreover, MOSSBench [122] evaluates MLLMs oversensitivity to certain visual stimuli, rejecting harmless queries regardless of the benign contexts. Three types of stimuli are included in the benchmark samples, including exaggerated risk, negated harm, and counterintuitive interpretation. The evaluation of 20 MLLMs highlights that oversensitivity is prevalent across current MLLMs, especially for those safer models, which potentially suggests trade-off between the safety and conservatism of model responses."

Moreover, even the best-forming medical-domain MLLM, MedVInT [127], does not perform so well as general-purpose models like BLIP-2 [192] (41.50% vs. 50.69% in accuracy), which might be attributed to lack of large-scale training with high-quality image-text pairs from medical domains.

Different from common tasks that are largely objective, emotion analysis entails interpreting highly subjective and emotional multimodal content, thus posing new challenges. With its powerful generalization and reasoning capabilities, MLLMs are expected to make breakthrough in this task. EmoBench [131] contains tasks ranging from general emotion and intention understanding (multiclass classification from pre-defined sets) to emotion detection in social media (binary classification, Yes/No), with data sourced from existing datasets. FABA-Bench [132] focuses i.e. on facial emotion analysis, emotion recognition and action unit recognition. The evaluation results on these benchmarks reveal that MLLMs fine-tuned with emotion-related data can achieve superior performance compared with zero-shot MLLMs, including advanced closed-source models like GPT-4V.

Remote sensing plays crucial role in numerous applications, such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, and disaster management. Multiple benchmarks have been developed to advance the understanding of remote sensing images. Early works such as RSVQA [133] builds evaluation sets in the form of traditional VQA, covering tasks like classification, object counting, and detection. The questions and answers in the RSVQA benchmark are concise and built from pre-defined pipelines based on elements (e.g. road and water area) and associated attributes (e.g. shape and size) or positional relations. The two subsets of the benchmark contain images of low resolution (256px) and high resolution (512px), respectively. More recent benchmarks enjoy wider coverage of tasks and QA pairs. For instance, RSIEval [138] manually annotates captions and visual questions. Apart from common object-related questions involving existence, quantity, or color, the benchmark also includes questions that require reasoning/external knowledge, such as What season was this image taken in?. Similarly, VRSBench [140] 11 is comprehensive benchmark that includes image captioning, visual grounding, and VQA tasks. Notably, the bounding box annotations are oriented to facilitate the evaluation of more advanced grounding capabilities. There are also some benchmarks like RSVG [136], RSVGD [137], and RRSIS-D [139] focus on visual grounding in remote sensing images, trying to locate objects using bounding boxes or segmentation masks, given natural language query. The evaluation results show that even GPT-4V struggles to handle VQA and grounding tasks [140], which suggests the necessity to inject domain knowledge into MLLMs. Moreover, specifically fine-tuned MLLMs can achieve comparable or superior performance to specialist models [138], indicating the potential of using MLLMs to solve remote sensing tasks."

Starting with the early RefExp [146] benchmark, which focuses on object localization within UI screens, the research has evolved to more complex tasks. Widget Captioning [151] increases the challenge by requiring models to generate descriptive language for UI elements, testing their perception capability. Screen2Words [147] further pushes the boundaries by demanding models to generate content and functionality descriptions for UI nodes, thereby testing their understanding of page layout and functionality. As research progresses, ScreenQA [148] simplifies the evaluation process by using only image and text inputs to focus on basic QA tasks for locating and identifying UI elements based on textual prompts. Rico-semantics [149] annotates 500K UI element attributes and relationships, enhancing the evaluation dimensions to assess models understanding of UI element shapes and semantic associations. In these benchmarks, MLLMs exhibit several notable limitations. First, at the task level, current models struggle with understanding the design of small icons and UI components specific to certain domains, and exhibit deficiencies in fine-grained spatial comprehension [146]. Particularly in the perception and localization of UI elements, existing MLLMs face significant challenges. Second, at the model level, open-source models generally perform poorly in these tasks, while proprietary models like GPT-4V show relatively superior performance. With further supervised fine-tuning on GUI data, the performance of these models approaches that of GPT-4V [196]. Lastly, at the performance level, the effectiveness of current models is highly correlated with the training data.

The advent of MLLMs offers promising avenue, leveraging their advanced understanding and reasoning abilities to address the challenges in embodied AI. Consequently, numerous Embodied AI benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the performance in areas related to embodied intelligence. The earliest Embodied Question Answering (EQA) [156] focuses on navigation and information gathering from first-person perspective within 3D environments. This approach evolves with datasets like EPIC-KITCHENS [157] and Ego4D [158], which expand the task scope to include behavior understanding, hand-object interactions, social interactions, and provide comprehensive capabilities ranging from retrospective memory to future behavior prediction.

Recent datasets such as EmbodiedScan [163] and RH20T-P [162] showcase significant increase in data scale and task complexity, focusing on 3D detection, grounding, and primitive tasks in robotics. In terms of model performance, MLLMs exhibit significant potential when handling these complex tasks [198], JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, NOVEMBER 2024 yet also reveal limitations in precise localization, spatial perception, and the integration of external knowledge [162]. Proprietary models demonstrate strong capabilities in certain visual perception tasks [198], [199], but still rely on additional modules or post-processing steps to address deficiencies in complex spatial perception [162]. For example, when using GPT-4V as planner, it encounters trouble due to hallucination issues, often requiring supplementary modules like symbolic planners [198]. Additionally, prompt design plays crucial role when employing MLLMs as planners [198], where well-structured CoT can effectively reduce perception errors [162].

These benchmarks have evolved from early simple tasks to comprehensive tasks that cover complex scene understanding and multi-step reasoning. Initially, BDDX [164] and HAD [165] focus on predicting vehicle behavior through textual descriptions and human suggestions, while understanding the underlying reasons. Subsequently, Talk2Car [166] and Rank2Tell [167] shift the focus to object recognition in driving scenes, requiring models to identify the most relevant objects based on text descriptions and rank their importance. With the introduction of DRAMA [168], research begins to address safety issues in driving scenarios by providing benchmark for risk localization and interpretation. NuScenes-QA [169] emphasizes the importance of 3D point cloud data, presenting more challenging tasks such as object counting, attribute recognition, and comparison tasks. NuPrompt [172] and LingoQA [171] further extend task complexity, particularly in 3D tracking and driving behavior inference. SUP-AD [201] introduces the need for scene-level understanding, offering not only object-level tasks but also detailed scene-level annotations to assess model capabilities. DriveLM [170] and Reason2Drive [173] enhance the evaluation of models in multi-step reasoning and interpretation, especially by simulating human decision-making processes in autonomous driving through graph-structured inference chains. MLLMs show good generalization and interpretative abilities when handling simple perception tasks such as image and point cloud data recognition [202], [203], especially in conventional driving scenarios.

            "content": "In constructing benchmarks for MLLMs, several important considerations must be taken into account to ensure that the evaluation truly reflects the models capabilities. These issues, if overlooked, can lead to misleading conclusions about models performance. Multiple-Choice Question Leakage. Many benchmarks evaluate models using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) [22], [24], [35], which are easier to automate in terms of evaluation and statistical analysis. However, this format introduces the possibility of models guessing the correct answer without truly understanding the question or image. The structure of multiple-choice questions, by nature, may inadvertently provide clues within the answer options, allowing models to game the system rather than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. To address this, some benchmarks require models to provide reasoning steps along with their answers. This ensures that the model demonstrates true understanding of the question and its components, as seen in benchmarks like ScienceQA [58] and MMEvalPro [206]. These benchmarks force the model to show how it arrived at the answer, rather than merely selecting an option. In addition, some benchmarks have designed more challenging or deceptive options to avoid trivial answers, making it harder for models to succeed without robust reasoning. Thus, the format of the questions should be carefully selected based on the evaluation scenario, ensuring that the models ability to JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, NOVEMBER 2024 reason, not just guess, is properly evaluated. Data Leakage. Data leakage happens when models are evaluated using data they have already encountered during training. The issue becomes worse when benchmarks are built from existing academic datasets, where training and evaluation sets can overlap. To this end, it is vital to minimize overlap with public datasets during the benchmark construction, especially those used for training [24]. Using new or carefully selected data can lower the risk of leakage. Besides, techniques like deduplication and thorough data checks can help spot and remove cases where the same or very similar examples are used in both training and testing. Vision-Centric Evaluation. One significant issue with many existing benchmarks is that models can answer questions correctly without even processing the visual input, relying solely on the accompanying text. This undermines the purpose of evaluating MLLMs in multimodal tasks. In benchmarks like MMMU [59], it is found that many of the questions could be answered without understanding or even viewing the image, reducing the reliance on the vision modality. To counter this, new benchmarks such as VideoMME [178], MMEvalPro [206], and CV-Bench [34] have been designed with vision-centric tasks, where the visual content is essential for answering the questions. These benchmarks focus on ensuring that the model cannot answer the question solely based on text and must integrate visual information to provide accurate responses. For example, MMEvalPro [206] uses triplet designs (a combination of an image, question, and deliberately confusing options) to ensure that the MLLM has thoroughly processed the visual input. When constructing new benchmarks, it is essential to carefully curate questions where the image significantly impacts the answer, ensuring that the model genuinely understands and utilizes visual content. Benchmark Diversity and Sample Size. As MLLMs grow more capable, the complexity and variety of tasks they are evaluated on need evolve accordingly. Simple tasks are no longer sufficient to expose the limitations of these models. Additionally, benchmarks with small number run the risk of producing unrobust evaluation results. The high variance can lead to unreliable conclusions about model performance. As such, the representative MME-RealWorld [35] presents challenging real-world scenario oriented tasks, and increases the size of QA pairs to 29K, making it the largest manually annotated benchmarks to date."

For instance, MMbench [22] and BLINK [27] use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo respectively as choice extractors. This method is useful to MLLMs that are not strong in instruction following, providing flexible alternative to match predictions and correct answers. 2) Full Model Responsibility. This approach is primarily used for open-ended tasks where the format and content of correct answers are not fixed. In such cases, LLMs/MLLMs can compare reference answers with generated answers or score directly. For example, MM-Vet [31] leverages GPT-4 to assist in evaluation, with GPT-4 automatically generating scores for each sample based on the input question, ground truth, and model output. Similarly, TouchStone [32] and LLaVAbench [14] uses GPT-4 to directly compare generated answers with reference answers. Incorporating other models in the evaluation process reduces human labor.

The role of the script is to extract and compare it with to determine whether it is right or wrong. This method evaluates quickly but also has certain drawbacks.

Accuracy [24], [34], [35], [176], [178]: It is widely used in tasks like multiple-choice QA, assessing how often the models output option matches the correct answer. F1 Score [148], [150], [161], [167]: It is particularly useful in binary classification tasks, which balances precision and recall to provide comprehensive measure of the performance. mean Average Precision (mAP) [21], [146], [149], [196]: This metric is crucial for evaluating the grounding abilities, such as accurately identifying and localizing elements within an image. CIDEr, BLEU4 [19], [147], [151], [173], and ANLS [150]: These metrics evaluate the similarity between generated text and reference text, with CIDEr and BLEU focusing on n-gram overlap, and ANLS (Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity) assessing the minimum number of edits needed to convert one sequence into another, particularly for open-ended answers. Task-Specific Metrics: Tailored metrics are employed in specialized fields. For instance, in autonomous driving, metrics like absolute error and correlation distance [164], [165] are used to predict factors like acceleration and steering angles. For object trajectory prediction, Average Multiple Object Tracking Precision (AMOTA) [172] is commonly used, while in redteaming scenarios, metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR) [118] are prevalent."

To address these limitations, researchers have developed more sophisticated metrics, particularly for evaluating tasks that involve multi-step reasoning. Some of these innovative metrics include: 16 CircularEval [22]: This metric is designed to counteract the bias that some models exhibit towards specific options in multiple-choice questions. CircularEval requires the model to correctly answer question after multiple random shufflings of the choices, ensuring more reliable evaluation of its understanding. Log Probability [25]: In situations where models ability to follow instructions is lacking, it may generate irrelevant content rather than directly answering the question. This metric assesses the log probability of the first generated token, and the option that produces the highest probability is considered the models choice. ADRScore [33]: Traditional text generation metrics like BLEU and CIDEr often evaluate outputs holistically, potentially overlooking the logical progression of reasoning steps. ADRScore is an aggregated metric specifically designed to assess the performance of models in tasks requiring chain-of-thought reasoning. Lingo-Judge [171]: This metric involves training classifier that evaluates the question, human response, and model response to determine the correctness of the models output. Studies have shown that Lingo-Judge correlates strongly with human ratings, making it robust and reliable evaluation tool."

For instance, in LLaVA-Bench [14], the authors utilize detailed prompts, instructing GPT-4 to Please rate the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and level of detail of the responses. Each assistant then receives an overall score on scale from 1 to 10. Similarly, MIA-Bench [210] adopts GPT-4o to score the responses of MLLMs for each instruction, returning total score between 0 and 10. Additionally, Bingo [204] uses human annotators to evaluate the accuracy of GPT-4Vs responses, assigning score of 1 for correct answers and 0 for incorrect ones. The reliability of this scoring strategy depends on the model or expert and whether the researchers provided detailed prompts or user requirements, and the evaluation results of different models and experts may vary greatly.

The existence of toolkits facilitate the efficient integration of multiple datasets and models, enabling simultaneous evaluation across multiple datasets while simplifying environment configuration. For the evaluation of LLMs, OpenAI introduces the Evals framework, which can test different dimensions of GPT models and allows for the creation of custom scripts for more comprehensive evaluations. OpenCompass [211], on the other hand, supports multiple evaluation datasets and models through one-stop evaluation approach, offering versatility and high scalability.

Currently, the codebase supports more than 70 different MLLMs, including proprietary APIs and open-source models, and more than 20 multimodal benchmarks covering wide range of tasks and scenarios. For the vast array of datasets from different sources and formats, VLMEvalKit standardizes the preprocessing of data and stores multimodal content using paths or base64 encoding. Each evaluation benchmark is associated with corresponding TSV file, which can be downloaded with single click and verified for integrity using MD5 checksums. Each row in the TSV file represents single evaluation sample, including index, question, answer, image or image_path and choices for multi-choice questions. Each dataset class inherits from corresponding base class, such as VQA, MCQ, Y/N, based on its question type and supports the .build_prompt() interface. The evaluation 17 scripts use this function to construct multimodal messages from evaluation samples, creating interleaved sequences of various modal contents. VLMEvalKit implements unified .generate() interface for different MLLMs. This interface accepts multimodal information, including multi-turn conversations with images, as input and returns response string. The custom processing of multimodal information by the model is determined and constructed using the additional parameter dataset_name of the .generate() interface and the models own .build_prompt() interface. It also supports differentiated adjustments to inference hyperparameters according to dataset_name. To accelerate multimodal inference, VLMEvalKit leverages Pythons multiprocessing capabilities to support parallel inference with commercial APIs. It also fully utilizes computational resources to achieve multi-GPU distributed inference for open-source models. By temporarily storing results in .pkl files, the final inference results are complete and can be restored with minimal cost. For the final evaluation, VLMEvalKit additionally designs an LLM-based judge extractor to assist in answer matching for MCQ and Y/N question types. This extractor can be invoked through commercial APIs or deployed using LMDeploy. For ongoing support of evaluation results, the VLMEvalKit team has established public leaderboard2. This ensures that all evaluation results are openly accessible and reproducible, providing the community with an efficient means to assess and compare the performance of different models."

Additionally, LMMs-Eval establishes unified framework encompassing various evaluation settings to achieve standardized and fair assessments. However, challenges remain, such as the high cost of comprehensive task evaluation and potential issues with evaluation dataset contamination. To address this issue, the pruned evaluation toolkit, LMMs-Eval lite, has been proposed. By utilizing greedy algorithm to solve the k-center problem, LMMs-Eval lite identifies subset of benchmarks where the absolute scores and relative rankings of models are similar to those of the full set. Correlation calculations ensure that the selected subset maintains adequate testing capability. LMMs-Eval lite encompasses 6 task categories, including 15 datasets, and employs specific strategies to aggregate the scores of each subset. This allows researchers to efficiently evaluate model performance during the training phase. Traditional evaluation benchmarks use fixed questions and answers for static assessment, which do not align with real-world usage scenarios. While benchmarks like VibeEval [216] and LLaVA-Bench (Wilder) [179] utilize realworld data to test model capabilities, the continuous updating of training data makes data contamination inevitable. 2. https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, NOVEMBER 2024 Fig. 7: Major components and evaluation pipeline of the toolkit.

To address the previous inconsistencies in action spaces and observation spaces, AgentStudio provides unified framework. It supports function calls and mouse/keyboard controls to manipulate any software and allows agents to use tools to access the internal structured state of programs like HTML. This avoids the limitations of single observation methods and promotes research on multimodal agent observation. AgentStudio also features visual interface to monitor agent behavior and supports fully online, interactive environments, reflecting the complexity of real-world scenarios more accurately. Additionally, AgentStudio offers an interactive annotation pipeline for labeling GUI-based data to evaluate the fundamental capabilities of models.

This creates discernible gap between evaluation methodologies and real-world application scenarios. Moreover, optimizing models based on objective assessment results often leads developers to incorporate an abundance of objective question corpus during instruction tuning, potentially compromising the quality of actual dialogue experiences. Although subjective multimodal evaluation platforms such as WildVision [29] and OpenCompass MultiModal Arena3 have emerged, more research is needed to develop assessment methods that align more closely with practical usage scenarios. Current evaluation strategies largely rely on collecting or crafting specific questions to assess particular capabilities. However, complex multi-modal problems typically require the integration of multiple skills. For example, chart-related question may involve OCR, spatial relationship recognition, reasoning, and calculations. The lack of decoupled assessment [219] for these distinct capabilities represents significant limitation in current evaluation frameworks. Furthermore, existing multimodal evaluations do not adequately cover crucial abilities, such as instruction following, with only few benchmarks such as VisIT-Bench [30] and MIA-Bench [70] addressing this aspect. Multiturn dialogue, the primary mode of human interaction with multimodal models, remains weakness for most current models, and the corresponding evaluations are still in their infancy, such as ConvBench [71] and MMDU [72]. In the realm of complex multimodal reasoning, current evaluations predominantly focus on solving mathematical [53], [54], [56] and examination problems [59], [61], necessitating improvements in both difficulty and alignment with everyday use cases.
