Mark Twain World exploration and interaction form the foundation of humankinds odyssey, which are practical scenarios for world generation models [1]. These models aim to adhere to the world laws (real world or games) while facilitating unrestricted exploration and interaction within environments. In this paper, we focus on the first act of world generationworld exploration, which aims to use image, text, or video to construct dynamic and realistic world for interactive and unrestricted exploration. Recent advancements in video generation [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] have been remarkable, making it promising approach for world generation through video generation. Meanwhile, camera-controlled video generation [7, 8, 9] is suitable way for world exploration, since camera trajectories can be converted This work was done during the internship at Shanghai AI Laboratory. *Equal contribution.

It consists of walking and drone-view egocentric videos with recorded audio. We provide rich annotations of camera trajectories, location, crowd density, scene, weather, time of day, and captions. by keyboard and mouse inputs. However, generating long and realistic videos with precise camera control remains significant challenge. Data is critical challenge. Existing video generation datasets [10, 11, 12] are not well-suited for world exploration as they suffer from limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and lack of annotations about exploration (e.g., camera trajectories) and world annotations (e.g., location, weather and scene). SEKAI (せかい, meaning world in Japanese), high-quality In this paper, we introduce egocentric worldwide video dataset for world exploration (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). Most videos contain audio for an immersive world generation. It also benefits other applications, such as video understanding, navigation, and video-audio co-generation. Sekai-Real comprises over 5000 hours of videos collected from YouTube with high-quality annotations. Sekai-Game comprises videos from realistic video game s, Lushfoil Photography Sim, with ground-truth annotations. It has five distinct features: (1) High-quality and diverse video. All videos are recorded in 720p at 30 FPS, featuring diverse weather conditions, various times, and dynamic scenes. (2) Worldwide location. Videos are captured across 101 countries and regions, featuring over 750 cities with diverse cultures, activities, architectures, and landscapes. (3) Walking and drone view. Beyond the walking videos (e.g., citywalk and hiking), Seikai contains drone view (FPV and UAV) videos for unrestricted world exploration. (4) Long duration. All walking videos are at least 60 seconds long, ensuring real-world, long-term world exploration. (5) Rich annotations. All videos are annotated with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. YouTube videos annotations are of high quality, while annotations from the game are considered ground truth. To construct the Sekai dataset, we develop curation pipeline (see Section 3) for Sekai-Real (YouTube videos) and Sekai-Game (video game videos). (1) For Sekai-Real , we first manually search and download high-quality walking and drone videos. Then we introduce pre-processing pipeline to obtain video clips by shot detection, video transcoding, and quality evaluation. After that, we develop an annotation framework to annotate location, scene type, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Considering the large amount of data and practical usage, we further introduce video sampling module to sample the best-of-the-best videos according to the computational resources for training the video generation model. (2) For the Sekai-Game s, we first play Lushfoil Photography Sim and record videos. Then we use the same pre-processing pipeline to obtain video clips. For the annotation, we develop toolbox to record ground-truth annotations while playing. We do dataset statistics analysis to show the scale and diversity of the dataset. And, we validate the accuracy of annotations for YouTube videos. Besides, we use subset of the Sekai-Real to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (ゆめ, meaning dream in Japanese). The main contribution of this work is the dataset, Sekai. It is high-quality long-form video dataset for worldwide exploration by walking or drone. We annotate diverse labels, including captions, location, scene, weather, crowd density, time-of-day, and camera trajectories for each video. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and the quality of the dataset. We believe Sekai will benefit the areas of video generation and world generation, and motivate valuable applications. We provide an introduction video on the project page. Figure 2: An overview of the Sekai dataset.

In the realm of video generation, text-to-video generation [14, 15] has played pivotal role, achieving high-fidelity results, while image-to-video generation [16, 17, 34] has also seen notable advancements. Sora [29] further underscores the significance of video generation in the context of world generation models. Among 3D scene generation methods, techniques [20, 21, 22, 18] utilize depth estimation models [35, 36, 37] to extend 2D scenes into 3D representations. 4D scene generation [24, 25, 26] further introduces dynamics, focusing on the evolution of objects or scenes over time [27] and dynamic interactions [28]. This paper primarily focuses on interactive video generation for world exploration, aiming to construct dynamic and realistic world using image, text, or video for unrestricted exploration."

Existing video generation datasets can be categorized as specific-scenario and 3 Figure 3: The dataset curation pipeline. * indicates we annotate trajectories for partial data. open-scenario. Typical specific-scenario datasets including UCF-101 [38], Taichi-HD [39], SkyTimelapse [40], FaceForensics++ [41], ChronoMagic [42] and Celebv-HQ [43]. These datasets have limited amount of data (with total duration of less than 800 hours), limited individual video duration (with an average length of less than 20 seconds), and generally lack annotation information (only few datasets, such as ChromoMagic, provide caption annotations). Open-scenario datasets [44, 45, 46, 47] have somewhat alleviated issues with data scale and annotation information. For example, OpenSoraPlan-V1.0 [46] includes videos with total duration of 274 hours, each accompanied by detailed captions. Similarly, the recently introduced OpenVid-1M dataset [10] comprises videos totaling 2100 hours, with long captions provided for each video. However, the average duration of individual videos still does not exceed 25 seconds, and they only provide caption annotations. MiraData [12] consists of longer videos with an average length of 72.1 seconds. It is still not long enough for the world exploration, and exploration annotations (e.g., camera poses or keyboard and mouse inputs) and world annotations (e.g., location, time and weather) are missing. By contrast, the proposed Sekai dataset focuses on egocentric world exploration, which covers walking and drone view videos across diverse locations and scenes with long video duration (1 to 39 minutes, average is 2 minutes) and rich exploratory and world annotation."

We manually collect high-quality video URLs from popular YouTubers and extend them by searching additional videos using related keywords (e.g., walk, drone, HDR, and 4K). In total, we collect 10471 hours of walking videos (with stereo audio) and 628 hours of drone (FPV or UAV) videos. All videos were released over the past three years, with 30-minute to 12-hour duration. They are at least 1080P with 30 to 60 FPS. We download the 1080P version with the highest Mbps for further video processing and annotation. Due to network issues and some videos are broken, there are 8409 hours of walking videos and 214 hours of drone videos after downloading. Video Game. Beyond real-world data, we collect additional data from the video game since its ground-truth annotations are accessible (e.g., location, weather, and camera trajectory). Lushfoil 4 Photography Sim is video game that allows walking or using first-person drone to explore realworld landscapes. It is built by Unreal Engine 5 and showcases the games locations in stunning visual fidelity, making it an excellent source for collecting realistic synthetic data.

            "content": "For YouTube videos, we trim two minutes from the start and end of each original video to remove the opening and ending. Then we do the following steps and obtain 6620 hours (Sekai-Real) and 60 hours (Sekai-Game) of video clips for YouTube and the game, respectively. Shot Boundary Detection. YouTube videos are often cut and stitched, and video games commonly feature teleportation pointsboth of which contribute to discontinuous shot segments in one video. Thus, following Cosmos [30], we employ TransNetV2 [48] with threshold of 0.4 for shot boundary detection. However, the original implementation runs slowly. We refactored the codebase for GPU acceleration, which is five times faster than the original version. In particular, we use the PyNVideoCodec library for video decoding and employ the CVCUDA library to offload frame operations such as color space conversion and histogram computation to the GPU. We trim five seconds from the start and end of each shot. After shot detection, the duration of video clips is from 1 to 5.88 hours. Clip Extraction and Transcoding. Considering practical processing, we split each shot into multiple one-minute clips (shorter than one minute will be discarded). In model training, we can stitch contiguous clips according to the computation resources. We re-encode each video clip using the PyNVideoCodec library to standardize the diverse codec configurations in the raw videos, targeting 720p at 30fps in H.265 MP4 format with bitrate of 4 Mbps. Evaluation of the transcoded video clips across diverse scenes yields PSNR values above 35, indicating no perceptible visual degradation. We think the world exploration should contain realistic sound. Thus, we keep the audio of walking videos. We trim the audio tracks based on the timestamps of the video clips, re-encode them into AAC format using FFmpeg at 48kHz, and mux each audio clip with its corresponding video clip. Luminance Filtering. Overly dark or bright videos are not suitable for model training. We apply simple filter based on the luma channel in YUV color space, and remove video clips with more than 15 consecutive frames of extremely high or low average brightness. Especially, this step is necessary for video game data, as the engine often employs simplified lighting and camera systems. In this step, we filter out 300 hours of videos. Quality Filtering. We use COVER [49], comprehensive video quality evaluator to filter low-quality video clips according to the technical quality metric. Technical quality evaluates issues such as image clarity, transmission distortion, and transcoding artifacts. The lowest-scoring 10% of video clips are removed after filtering. Subtitle Filtering. Some videos contain hardcoded subtitles, which are artificial texts embedded in the video frames. These subtitles compromise the videos fidelity to the real world and may introduce misleading patterns during model training. To mitigate this, we apply VideoSubFinder to detect hardcoded subtitles on the bottom one-third of the video frames. clip is flagged if it contains any subtitle that remains visible for more than 0.75 seconds, in order to reduce false positives. All flagged clips are removed, resulting in the exclusion of approximately 5% of the video clips. Camera Trajectory Filtering. For Sekai-Real, we employ state-of-the-art structure from motion (SfM) model to extract camera trajectories. However, some trajectories exhibit implausible or counterintuitive motions, so we heuristically filter out abnormal cases using the following rules. Specifically, we exclude video clips if they satisfy either of the following: (1) Multiple abrupt trajectory reversals (i.e., directional changes exceeding 150 degrees) within 10-second window. (2) camera viewpoint shift greater than 60 degrees between two consecutive frames. (3) camera position displacement greater than 5 times the average displacement of the 30 consecutive frames containing these two frames. This filtering phase is only conducted for partial data annotated with camera trajectories."

            "content": "We annotate video clips using large vision-language models. 5 Location. Utilizing the Google YouTube Data API, we fetch the title and description of each video. Since most videos contain multiple chapters filmed at different locations with timeline-based descriptions, we employ GPT-4o [50] to extract formatted location for each chapter with the ISO 3166 country/region code attached for subsequent processing. We use the interval tree to efficiently match each video clip to its corresponding chapter based on the timestamp, thereby retrieving the location information. Video clips that cannot be uniquely matched to chapter are discarded, which accounts for approximately 8% of the total clips. Category and Caption. We adopt two-stage strategy to annotate each video with category and caption. In the first stage, the video is classified along four orthogonal dimensions: scene type, weather, time of day, and crowd density, each with mutually exclusive labels. The model selects the most suitable label for each and abstains when uncertain. In the second stage, we carefully design prompts that incorporate the predicted category labels, location information, and video frames to generate detailed, time-ordered descriptions of actions and scenes for each video clip. Practically, we extract one frame every two seconds from each video clip and use 72B version of Qwen2.5-VL [51] to annotate them. We deploy vLLM [52] inference services with Nginx [53] for load balance. The final caption length averages over 176 words per video clip. Camera Trajectories. We experimented with various camera trajectory annotation methods of different types, including the visual odometry method DPVO [54], the deep visual SLAM framework MegaSaM [35], and carefully designed 3D transformer VGGT [55] that outputs 3D quantities. Through empirical experiments and comparisons, we chose MegaSaM as the baseline annotation method and made adjustments to optimize annotation accuracy and efficiency. First, we replaced the monocular depth estimation model Depth Anything [56] used in MegaSaM with Video Depth Anything [36], which performs better in terms of temporal consistency. We also tried modifying the metric depth estimation model in MegaSaM by replacing UniDepth [37] with DepthPro [57]. Additionally, we optimized the official implementation of MegaSaM to support cross-machine, multiGPU parallel inference, significantly improving annotation efficiency. We annotate over 600 hours of videos (after the sampling)."

Based on its Lua Scripting API, we develop practical tools for video collection and annotation, including the standardization of camera system configuration, real-time camera pose capture, GUI hiding, ensuring the collection of clean data with aligned annotations. The location and category are obtained from the description of the game map, and the prompt used for captioning is tightly modified to better suit the video game context.

Given the vast volume of video clips, the presence of similar video clips is inevitable. We use InternVideo2 [58] to extract embeddings for each video clip, and apply mini batch K-Means [59] to cluster the embeddings of each countryregion. Subsequently, in each cluster, we use the scores in quality sampling to rank the samples. Then we iteratively sample video clip and remove its most similar one until 1 𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 proportion of video clips have been removed. Location Diversity. We denote the number of cities as 𝑁𝑐. For each city, we count the number of video clips as 𝑁. Given sampling ratio 𝛼𝑙𝑜𝑐, we sort the cities in ascending order based on their 𝑁. For each city in this order, we sample approximately 𝑁 𝛼𝑙𝑜𝑐/𝑁 videos from each city. If it is larger than the corresponding 𝑁, we sample all video clips for this city and redistribute the shortfall proportionally across the remaining cities by updating 𝛼𝑙𝑜𝑐. Category Diversity. To ensure broad coverage across semantic categories, we perform inverseprobability weighted sampling based on four independent categories: weather, scene, time of day, and crowd density. For each category, we compute the frequency of each label and assign sampling probabilities inversely proportional to their frequencies. Assuming independence among categories, the sampling probability for video is initialized as the product of its label probabilities across the four categories. These probabilities are then normalized to sum to 1. We perform non-replacement sampling according to these probabilities until 𝛼𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒 proportion of video clips have been sampled. Camera Trajectory Diversity. We perform trajectory-aware sampling by the following steps. First, for the remaining videos, we calculate direction vector (from the start to end of the trajectory) and the overall jitter, defined as the Euclidean norm of positional variance computed every 30 frames. Next, direction vectors are discretized into bins mapped onto sphere, and jitter values are also discretized into bins. Then, joint grouping is formed based on the direction and jitter bins. Finally, we do average sampling in each joint group according to the sampling ratio 𝛼𝑐𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑟 𝑎."

Figure 4 provides an overview of the statistical information of the Sekai-Real dataset. Overall, the SekaiReal dataset includes 101 countries and regions, with the video durations exhibiting distinct long-tail distribution. The top eight countries (such as the Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom) account for approximately 60% of the total duration. From various perspectives, we categorize the Sekai-Real dataset into four weather types, four scene types, four time-of-day categories, and five levels of crowd density. Specifically, the majority of the videos were outdoors. For outdoor videos, the weather conditions are predominantly sunny and cloudy, and the dataset also includes unique weather situations, such as rain and snow, increasing the diversity of the dataset. Regarding the time of filming, most videos were shot during the daytime, followed by nighttime footage. This provides mix of well-lit scenes under natural light and darker scenes with artificial lighting, offering diverse challenges for model learning. In terms of crowd density, the distribution is relatively uniform, ranging from the sparsely populated forests of Finland to the bustling streets of Japan. This stepwise distribution covers variety of crowd density scenarios, providing diverse training settings for the model, such as curriculum learning and evaluation of video generation models under varying levels of crowd density. Figure 4: Statistical information on five dimensions of the Sekai-Real dataset. The statistics of Sekai-Real and Sekai-Real-HQ across multiple dimensions are shown in Figure 5.

Seeing Figure 5 (a), Sekai-Real demonstrates strong overall video quality scores, with more than half of the videos scoring above 0.9, while Sekai-Real-HQ exhibits higher mean video quality score and lower variance to address the long-tail distribution issue. Figure 5 (b) shows the distribution of Sekai-Reals locations. Both Sekai-Real and Sekai-Real-HQ cover wide range of countries globally. Sekai-Real-HQ demonstrates more balanced distribution, which is more effective in mitigating potential bias during model training. Figure 5 (c) shows the distribution of caption token counts in Sekai-Real and OpenVid-1M. It can be observed that the average number of caption tokens in Sekai-Real exceeds 200, which is significantly higher than OpenVid-1Ms average of around 130. Figure 5 (d) shows the distribution of camera trajectory jitter values before and after applying Camera Trajectory Diversity. We can observe that the distribution for Sekai-Real-HQ is smoother compared to that of the Subset of Sekai-Real (500 hours, before applying Camera Trajectory Diversity).
