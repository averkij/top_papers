Figure 3 Speedup of TurboDiffusion on various video generation models on single RTX 5090. For Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-720P, the latency includes the switching overhead between the high-noise and low-noise models, resulting in lower measured speedup compared to Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P. In theory, the achievable speedup is identical. Figure 4 By algorithm and system co-optimization, TurboDiffusion reduces the diffusion inference latency of Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P by around 200 on single RTX 5090. 1 Method We first describe the main techniques used in TurboDiffusion in Section 1.1. Then we introduce the training process and inference-time acceleration details of TurboDiffusion in Section 1.2 and Section 1.3. 1.1 Main Techniques TurboDiffusion mainly uses four techniques to accelerate diffusion models. First, TurboDiffusion uses SageAttention [14] for low-bit quantized attention acceleration; specifically, TurboDiffusion uses the SageAttention2++ [3] variant. Second, TurboDiffusion uses Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) [5] for sparse attention acceleration. Since sparse computation is orthogonal to low-bit Tensor Core acceleration, SLA can build on top of SageAttention to provide cumulative speedup. Third, TurboDiffusion uses rCM [6] to reduce the number of sampling steps, which is currently state-of-the-art diffusion distillation method. Through model weights merging, rCM naturally inherits attention-level accelerations. Finally, TurboDiffusion uses W8A8 quantization for Linear layer acceleration. Specifically, the data type is INT8 and the quantization granularity is block-wise with block size of 128 128. 1.2 Training Given pretrained video diffusion model, TurboDiffusion performs the following training process. First, we replace full attention with Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) [5] and finetune the pretrained model to adapt to sparsity. In parallel, we use rCM [6] to distill the pretrained model into student model with fewer sampling steps. Second, we merge the parameter updates from both the SLA finetuning and the rCM training into single model. All training can utilize either real or synthetic data. Please see our GitHub Code for more details. 1.3 Inference Given video generation model trained with Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) [5] and rCM [6] as described in the previous section, we deploy inference-time acceleration as follows. Attention acceleration. We replace SLA with SageSLA, which is CUDA implementation of SLA built on top of SageAttention. Step distillation. We reduce the number of sampling steps from 100 to much smaller value, e.g., 4 or 3. Linear layer quantization. First, we quantize the Linear layer parameters to INT8 with block-wise granularity of 128 128. Second, during inference, we also quantize the activations in Linear layers to INT8 with the same block-wise granularity and use INT8 Tensor Cores to perform the Linear layer computation. In this way, we compress the model size by roughly half and achieve faster Linear layer computation. Other optimizations. We reimplement several other operations, such as LayerNorm and RMSNorm, using Triton or CUDA for better efficiency. Please see our GitHub Code for more details. 2 Evaluations In this section, we evaluate the efficiency and video quality of TurboDiffusion. 2.1 Setup Models and baseline. We evaluate TurboDiffusion on Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-720P, Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-480P, Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P, and Wan2.1-T2V-14B-480P video diffusion models. We use the official implementation of Wan [7] (denoted as Original) and FastVideo [8] as our main baselines. Hyper-parameters. We set the Top-K ratio to 0.1, corresponding to 90% attention sparsity, and use 3 sampling steps. In practice, we recommend using Top-K value in the range [0.1, 0.15] and setting the number of steps 3 to 4 to consistently achieve the best video quality. For fastvideo, we use the default parameters in the official implementation (3 sampling steps and 0.8 sparsity in attention). GPU. Our primary inference experiments are conducted on single RTX 5090 GPU. In addition, although the speedup is not as large as on the RTX 5090, we also observe substantial acceleration on other GPUs, such as RTX 4090 and H100. 2.2 Efficiency and Quality We compare the video generation quality and efficiency of the Original, FastVideo, and TurboDiffusion. For efficiency evaluation, we report the end-to-end diffusion generation latency, excluding the text encoding and VAE decoding stages. The following figures present visual comparisons on Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-720P, Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-480P, Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P, and Wan2.1-T2V-14B-480P, respectively. Since FastVideo does not provide an accelerated Wan2.2-A14B-I2V-720P, we only compare TurboDiffusion with Original on Wan2.2-A14B-I2V-720P. From the figures below, we can see that TurboDiffusion not only achieves the highest efficiency but also maintains the video quality, demonstrating clear superiority to FastVideo. 2.2.1 Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-720P Original Latency: 4549s TurboDiffusion Latency: 38s Figure 5 5-second video generation on Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-720P using single RTX 5090.

TurboDiffusion combines low-bit attention (SageAttention), Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA), step distillation via rCM, and W8A8 quantization, together with several additional engineering optimizations. Experiments on Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-720P, Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-480P, Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P, and Wan2.1-T2V-14B-480P demonstrate that TurboDiffusion reduces the generation time of single video to <1 minute on single RTX 5090 GPU, making high-quality video generation substantially more efficient and practical. For future work, we plan to extend this framework to support more video generation paradigms, such as autoregressive video diffusion.
