            "content": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of AI evaluation, giving rise to the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm [1]. While traditional metrics fail to capture semantic nuance and human judgment remains unscalable, this new approach leverages LLMs advanced understanding and decision-making abilities to deliver near-human quality assessments across diverse domains [2]. Moreover, serving as scalable proxy for human preference, LLM judges can provide reward signals for reinforcement learning [3] and enable the automated curation of massive synthetic datasets [4]. As such, LLM judgment has established itself as cornerstone of AI evaluation and optimization pipelines, where the precision of the judge critically determines the success of downstream applications [5]. across specialized domains, the reliability of LLMas-a-Judge has become inevitably constrained [2, 6]. First, single-pass evaluators are prone to inherent parametric biasessuch as favoring verbosity or their own output patternswhich compromise their neutrality when assessing high-complexity responses that deviate from their training distribution [7]. Second, naive LLM judges are passive observers, unable to react to real-world observations; they assess answers based on linguistic patterns without verification, leading to hallucinated evaluations in specialized domains [8]. Furthermore, in evaluation tasks that require multifaceted assessment rubrics, traditional LLM judges experience cognitive overload when attempting to evaluate all dimensions comprehensively within single inference step, which results in coarse-grained scores that fail to reflect specific nuances [9]. However, as generative AI applications evolve from simple text responses to complex, multi-step tasks These limitations have catalyzed the transition from LLM-as-a-Judge to Agent-as-a-Judge. As shown 1 Survey on Agent-as-a-Judge LLM-as-a-Judge Agent-as-a-Judge Figure 1: Comparison between LLM-as-a-Judge (1a) and Agent-as-a-Judge (1b). The former performs direct single-pass evaluation, while the latter leverages planning, memory, and tool-augmented capabilities for enhanced evaluation. in Figure 1, agentic judges proactively engage in evaluation through multiple capabilities: they decompose complex objectives into subtasks, mitigate biases through multi-agent collaboration [10], ground assessments via tool-augmented evidence collection and correctness verification [8], and enable finegrained assessment by persisting intermediate states, autonomously planning the evaluation across reasoning steps [11, 12]. This paradigm shift enables more robust, verifiable, and nuanced assessments that effectively address the multifaceted nature of sophisticated AI-generated evaluands. Despite the above potentials and rapid proliferation of agentic evaluation systems, the field lacks survey to summarize and navigate this shifting landscape. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey for Agent-as-a-Judge through the following contributions: We identify and characterize the shift from LLMas-a-Judge to Agent-as-a-Judge and summarize the agentic judges development trend into three progressive stages (Section 2). sional domains (Section 4). We analyze frontier challenges and identify promising research directions, providing strategic roadmap for the next generation of robust and verifiable AI judgment."

Background gradients illustrate the coverage of developmental stages, from Procedural to Reactive and then to Self-Evolving . favor verbosity or their own output patternsAgentas-a-Judge paradigms employ specialized, decentralized agents that collaborate through autonomous decision-making [10, 13]. Crucially, this decentralized architecture facilitates the injection of expert prior knowledge: by decomposing complex evaluation goals into sub-tasks or structuring specific interaction workflows, we can enforce domain-specific constraints that generalist model typically overlooks [16, 24]. Furthermore, multi-agent deliberation ensures collective robustness; distinct roles can isolate specific information points to neutralize bias, while debate and self-reflection allow agents to audit their own cognitive shortcuts, ensuring the final judgment transcends the heuristics of any single model [62, 7]. Evolving Verification: From Intuition to Execution. Static LLM judges are fundamentally passive observers, unable to react to real-world feedback. They assess answers based on linguistic plausibility how correct response looks without verification or evidence collection, leading to \"hallucinated correctness\" in complex tasks [8]. Agent-as-a-Judge bridges this reality gap by replacing intuition with execution. By interacting with external environments, agentic judges can query system states to verify side effects (e.g., file operations) [48, 51], use code interpreters or theorem provers to validate logical consistency [37], and employ search tools to ground factual claims in real-time documentation [38, 8]. This shifts the evaluative anchor from internal model knowledge to objective verification. Evolving Granularity: From Global to Fine grained. Many evaluation tasks inherently require multifaceted assessment rubrics, yet traditional LLM judges face cognitive overload to evaluate these dimensions comprehensively within single inference step, results in coarse-grained scores that fail to reflect specific nuances [9]. Agent-as-a-Judge addresses this by transforming evaluation from single-pass inference into autonomous, hierarchical reasoning [9]. Instead of monolithic assessment, an agentic judge can dynamically select or create task-specific rubrics, autonomously planning the evaluation to examine each component of the evaluand independently [44], utilizing memory to track historical reasoning states and synthesize fragmented evidence into coherent verdict. Consequently, these agents can pinpoint 3 Survey on Agent-as-a-Judge specific flaws that would otherwise be obscured in global score, providing fine-grained feedback on each aspect [45]."

Reactive adaptive Agent-as-a-Judge enables decision-making by routing execution paths [28, 45] and invoking external tools [8] or sub-agents [13] based on intermediate feedback. However, such reactivity remains confined to conditional routing within fixed decision spaces, lacking autonomy to refine underlying rubrics.

Early systems followed Procedural paradigms with fixed protocols, while recent work evolves toward Reactive approaches that adapt agent selection based on feedback. We categorize these into two topologies: Collective Consensus. Horizontal debate mechanisms leverage agents representing diverse perspectives to counteract the inherent biases of single-LLM evaluators, illustrated in Figure 3. Early approaches exemplified the Procedural stage: ChatEval [10] pioneered this with courtroom-inspired discussion mechanism where agents debate as equals following predefined protocols. This paradigm was later extended to machine translation in M-MAD [56], while subsequent research [64] introduced explicit stances and \"judge\" roles to prevent agents from blindly conforming to the majority. Recent methods have become more Self-Evolving: approaches like Multi-agent-as-judge [13] have moved beyond static ensembles by creating domain-specific experts based on intermediate feedback. Task Decomposition. Task Decomposition employs \"Divide and Conquer\" strategy, delegating distinct subtasks to specialized agents for systematic evaluation, illustrated in Figure 3. Early frameworks followed Procedural designs: sequential approaches like CAFES [57] and GEMA-Score [24, 58] structure evaluation into predefined stages (e.g., Evidence Gathering, Reasoning, Scoring), while SAGEval [44] introduces supervision via \"Judge the Judge\" metaevaluator that reviews previous agents decisions, Survey on Agent-as-a-Judge with hierarchical approaches like HiMATE [9] organizing agents into tree structures for varying error granularities.

ARJudge [54] adaptively formulates rubrics by iteratively generating contextsensitive questions, and OnlineRubrics [55] integrates planning into reinforcement learning, evolving rubrics alongside policy optimization to detect reward hacking.

This section examines planning capabilities from two perspectives: Workflow Orchestration. Workflow orchestration in Agent-as-a-Judge systems spans from static frameworks to dynamic agency, primarily characterizing Procedural and Reactive stages of agentic evaluation. Approaches like MATEval [52] rely on static decomposition, breaking tasks into fixed sequences of sub-dimensions. While this ensures systematic assessment through predefined control flows, it limits adaptability in complex scenarios. Conversely, Evaluation Agent [28] introduces dynamic multi-round planning, where agents adjust strategies based on intermediate feedback. This system further optimizes efficiency through autonomous termination, allowing the agent to self-monitor information gain and proactively halt execution once sufficient evidence is gathered. Rubric Discovery. Unlike general agents focused on task completion, Judge Agents have the distinct capability to autonomously formulate and refine rubrics, representing hallmark of the Self-Evolving stage, where agents can refine their internal evaluation components.

As shown in Table 1, existing approaches can be grouped into evidence collection and correctness verification based on the purpose of tool use. Evidence Collection. common use of tools in Agent-as-a-Judge frameworks is to collect additional evidence that supports evaluations. Such evidence includes intermediate artifacts, execution results, and perceptual signals that cannot be reliably obtained through text-based reasoning. In code-related tasks, Agent-as-a-Judge [48] and CodeVisionary [51] allow judges to inspect execution artifacts or run automated checks to expose execution feedback for evaluation. Similar methods are adopted in multimodal settings. Evaluation Agent [28] enables judges to invoke external visual models to obtain visual quality or alignment signals, while ARM-Thinker [12] gathers fine-grained visual and contextual evidence through document access and localized visual operations. Overall, these works integrate tools to surface observable and task-relevant evidence, expanding the judges access to execution-level, perceptual, and contextual information, and supporting more reliable evaluation. Correctness Verification. Another line of work employs tools to verify whether the evaluands outputs or intermediate reasoning steps satisfy explicit correctness constraints, such as logical validity, mathematical soundness, or factual consistency.

We organize prior work into two groups: training-time optimization and inference-time optimization. Training-Time Optimization. Training-time optimization improves Agent-as-a-Judge by updating model parameters to align judgment behavior with evaluation objectives. Supervised fine-tuning is commonly used to standardize judge behavior, training models to follow explicit criteria, and produce structured judgments across tasks. For example, SynthesizeMe [46] shapes evaluation behavior using persona-guided supervision derived from historical data. Reinforcement learning optimizes judges to perform evaluation actions more effectively, especially in settings that require tool use and multi-step verification. TIR-Judge [47] and ARM-Thinker [12] train judges to decide when and how to invoke tools, integrate external signals, and verify intermediate results. Together, training-time optimization shapes internal decision processes, enabling more reliable, structured evaluation. Inference-Time Optimization. Inference-time optimization adapts evaluation behavior without updating model parameters by controlling how judgments are produced through prompts, workflows, or agent interactions. Existing approaches can be broadly grouped into two types. 1) The first type follows predefined evaluation procedures, where reasoning steps, verification routines, or prompts are fixed in advance to ensure consistency and efficiency. Evaluation Agent [28] and HERMES [37] exemplify this setting by adopting structured, step-by-step evaluation pipelines. 2) The second type allows evaluation behavior to adapt during inference, where the evaluation process, participating agents, or applied Figure 4: An overview of Agent-as-a-Judge application domains and their fine-grained task categories. criteria change based on intermediate results.

Overall, inference-time optimization enables flexible control over evaluation behavior, ranging from fixed procedures to adaptive, interaction-driven judgment.

Reinforcement learning provides natural way to acquire these capabilities, but it significantly increases training cost, especially when the judge operates over long trajectories or complex tool-calling sequences. 2) Inference with Agent-as-a-Judge is also costly. Unlike single-pass judgment, agentic evaluation typically involves multiple reasoning steps, intermediate decisions, and coordination among multiple agents, all of which increase computation per evaluation. Latency. In addition to higher computational cost, Agent-as-a-Judge often suffers from increased inference latency. Agentic evaluation requires sequential reasoning steps, external tool calls, or multi-agent communication, each of which introduces additional delays. This latency can be particularly problematic in real-time or interactive settings, such as online model evaluation, user-facing content moderation, or reinforcement learning loops where rapid feedback is required. As result, there exists tension between evaluation reliability and practical deployment constraints, where more thorough agentic judgment may not be feasible under strict latency budgets. Safety. While Agent-as-a-Judge is designed to improve evaluation robustness, it also raises new safety concerns. Tool-augmented judges may access external systems such as search engines, code executors, or databases, which expands the attack surface for prompt injection, tool misuse, or unintended side effects. Multi-agent collaboration can further amplify risks if unsafe behaviors propagate across agents or if adversarial interactions emerge. Moreover, when judge agents are used to provide reward signals for model optimization, systematic biases or errors in agentic judgment may be reinforced and amplified during training, leading to unintended model behaviors. Privacy. Agent-as-a-Judge also introduces privacy challenges, particularly in settings that involve persistent memory or personalized evaluation. To maintain consistency or adapt judgments to specific users or contexts, judge agents may store intermediate states, user information, or historical interaction data. If not carefully designed, such memory mechanisms can increase the risk of sensitive data leakage or unauthorized inference about user attributes. This issue becomes more pronounced in professional domains such as medicine, law, or education, where evaluation 9 Survey on Agent-as-a-Judge often relies on confidential or personally identifiable information. the judge refines its criteria through multi-turn alignment, ensuring higher trust and interpretability."

            "content": "Personalization. Current Agent-as-a-Judge systems are constrained by static, one-size-fits-all evaluation criteria, failing to align with diverse individual preferences. To bridge this gap, future research should focus on enhancing the autonomy and adaptivity of judge agents. critical enabler is proactive memory management: rather than passively retrieving history, agents must actively manage the lifecycle of user-specific knowledgeautonomously deciding when to register new preferences, update evolving standards, or prune obsolete feedback. This agentic control transforms memory into dynamic belief system, allowing the judge to continuously refine its criteria and maintain alignment with the users specific values and usage contexts. Generalization. Current systems rely on predefined rubrics constructed offline, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse or open-ended tasks. Future judge agents should leverage planning capabilities to dynamically discover and adapt evaluation criteria. 1) Context-Aware Rubric Generation: Agents should synthesize evaluation criteria on-the-fly by analyzing the specific intent and complexity of responses, identifying relevant assessment dimensions not anticipated during design. 2) Adaptive Multi-Granularity Scoring: Rubrics should dynamically scale based on task difficultyapplying high-level holistic criteria for straightforward tasks, while decomposing into fine-grained sub-rubrics for complex workflows. Interactivity. Current systems operate as passive, one-way observers. Future agents should evolve into interactive evaluators that actively engage with both the environment and human stakeholders. 1) Interactive Environmental Feedback: Instead of static test suites, judge agents should dynamically tailor evaluation trajectoriesautonomously escalating task complexity or isolating edge cases to rigorously probe the evaluands failure boundaries. 2) Human-Agent Collaborative Calibration: To address subjective or ambiguity-rich scenarios, agents should leverage human-in-the-loop mechanisms. By proactively consulting experts to verify intent or resolve conflicts, Optimization. Current approaches predominantly rely on inference-time engineering, which is fundamentally bottlenecked by the fixed capabilities of frozen backbones. To transcend these limits, the field must pivot towards Training-based Optimization. This paradigm shift entails two key levels: 1) Individual Capability: Utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) to internalize complex agentic behaviorssuch as sequential planning and adaptive tool usethat are difficult to elicit via prompting alone. 2) Learned Coordination: Extending optimization to multi-agent settings. Rather than ad-hoc inference collaboration, agents should be trained with joint objectives to intrinsically learn effective communication and consensus strategies. Concluding Remarks: Towards True Autonomy. As characterized in Section 2, existing implementations exhibit varying degrees of agency. The future directions discussed abovepersonalization, generalization, interactivity, and optimizationcollectively point towards an evolutionary trajectory towards autonomy. The next generation of judge agents must transcend fixed protocols to become genuinely agentic entities capable of self-directed adaptation, active context curation, and continuous self-refinement, ultimately realizing the full potential of agents that actively perceive, reason, and evolve alongside the models they assess."

We established novel taxonomy and demonstrated how agentic capabilities, including multi-agent collaboration, autonomous planning, tool integration, and memory, overcome the limitations of naive LLM judges to deliver more robust, verifiable and nuanced judgments across general and professional domains. While promising, this evolution presents challenges in computational cost, latency, safety, and privacy. Future progress should prioritize personalization, generalization, and optimization, ultimately realizing truly autonomous evaluators that continuously adapt to the evolving AI landscape. 10 Survey on Agent-as-a-Judge"

As pioneering survey exploring the evolution of Agent-asa-Judge, this study faces the challenge that the field has not yet gained complete widespread recognition in academia. Although the transition from LLM-as-aJudge to Agent-as-a-Judge has begun to take shape, there is still lack of long-term consensus regarding the definition of evaluation agents. Nevertheless, establishing this foundational framework is essential to orienting future research. We are committed to iteratively refining this taxonomy as the paradigm matures and gains broader recognition. Inclusion of Early Prompting Methods. We acknowledge potential gap between early methodologies and the increasingly rigorous definitions of agents. Many pioneering works in automated evaluation, though named as \"agent\", rely heavily on prompting engineering, such as fixed role-play, which may not align with the strict criteria for autonomy, dynamic planning, or tool-use held by the current community. Nevertheless, we deliberately include these prompt-based frameworks as they represent the initial shift from monolithic inference toward dynamic decomposition and self-evolving systems. Excluding them would obscure the transition thus compromising complete understanding of the fields evolution."
