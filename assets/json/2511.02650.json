            "content": "Recently, large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across wide range of multimodal tasks. These models are typically built upon pre-trained large language models (LLMs) by integrating visual encoders (e.g., CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), CoCa (Yu et al., 2022)) and lightweight adapter modules. The visual encoders transform images into sequences of visual tokens, while the adapters bridge these visual representations with the textual space, enabling seamless multimodal understanding and reasoning. Representative LMMs follow two main adapter paradigms: BLIP-style models that rely on cross-modal attention and LLaVA-style models that concatenate ViT patch tokens into the LLM context with MLPl layers. These approaches, exemplified by LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023a), Qwen-VL (Yang et al., 2024), and Intern-VL (Zhu et al., 2025), have achieved strong performance in visual question answering (VQA), grounding, and multimodal reasoning. However, incorporating visual inputs into LMMs inevitably introduces large number of visual tokens, leading to substantial redundancy and creating strong demand for faster inference (Vasu et al., 2025; Wen et al., 2025a). Unlike text tokens, which are semantically dense, visual tokens are often redundant and highly correlated(Bi et al., 2025b). Directly appending hundreds of tokens per image leads to steep increases in computation, memory usage, and inference latency, posing severe * Equal Contribution. Corresponding Author."

Moreover, for many vision-language tasks such as VQA, it is unnecessary to process the entire image. Only subset of task-relevant regions needs to be considered, further highlighting the inefficiency of uniform dense tokenization. To address this, visual token compression has emerged as promising direction. Recent work explores token pruning and merging to reduce redundancy while preserving essential semantics. For example, FastV (Vasu et al., 2025) prunes tokens with low attention scores, PyramidDrop (Xing et al., 2024) shrinks sequences in layer-wise schedule. Such methods reduce computation and memory and are compatible with existing LMMs due to their ability to process variable-length inputs. Despite these advances, existing token compression methods lack fair and systematic evaluation: 1) Limited coverage of methods, model series, and downstream tasks: Most prior work evaluates only small subset of compression algorithms on narrow set of datasets, preventing comprehensive understanding across different downstream task scenarios. 2) Absence of standardized evaluation protocols: Current studies adopt heterogeneous frameworks, such as LLaVA native eval, LMMS-Eval (Zhang et al., 2024), and VLMEvalKit (Duan et al., 2024b), with inconsistent prompt templates, scoring metrics, and token retention ratios. These inconsistencies make it difficult to reliably compare methods and reproduce reported results. 3) Neglect of system-level metrics and low modularity: Evaluations typically focus on task accuracy while ignoring important metrics such as runtime and end-to-end latency. In addition, many pruning implementations are tightly coupled to specific architectures, limiting their flexibility and making it challenging to extend them to emerging multimodal models. These limitations highlight the need for unified, extensible, and user-friendly benchmark to enable fair and reproducible evaluation of token compression methods for multimodal LLMs. in this paper, we introduce the Unified Visual Token Pruning Benchmark To achieve this, (UniPruneBench), benchmark designed to systematically evaluate plug-and-play visual token compression algorithms. As shown in Fig 1, UniPruneBench is standardized evaluation benchmark that offers fair and unified platform for comparing visual token pruning techniques. In addition, it provides modular and user-friendly interface that decouples pruning logic from model architecture, enabling seamless integration with various LMMs. Specifically, UniPruneBench provides (1) diverse and challenging benchmark spanning six ability dimensions (e.g., comprehensive understanding, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and hallucination) across ten datasets. (2) It categorizes existing plug-and-play token compression methods into three types: ViT-only, LLM-only, and hybrid, based on where token pruning is applied, and offers comprehensive evaluations of ten representative algorithms. Besides, (3) it conducts experiments on three series of large multimodal models: LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. In addition to measuring performance drop, (4) the benchmark also reports system-level metrics, including total running time, prefilling time, providing holistic view of both accuracy and efficiency. Through extensive experiments, UniPruneBench reveals key observations: (1). Random pruning is surprisingly strong baseline. Despite its simplicity, random pruning often surpasses existing designed strategies, highlighting the need for stronger baselines; (2). No single method dominates across scenarios. Different methods excel under different models, pruning ratios, and datasets;"

            "title": "2.1 LARGE MULTIMODAL MODEL",
            "content": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have brought significant breakthroughs in integrating vision and language, enabling models to perform complex cross-modal understanding and reasoning tasks. typical end-to-end LMM consists of three major components: language encoder, vision encoder, and cross-modal interaction module (Caffagni et al., 2024). The language encoder is usually adapted from large language models like LLaMA (Grattafiori et al., 2024; Touvron et al., 2023) and Qwen (Yang et al., 2024), while the vision encoder often adopts architectures such as Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). The cross-modality module connects the two modalities, allowing language models to process visual inputs effectively. Based on this architecture, various LMMs have been developed with different design choices and training strategies. For instance, Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) introduces visual receptor and follows structured multi-stage training process. Intern-VL3 (Chen et al., 2024b) adopts joint multimodal pretraining across large-scale datasets, while LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023a) and its successor LLaVA-OneVision (Li et al., 2025) focus on enhancing visual grounding and reasoning through taskaligned training with MLP layer. These approaches collectively push the limits of vision-language alignment, leading to strong performance across variety of multimodal benchmarks (Kil et al., 2024; Huang & Zhang, 2024). In addition, recent work explores the use of LLM agents equipped with visual tools (Gao et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024; Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023; Bi et al., 2025c) to handle more dynamic and interactive multimodal tasks. However, such agent-based methods go beyond the scope of this paper, which focuses on the architectural and training advances of the agent framework."

            "content": "LMM pruning aims to reduce redundant tokens while preserving model performance. Especially, The number of visual tokens is usually tens to hundreds of times that of language tokens, and visual signals are inherently more sparse, thus needing to be pruned. As shown in Fig 2, Existing plug-andplay methods can be divided into three categories according to where to prune: ViT-only method (Bolya et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2025), LLM-only method (Wen et al., 2025b; Ye et al., 2025) , and Hybrid based method (Zhang et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024a). Besides, one very basic method, i.e., random token pruning, is also adopted as strong baseline. ViT-only methods: Token pruning in ViTs is achieved through two paradigms: token selection and token merging. For token selection, DivPrune (Alvar et al., 2025) formulates pruning as subset selection problem that maximizes diversity, thus reducing redundancy while preserving representative information. G-Prune (Jiang et al., 2025) iteratively updates importance scores via information"

LLaVA-PruMerge (Shang et al., 2024) further optimizes token processing in the CLIP image encoder through an adaptive token merging strategy. LLM-only methods: These approaches prune visual tokens within the LLM to reduce computation while maintaining performance. FastV (Chen et al., 2024a) makes an early attempt by discarding tokens after the second layer of LMMs. VTW (Lin et al., 2025) argues that tokens can be entirely removed once the model reaches sufficient depth. DART (Wen et al., 2025b) selects small set of pivot tokens and removes others with high redundancy. Hybrid methods: Multi-stage hybrid pruning combines strategies across different components of LMMs. SparseVLM uses rank-based strategy to set sparsification ratios adaptively and recycles pruned tokens into compact representations (Zhang et al., 2025). MustDrop evaluates token importance across visual encoding, prefill, and decode, applying stage-specific strategies to remove redundancy and reduce computation (Liu et al., 2024a)."

These models align vision and language by integrating advanced visual and textual components. Typically, visual encoder (e.g., CLIP) processes image inputs, while large language model (e.g., Qwen) handles textual inputs. The extracted features are then fused via Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) connectors, enabling effective multimodal reasoning and alignment.

For benchmark execution across baselines and models, we employed the open-source toolkit VLMEvalKit (Duan et al., 2024a). Unless otherwise specified, all results are reported with batch size of 1. We evaluate performance under different pruning ratios, ensuring that pruned models maintain sufficiently high accuracy for meaningful comparison with baselines. To enable fair comparisons across benchmarks of varying scales, we report both average accuracy and relative performance. To ensure fair comparison across all Intra-LLM pruning strategies, we fix the pruning location inside the large model at layer = 2 for every method. For clarity, Random-Pre denotes uniform random dropping applied to visual tokens before they enter the LLM (Pre-LLM stage), whereas Random-Intra performs the same stochastic removal inside the LLM (Intra-LLM stage); both retain exactly the target sparsity yet introduce no learned importance bias. For task performance metrics, we have normalized to 0-100 for MME to align with other datasets, with higher values indicating better results, while for runtime measurements, lower values are preferable. To simplify presentation, we adopt the following dataset abbreviations when reporting results: MMBench as MMB, Math-Vision as Math-V, SEEDBench-2-Plus as SEED, OCRBench as OCR-B, MIA-Bench as MIA, and HallusionBench as Hallus."

Based on these results, several key findings emerge: 1. Random pruning remains surprisingly strong baseline. Random pruning consistently outperforms several well-designed methods, such as GPrune, VTW, and PruMerge. On LLaVA-v1.57B, six out of eight perform worse than random pruning at 66.7% and 77.8% pruning ratios. This unexpected result highlights the limitation of current designs and suggests that more effective pruning strategies are needed beyond naive baselines. 2. No single method achieves universal superiority. No approach dominates across all models and pruning ratios. DivPrune achieves the best results on both Qwen2.5-VL-7B and InternVL3-8B under all ratios. However, on LLaVA-v1.5-7B, SparseVLM surpasses DivPrune under light pruning ratios, while DivPrune regains superiority under more aggressive pruning. This indicates that performance strongly depends on both the model architecture and the pruning level. 3. Hybrid-based methods demonstrate strong overall performance. Among the three categories of methods, hybrid-based approaches achieve the best results on LLaVA-v1.5-7B at the 77.8% and 66.7% pruning ratios, though they perform worse at the 88.9% ratio. On InternVL3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, ViT-only methods (e.g., DivPrune) consistently outperform LLM-only methods (e.g., FastV), suggesting that vision-side pruning is more effective than language-side pruning."

            "content": "Figure 3: Performance Comparison of different model sizes for InternVL3 at 88.9% pruning rate. 4. Task-level sensitivity varies: instruction following improves, while OCR degrades severely. Most benchmarks show accuracy degradation as pruning intensifies. However, instruction-following tasks (e.g., MIA) exhibit improvements in some cases. For example, on InternVL3-8B, DivPrune raises accuracy from 72.22% to 79.82%. We hypothesize that pruning increases the relative weight of textual inputs, thereby enhancing instruction adherence. In contrast, OCR tasks are highly sensitive to pruning: as more visual tokens are removed, crucial details are lost, leading to rapid performance decline. 5. Higher pruning ratios induce sharper performance loss. Light pruning leads to moderate degradation, while aggressive pruning causes substantial drops. For example, on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, the average accuracy decreases from 57.5% at 33% tokens to 50.1% at 11% tokens under random pruning. Similarly, on InternVL3-8B, DivPrune maintains 67.58% at 22% tokens but falls to 64.04% at 11% tokens. Notably, DivPrune consistently achieves the best results under the highest pruning ratio (88.9%), showing stronger robustness in extreme scenarios. 6. Consistent cross-model trends. Despite architectural differences, all three models exhibit similar behaviors: random pruning is unexpectedly competitive, OCR tasks are highly fragile, instructionfollowing tasks remain robust, and no single method dominates universally."

            "content": "Influence of model size To investigate the sensitivity of token compression techniques to model scale, we evaluate three representative methods, DivPrune, GPrune, and FastV, across two variants of InternVL: InternVL3-1B (small) and InternVL3-8B (large). As shown in Fig 3, scaling up the base model consistently yields significant accuracy gains across nearly all benchmarks under all compression methods, confirming that larger models retain more semantic capacity even after token reduction. The results indicate that larger architectures provide greater robustness to token reduction, suggesting that compression strategies should be evaluated across scales rather than in isolation. Running time Considering real-world scenarios, we also evaluate the running time of different pruning methods. We profile three nested intervals: Total time, the elapsed time to finish the entire dataset; Prefill time, the single encoder forward pass that computes keys and values for all visual and textual tokens before any decoding starts, phase that is compute-bound for the large model; and Method time, the GPU milliseconds spent only on the compression subroutine (token scoring, selection and tensor re-layout). All measurements were collected on an NVIDIA A100-40 GB GPU with batch size = 1 and three independent runs. All reported methods correspond to uniform pruning rate of 88.9% on the MME benchmark. The results in Table 4 show that the last component never exceeds 0.5s, less than 0.12 % of the corresponding total. So the cost of importance estimation is negligible. Pruning therefore exerts its effect entirely within the prefill: DivPrune and GPrune shorten it from 320 to 185 and 167 s, delivering 1.731.92 encoder acceleration and an overall 1.621.68 end-to-end speed-up versus the vanilla model. Combination of different pruning strategies To examine whether the same overall sparsity should be applied in one step or decomposed, we fix the global pruning ratio at 88.9% and realize it through two design choices: Single-stage, single 88.9% drop executed either before the LLM (Pre-LLM) or inside the LLM (Intra-LLM). Two-stage, 66.7% Pre-LLM pruning followed by 66.7% Intra-LLM pruning, giving the same compound retention. Contrary to the more-is-better intuition, Table 5 reveals that simply chaining two existing pruning stages underperforms the stronger single-stage baseline: the best solitary Pre-LLM method (64.04%) still surpasses every 66.7% 66.7% hybrid method, despite the latter retaining the same number of tokens. This outcome indicates that naıvely"

By systematically covering diverse datasets, model families, pruning algorithms, and system-level efficiency metrics, UniPruneBench addresses the limitations of prior fragmented and non-standardized evaluations. Our results reveal surprising trends, including the competitiveness of random pruning, the lack of universally superior method, and the task-specific vulnerabilities of pruning strategies. These insights highlight both the challenges and opportunities for designing more effective token compression methods.

The benchmark itself does not generate content or make decisions, and thus poses minimal direct ethical risk. However, potential considerations include: 1. Data sources and bias: UniPruneBench relies on existing public datasets, which may contain inherent biases in terms of demographics, languages, or visual concepts. Users should be aware that these biases may affect model evaluation outcomes. 2. Misuse of results: While the benchmark aims to improve efficiency in multimodal models, it could indirectly enable faster deployment of models in sensitive applications. We encourage responsible use and adherence to ethical AI guidelines. 3. User queries and prompts: Models evaluated on UniPruneBench could still produce harmful or inappropriate outputs in response to malicious or unsafe queries. The benchmark does not mitigate such risks, and appropriate safeguards should be implemented by users. Overall, UniPruneBench aims to advance research in efficient multimodal modeling in safe and responsible manner, providing transparency and reproducibility while minimizing ethical concerns."

            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly become valuable tools for academic writing and manuscript preparation. In this work, we leverage LLMs primarily for text refinement, language polishing, and structural editing of our paper. This includes improving clarity, correcting grammatical errors, rephrasing sentences for conciseness, and ensuring logical flow across sections. Importantly, LLMs are used only as assistive tools. All scientific content, experiments, and analyses are independently designed, implemented, and verified by the authors. We emphasize that LLMs do not contribute to the experimental results, numerical analyses, or core intellectual content of this work. This responsible usage ensures the integrity and reproducibility of our research while benefiting from advanced language capabilities to improve presentation quality."

            "content": "System Configuration Our codebase was implemented in Python 3.12 with PyTorch 2.5.1, Transformers 4.54.0 and CUDA 12.4. All experiments were conducted on NVIDIA A100-40 GB GPUs. Model Configuration We evaluate three representative LMM families: LLaVA-v1.5 (7B), Qwen2.5-VL (3B & 7B), and InternVL-3 (1B & 8B), all in their official HuggingFace checkpoints without fine-tuning or weight modification. For Qwen2.5-VL, we adopt the image pre-processing setting min pixels=2562828 and max pixels=12802828, These settings help the model maintain image quality while controlling computational cost and resource consumption. Method Implementation Pre-LLM pruning is inserted immediately after the ViT forward: visual features are collected, scored by the selected algorithm (Random-Pre, GPrune, DivPrune, etc. ), and the kept indices are used to rebuild shorter multimodal embedding tensor before the LLM sees any tokens. Intra-LLM pruning is implemented as per-layer hook that activates at layer = 2; hidden states are split into system, visual and instruction segments, the visual subset is pruned, and position ids, position embeddings, and the causal mask are truncated to match the reduced token count; the subsequent layer thus computes keys/values only for the kept subset. Attention weights required by attention-based methods are obtained with single eager-mode forward pass, saved to temporary file, and loaded by the prune routine, keeping the modification orthogonal to FlashAttention or SDPA code paths. All pruning decisions are executed after vision encoding and before KV-cache construction, ensuring that generation length and memory footprint shrink proportionally. Metric Calculation Task scores are produced by the official VLMEvalKit evaluation scripts. For MME, we normalise the original counts to 0100 scale to align with other datasets; higher values indicate better performance. We further compute relative performance, allowing direct comparison of accuracy retention across tasks and pruning strengths. Time Measurement Wall-clock latency is decomposed into three nested intervals: (1) totalendto-end elapsed time for completing the entire benchmark; (2) prefillthe compute-bound encoder forward pass that processes all visual and textual tokens before the first decode step; (3) methodthe GPU milliseconds consumed inside prefill by the pruning subroutine (token scoring, selection and tensor re-layout). Intervals are recorded with on an A100-40 GB, batch size = 1, and averaged over three runs."

Across both model families, we observe consistent trends that align with the broader empirical patterns reported in Section Experiments. These findings reinforce the generality of our benchmark conclusions, indicating that the relative strengths and limitations of current pruning techniques are largely preserved across architectures of varying scales and designs. Such consistency underscores the reliability of our evaluation protocol and highlights the transferable insights that can be drawn from the benchmark results."
