            "content": "Equal contribution 1 Preprint In the current MLLM safety assessment, the intent of the language query is clearly unsafe, and the visual input serves for attack purposes. However, the application of multimodal assistants introduces new safety problem, where the visual context holds crucial information affecting the safety of user queries. For instance, as depicted in Fig. 1 (left), asking model how to practice running is benign query when the visual context is clean walkway. However, if the model perceives the user is near the edge of cliff, it should recognize it is very dangerous to practice running here and highlight the potential safety risks in such an environment. To better evaluate the safety of current MLLMs in multimodal assistant scenarios, we define new safety problem Multimodal Situational Safety: given language query and real-time visual context, the model must judge the safety of the query based on the visual context. To comprehensively evaluate the current MLLMs situational safety performance, we introduce new Multimodal Situational Safety benchmark (MSSBench) with 1820 language-image pairs. To assess unbalanced model behaviors, in half of the data, the image is safe situation for answering the query, and in the other half, the image context is unsafe. Our benchmark considers two multimodal assistant scenarios: multimodal chat agents that respond to the user with their knowledge and multimodal embodied agents that take action to complete household tasks. For the chat scenario, we leverage LLMs to generate candidate activities as user intents and envision an unsafe situation for these activities. Then, the examples will go through two filtering processes: LLM automatic verification and human verification performed by domain experts to ensure data quality. Finally, we prompt the LLMs to generate user queries with the intent to perform these activities. For embodied scenarios, we first manually create potentially unsafe household tasks, and define safe and unsafe situations. Then, we collect safe and unsafe visual contexts from the embodied AI simulators. We evaluate popular open-sourced and proprietary MLLMs on the MSSBench. The results show that current MLLMs struggle with recognizing unsafe situations when answering user queries. Then, we create different benchmark variants to analyze key safety aspects of MLLMs, including explicit safety reasoning, visual understanding, and situational safety reasoning. Our main findings include: (1) Explicit safety reasoning can improve the average situational safety performance of MLLMs, but will also introduce over-sensitivity in safe situations. (2) All MLLMs perform poorly in embodied scenarios due to the lack of precise visual understanding and situation safety judgment abilities. (3) Open-source MLLMs ignore safety clues in the image with much higher frequency than proprietary models. (4) Under settings with more subtasks, the safety performance of MLLMs decreases due to task complexity. Based on our findings, to improve multimodal situational safety awareness when responding to language queries, we introduce multi-agent situational reasoning pipelines, which break down subtasks in safety and query-responding to different agents so that each subtask can be executed with higher accuracy. Our pipeline can improve the average safety accuracy for almost all the MLLMs, but the models performance is still imperfect, especially in the embodied task scenarios. To sum up, our contributions are listed as follows: We propose the Multimodal Situational Safety benchmark that focuses on evaluating the models ability to judge the safety of queries based on the situation indicated in the visual context in both chat and embodied scenarios. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-sourced and proprietary MLLMs with our created benchmark and find that all models tested face significant challenge in recognizing unsafe situations with visual context. We diagnose MLLMs performance in-depth by designing different evaluation settings to see which capabilities are the bottleneck for the models safety performance, including explicit safety reasoning, visual understanding, and situational safety reasoning abilities. Finally, we investigate the potential of breaking down subtasks and designing multi-agent reasoning pipelines for answering language queries with safety awareness."

            "content": "MLLMs for Multimodal Assistants. Recently, the development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has been driven by enabling LLMs with visual perception abilities (Alayrac et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Reid et al., 2024). These models are applied widely in various vision and language tasks. The success of the two tasks makes them very helpful chat and 2 Preprint embodied multimodal assistants in real life. The first one is Visual Question Answering (Antol et al., 2015; Marino et al., 2019; Schwenk et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2024), which requires them to respond with their knowledge and opinion based on the users question and the visual input (Dai et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023c). This enables the users to ask the MLLMs for questions about real-life visual input. The second one is embodied decision-making and task planning (Shridhar et al., 2020; Szot et al., 2024), which requires the models to plan and execute actions with visual input from an indoor environment to complete given household task (Driess et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024a). This enables the MLLMs to control robot and make it an embodied assistant. However, the improved abilities of current MLLMs on these tasks and new applications introduce new safety problems, and the safety of MLLMs under multimodal assistant scenarios has not been thoroughly studied. Multimodal Large Language Model Safety. The generative abilities of LLMs and MLLMs carry the risk of being misused to generate harmful content. Recently, lots of efforts have been put into red-teaming MLLMs (Liu et al., 2023c; Gong et al., 2023; Shayegani et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024). However, most of the current benchmarks study the scenarios where the language itself is clearly unsafe and leverage image modality as an attack to trick the MLLMs into answering unsafe queries. Liu et al. (2023c) find that using query-relevant images can attack the MLLMs to answer malicious queries. Gong et al. (2023) propose to embed malicious queries into images and leverage the OCR abilities of MLLMs to induce them to generate harmful responses. Moreover, optimized adversarial images are also used to jailbreaking MLLMs (Shayegani et al., 2023). Besides these, there were also concurrent efforts studying the over-sensitivity of MLLMs (Li et al., 2024c). Different from existing works, we first propose new safety problem for MLLMs in multimodal assistant applications multimodal situational safety. Based on this, we collect benchmark containing chat and embodied scenarios to evaluate the MLLMs safety awareness in unsafe scenarios and over-sensitivity in safe scenarios. We also investigate in-depth how far we can leverage MLLMs capabilities to improve safety performance."

            "content": "3.1 DATASET OVERVIEW Problem Definition. We define the problem of multimodal situational safety as follows: Given language query and real-time visual context , the model needs to determine safety score, denoted as S(Q, ), which represents the safety of the intent of this query in the context of the visual information . Specifically, the safety score S(Q) depends on the visual context, meaning that it should be difficult to determine S(Q) without the visual input. Dataset Description. We introduce the Multimodal Situational Safety benchmark (MSSBench) to evaluate the models ability to judge the safety of answering language query based on situation given by visual context. As shown in Fig. 3, each data instance contains language query and safe or unsafe visual context as the real-time observation of the MLLM. Our benchmark contains two different multimodal assistant scenarios: chat assistant and embodied assistant. For chat assistant, the language query indicates the intent to perform certain activity. For embodied assistant, each language query is household task instruction, and the images depict safe and unsafe situations in which to perform the task. Multimodal Situational Safety Category. As shown in Fig. 2, we develop multimodal situational safety categorization system based on the potential unsafe outcomes by answering the query. We find that many safety categories used in former LLM safety assessments (Shen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a) do not often apply to Multimodal Situational Safety, such as fraud, political lobbying, etc. Therefore, our categorization covers four core domains where the safety of the intent of the query is frequently conditioned on the visual context: (1) Physical Harm, including activities that in certain situations may cause bodily harm, subdivided into self-harm (such as eating disorders and danger activities) and other-harm (activities that could potentially harm others). (2) Property damage, defined as activities that cause harm to personal or public property, is categorized into personal property damage and public property damage. (3) Illegal Activities, encompassing behaviors that violate the law but do not directly cause physical harm or property damage, divided 3 Preprint Category I.

(4) Offensive Activities, including activities that may breach cultural or religious beliefs or cause discomfort, are categorized into cultural belief violations, religious belief infringements, and disruptive behaviors. 3.2 CHAT DATA COLLECTION We design data collection pipeline to collect queries that are safe to answer in certain situations but are unsafe to answer in others. This pipeline involves four steps: (1) generating user intented activities and textual unsafe situations corresponding to situational safety categories; (2) filtering out situations that do not meet the criteria; (3) retrieving images that depict the unsafe context to construct multimodal situations; and (4) generating user queries with the aforementioned intents after human verification. We use GPT-4o as the large language model (LLM) in the data generation pipeline to ensure the efficient generation and processing of these situation pairs. Generation of Intend Activity and Textual Unsafe Situations. Initially, we randomly select 5,000 images = {i1, ..., iN } from the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) for each situational safety category, considering them as safe images. We prompt the LLM to generate intented activities Asafe that are safe to perform in the context of the images. These activities, along with the corresponding images and safety category descriptions, are input into the LLM to generate unsafe situations Tunsafe where performing the activity can lead to unsafe outcomes. For example, in the domain of property damage, if the image Ii depicts People playing baseball on the field, possible safe activity ai is Swinging baseball bat to hit the ball while possible unsafe situation ti is Inside store. Automatic Filtering with LLM. We implement two automated filters using GPT-4o to address the issue of the LLM generating unsafe situations that deviate from the intended safety category or involve impossible activities. The first filter eliminates situations that do not meet the safe and unsafe criteria of the designated safety category. For instance, if the category is offensive behavior, scenarios such as practicing skateboarding in the middle of road are filtered out as they do not fit the category. The second filter eliminates impossible intented activities, which means that the activity contradicts the situation, such as obeying traffic lights in an image of driving on highway because highways typically do not have traffic lights. After filtering, we obtain set of textual intented activities and unsafe situations: (Afilter, Tfilter) = ({a1, . . . , aL}, {t1, . . . , tL}), where is the number of instances after filtration. Construction of Multimodal Situational Safety Dataset through Image Retrieval. We construct Multimodal Situation Safety Dataset = {S, U}, where contains pairs of activities and their corresponding safe images i. Conversely, = {(t1,i1), . . . , (tL,iL)} includes pairs where 4 Preprint Figure 3: The overall structure of the chat data collection pipeline (left) and examples of two multimodal assistant scenarios (right). The pipeline includes four parts: (1) Generating Intented Activity and Unsafe Textual Situations. (2) Iterative Filtering with LLM. (3) Constructing Multimodal Situational Safety Dataset via Image Retrieval. (4) Human Verification & Query Generation. represents the unsafe textual situations and are unsafe images retrieved based on via Bing search. To ensure the diversity and precision of image retrieval, three images are initially retrieved for each t, followed by rigorous manual selection process to identify the most suitable unsafe image. The specific verification process will be elaborated in the following subsection. Human Verification and Query Generation. While automated filters assist in the initial screening, they remain insufficient for fully eliminating non-compliant instances. To ensure data accuracy, three researchers manually validated the dataset based on the following criteria: (1) the activity must be safe in the context of safe image; (2) the activity must align with unsafe conditions in an unsafe image; (3) the activity must neither contradict nor be irrelevant to the image. Qualified multimodal data Dq = {Sq, Uq} are selected following the human validation process. To construct real-life chat scenarios, we leverage LLM to generate typical user queries with the intent to perform the activities Aint in Sq. For example, given skiing scenario, possible queries might include How can improve my skiing skills here?. Specifically, the generated queries are used to evaluate the situational safety performance of MLLMs in handling both safe and unsafe images. 3.3 EMBODIED DATA COLLECTION The collection of the embodied data consists of two steps: Embodied task and instruction construction. We mainly consider three task categories: place an {object in hand} on {receptacle} (Place), toggle {receptacle} (Toggle), and drop an {object in hand} (Drop). For each category, we can define different safe and unsafe tasks by changing the objects or receptacles in the placeholder. The environment state that determines whether the task is safe or unsafe in the Drop tasks is the object in the robots hand. In the Place task, the environment state is the combination of the object in the robots hand and the receptacle. In the Toggle task, the environment state is the objects in the receptacle to be toggled. In total, we define 31 safe tasks and 31 unsafe tasks. Then, we create 5 instruction templates for each task. In total, we have 5 (31 + 31) = 310 embodied instructions. Embodied situations collection. After we determine the {object}, {receptacle} in the task, we run ick {object}and lace{receptacle} task defined in Shridhar et al. (2020) with the determined {object} and {receptacle}. For the Place task and the Drop task, we randomly collect two egocentric images after the agent picks up the object and before the agent places the object. For the Toggle task, we collect an egocentric image right after the agent places the object on the receptacle from two different episodes. Therefore, we have 620 samples in total. One data example is shown in Fig. 3 (right).

Our dataset is balance dataset, with half of the data containing safe situations and half containing unsafe situations. The statistical details of the data in the MSSBench are presented in Table. 1."

            "content": "4.1 SETUP MLLMs. The MLLMs we benchmark include both open-source models and proprietary models accessible only via API. The open-source MLLMs are: (i) LLaVA-1.6 (Liu et al., 2023b), (ii) MiniGPT-v2 (Chen et al., 2023), (iii) Qwen-VL (Bai et al., 2023), (iv) DeepSeek (Lu et al., 2024) and (v) mPLUG-Owl2 (Ye et al., 2024). We implemented these models with their 7B version and using their default settings. For the proprietary models, we evaluated Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2023b), and Gemini Pro-1.5 (Reid et al., 2024). Evaluation. For the instruction following setting, we use GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2023a) to categorize the response generated by MLLMs into safe and unsafe categories. The categories description is introduced in Tables. 4 and 5 in Sec. A.3. Recent studies, including Hsu et al. (2023); Hackl et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2024b) have underscored GPT-4s effectiveness and reliability in evaluative roles, including safety classification. After categorization, we use accuracy to evaluate MLLMs safety performance. 4.2 MAIN RESULTS To begin with, we assess the performance of 8 leading multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on our MSS benchmark, the results are shown in Table. 2. To mimic the chat assistant scenario, we inform the MLLM that the image is its first-person view and the query is from user staying with it, see the Common Prompt in Fig. 4c. The full prompt can be found in Sec. A.6. First, common trend among all the MLLMs is that they tend to comply with and answer users queries in both safe and unsafe scenarios. This leads to high safety accuracy when the situation is safe for the users intent and low accuracy when the situation is unsafe. Second, comparing open-source models and proprietary models, we find that proprietary models perform better in unsafe scenarios, with higher frequency of detecting the unsafe intent from the users query under the current situation, and pointing out the unsafe outcomes or rejecting to answer. Meanwhile, proprietary MLLMs are not over-sensitive in safe situations; therefore, they obtain higher average safety accuracy than opensource MLLMs. Third, by comparing the performance on Chat and Embodied scenarios, we find that MLLMs all perform worse on Embodied scenarios, especially in recognizing unsafe situations. Lastly, the best-performed model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, only scores an average accuracy of 62.2%, indicating the situation safety awareness of current MLLMs needs to be improved. 6 Preprint (a) Individual performance comparison. (b) Average performance comparison. (c) Settings illustration. Figure 4: Diagnosis of different factors influencing the MLLMs situational safety performance. Besides the instruction following (IF) setting, we design four extra settings: (1) query classification (QC): letting MLLMs explicitly reason the safety of user query, (2) intent classification (IC): explicitly reason the safety of users intent, (3) IC w/ Self Cap: explicitly reason the safety of users intent providing with self-caption, and (4) IC w/ GT Cap: explicitly reason the safety of users intent providing with ground-truth situation information. We report and compare the individual (a) and average (b) performance of open-source MLLMs and closed-source MLLMs. 4.3 RESULT DIAGNOSIS We propose three hypothesis reasons that led to MLLMs poor performance on the MSS benchmark: (1) lack of explicit safety reasoning, (2) lack of visual understanding ability, and (3) lack of situational safety judgment ability. To validate these hypotheses reasons, we design four variant evaluation settings: (1) letting MLLMs explicitly reason the safety of user query, (2) explicitly reason the safety of users intent, (3) explicitly reason the safety of users intent providing with selfcaption, and (4) explicitly reason the safety of users intent providing with ground-truth situation information. The difference between all 5 settings is shown in Fig. 4c. Influence of explicit safety reasoning. To see whether lacking explicit safety reasoning causes poor performance, we design two settings that let MLLMs explicitly classify the users query or intent into two classes: safe and unsafe. The performance in this setting is shown in Fig. 4. First, we observe that all models benefit from explicit safety reasoning. What is more, the performance improvement of proprietary models is larger, which is due to their stronger visual understanding and safety reasoning abilities. GPT4o especially benefits the most from explicit reasoning, demonstrating strong reasoning abilities but weak safety awareness in the normal instruction following setting. Then, we look into the more detailed performance of MLLMs. We find that explicit safety reasoning significantly improves the MLLMs safety performance in unsafe situations, enabling them to recognize more unsafe user intents. However, it decreases the performance in safe situations, as shown in Fig. 12a in the Sec. A.4. This means that all models are over-sensitive and more inclined to think the users intent is unsafe. Secondly, by comparing chat and embodied scenarios, we can find that the improvement of MLLMs on embodied tasks is very limited, even proprietary MLLMs only achieve around 58% accuracy. This shows current MLLMs have limited safety knowledge in embodied scenarios. By looking into the models output, we find that MLLMs often make safety judgments based on non-significant visual observations. For instance, they would judge the task of placing knife on the table as unsafe to 7 Preprint Figure 5: MLLMs different errors when judging the safety of answering users query. The full prompt informing the MLLMs of the current situation is not shown due to the space limit. perform because it requires cautiousness. Also, the MLLMs sometimes can not identify the object types in the image, leading to insufficient information. Thirdly, by comparing classifying intent and query, we find that classifying the safety of intent has significantly higher accuracy for both closed and open-source models on chat scenarios. After looking into the models output, we find three main error patterns due to the task of classifying the safety of the query being more complex, with the extra task of recognizing the users potential intent. The first one is the model ignores the unsafe situation in the image. In the example shown in Fig. 5 (middle), Gemini did not recognize the scenario is in lab where eating might be prohibited. The second one is the model made hallucinates about safety, leading to incorrect safety judgment. For example, in Fig. 5 (left), Gemini thinks parking behind or in front of the car is dangerous without any support. The third one is the model did not follow the instructions to judge the safety of the users intent in the given situation. For instance, in Fig. 5 (right), llava did not judge the safety of the users query. Instead, it comments the users query in general way. Influence of visual understanding. Then, to explore whether the lack of understanding of the image content affects the performance, we let MLLMs classify the users intent with both image and self or ground-truth caption (Fig. 4c) provided as the situation description. We label the groundtruth caption manually to ensure that the caption is faithful to the image content and contains the necessary information for safety judgment (E.g., knife is in the microwave. for the task of Turn on the microwave.). For self-caption, we prompt the MLLMs with the prompt Describe the image in one long sentence. First, from Fig. 4b, we can see that ground truth caption improves the performance of both opensource and proprietary models, and the improvement on open-source models is larger. This indicates that open-source models are not as capable of recognizing image contents that influence the safety of users intent as proprietary models. For chat scenarios, visual understanding is not significant bottleneck for the proprietary MLLMs. To determine whether the lack of visual understanding is due to the weak visual understanding ability or open-source MLLMs not fully leveraging their visual understanding. We test the selfcaptioning setting and find that self-captions can improve the performance of open-source models in chat scenarios. The models outputs show that the open-source MLLMs can sometimes recognize important information in the image that affects safety during captioning but ignore it when asked to judge the safety without explicit captioning and hallucinate wrong judgment. This is potentially because the vision and language alignment of MLLMs are weaker; therefore, given novel task, open-source MLLMs can not combine information from two modalities to make correct reasoning. For embodied scenarios, we find that self-captioning decreases the performance of both open-source and close-source models. From the models outputs, we find that the MLLMss caption usually contains too much information unrelated to the task, which misleads the models safety judgment. 8 Preprint Figure 6: Workflow of our Multi-Agent framework for enhancing situational safety in user queries, incorporating Intent Reasoning, Safety Judgment, QA and Visual Understanding agents."

            "content": "5.1 MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM DESIGN We aim to leverage our analysis results to improve the MLLMs safety awareness when answering users queries. First, we introduce explicit safety reasoning, which has shown significant safety performance improvement for both chat and embodied scenarios. Second, based on our findings that more complex task settings decrease the safety judgment performance of MLLMs, we explore leveraging the multi-agent systems (Zeng et al., 2024). Specifically, we split the task of answering questions safely into several subtasks and assigned them to different MLLM agents. For chat scenarios, as shown in Fig. 6, we design four-agent framework for open-source MLLMs comprising an intent reasoning agent, visual understanding agent, safety judgment agent, and question-answering agent. The intent reasoning agent is responsible for thinking about the users intent based on their query. The visual understanding agent provides caption for the given image. The safety judgment agent will then judge the safety of the users intent based on the image and the caption. The safety judgment will determine whether the question-answering agent will answer the users query or remind the user about the safety risk. For proprietary MLLMs, due to their stronger ability to judge safety based on image content, we remove the visual understanding agent and form three-agent framework. For embodied scenarios, given the former analysis that MLLMs often can not locate the most important visual evidence, we design two-agent framework with the first agent locating the most important environment state (which object is required to be identified to ensure safety), then the second agent will reason the safety of the task instruction and generate respond by focusing on the reasoned environment state. The visualization is shown in Fig. 13 in the Sec. A.4. 5.2 RESULT AND ANALYSIS We consider two baseline settings. The first one is the setting in Table. 2, where the prompt instructs the MLLMs to answer the users query. Second, we let MLLMs perform the intent reasoning, safety judgment, and query-responding tasks in one step. The results of our multi-agent framework are in Fig. 7, showing that the multi-agent pipeline improves the performance consistently for almost all the models in both embodied and chat subtasks. In the chat scenario, the improvements of multi-agent on the open-source models are larger, which is due to the fact they perform weaker when solving all subtasks at once. We can observe that most open-source MLLMs can not improve their performance when performing all subtasks together, compared with the base setting. With our multi-agent design, most open-source MLLMs can catch the performance of Gemini, one of the closed-source models, this shows the effectiveness of our method. Preprint Figure 7: MLLMs performance on our benchmark with three reasoning settings. Base setting: without explicit safety reasoning. 1 step CoT: MLLMs reasoning the safety of user query and generating response at one step. Multi-agent: our designed multi-agent pipeline. The results show that the multi-agent pipeline improves performance in most cases. 65.6 68.7 83.4 86.0 76.1 81.7 Claude GPT4o Models Setting Setting II Setting III In the embodied scenario, the multi-agent design improves most of MLLMs. For open-sourced MLLMs, the improvement of CoT reasoning and multi-agent is smaller. This is because the weaker instructionfollowing ability makes some MLLMs unable to execute subtasks well. Also, even the performance of the best MLLM, GPT4o, is far from perfect. To investigate the reason, we perform two ablation studies on two best-performing models: GPT-4o and Claude. We replace the reasoned important environment state by the first agent with the ground truth environment state that determines the safety of task or the ground truth observation of this environment state. The result is in Table. 3, which shows both replacements improve the performance. This means the MLLMs can not correctly locate the important environment state all the time and make visual recognition errors and hallucinations regarding safety judgment. For example, GPT-4o falsely thinks the toggling of sink with knife in it could cause injury and does not see the object that needs to be dropped on the floor is cell phone. This shows that safety training in the embodied scenarios needs to be improved.

            "content": "In conclusion, this paper introduces the novel problem of Multimodal Situational Safety to evaluate the safety awareness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in scenarios where the safety of user queries depends on the visual context. By creating comprehensive benchmark containing both safe and unsafe scenarios in chat and embodied assistant settings, the study reveals significant challenges that current MLLMs face in recognizing unsafe situations when answering query, especially in embodied scenarios. Through further diagnosis, we find that enabling explicit safety reasoning and better safety-relevant visual understanding can improve the safety performance of MLLMs. Based on our experiment findings, we propose multi-agent approaches in which we let different agents perform different subtasks to improve the safety performance of MLLMs when answering users queries. Our method shows promise for improving situational safety performance, but there is still considerable work to be done to enhance the situational safety judgment capabilities of these models. First, the performance of multi-agent is still far from perfect due to MLLMss imperfect visual understanding and safety judgment abilities. Second, our multi-agent pipeline will take longer time to answer users query since the model will explicitly reason multiple steps and require multiple inputs and outputs before responding to the user. Safety alignment training has enabled LLMs to refuse malicious language queries instantly without long reasoning (Wang et al., 2024b). We believe this would also be necessary step to address the Multimodal Situational Safety problem. 10 Preprint"

            "content": "A.1 PERFORMANCE OF MLLMS IN MULTIMODAL SITUATIONAL SAFETY UNDER INTENT BINARY SAFETY CLASSIFICATION SETTING FOR CHAT TASK Open-Soucre MLLMs. In safe situations of the Chat Task, open-source MLLMs show stable performance across four categories, indicating their effectiveness in clearly defined scenarios. They reliably recognize various scenarios, as illustrated in Fig. 8a, particularly excelling in classifying illegal activities. This suggests adequate training on safety contexts, as illegal activities often provide significant visual cues that facilitate accurate identification. In unsafe situations, models performance declines significantly. However, they exhibit relatively strong performance in offensive behaviors and illegal activities, as shown in Fig. 8b, due to clearer definitions and identifiable features, allowing for accurate judgments through semantic cues. In contrast, property damage and physical harm are more complex and subtle, necessitating multimodal information fusion and contextual understanding, which complicates accurate identification. Figure 8: Binary Safety Classification of Open-Source MLLMs Based on User Intent in Safe and Unsafe Chat Scenarios (as in Chat Task, Setting II, Table 6). Close-Soucre MLLMs. In safe situations, as shown in Fig. 9a, closed-source models demonstrate stable performance across four categories though lower than in unsafe situations. This is due to their over-sensitivity to specific inputs, leading to higher misjudgment rates. Conversely, in unsafe situations, from Fig. 9b, their overall performance significantly exceeds that in secure contexts, indicating greater adaptability to risks. In these contexts, the performance of the four classification models is comparable, with property damage showing slightly better results. A.2 PERFORMANCE OF MLLMS IN MULTIMODAL SITUATIONAL SAFETY UNDER INTENT BINARY SAFETY CLASSIFICATION SETTING FOR EMBODIED TASK Open-Soucre MLLMs. In safe situations of the embodied task, as shown in Fig. 10a and , open-source MLLMs exhibit strong performance across both categories, particularly in the physical task, where the models achieve nearly 100% accuracy, demonstrating high reliability. However, the models performance in the unsafe situations drops significantly, with scores for both tasks falling below 40%. Close-Soucre MLLMs. Similar to the patterns observed in the chat task, from Fig. 10c and d, closed-source MLLMs exhibit weaker performance in safe scenarios compared to unsafe ones, indicating heightened sensitivity to instructions. In this situation, both categories perform similarly. Furthermore, in unsafe scenarios, models demonstrate strong performance, with accuracy across both categories exceeding 80% at their peak. 14 Preprint Figure 9: Binary Safety Classification of Close-Source MLLMs Based on User Intent in Safe and Unsafe Chat Scenarios (as in Chat Task, Setting II, Table 6).

Fig. 11 illustrate the prediction distributions of different open-source and closed-source MLLMs across four labels. In each figure, (a) represents the performance of various models under the multi-agent framework, while (b) reflects their performance under the multi-agent baseline, as shown in Table. 8. It is evident that the original MLLMs tend to focus more on label 2 in both safe and unsafe scenarios, as depicted in (b) of Fig. 11A-D, indicating certain degree of neglect towards potential risks in the scene. In contrast, this issue is significantly mitigated under the multi-agent framework, with model outputs being more focused on labels 0 and 1. Moreover, closed-source models exhibit more effective performance in unsafe scenarios, often providing clear warnings (label 1) rather than irrelevant responses (label 0). However, closed-source models may also display excessive sensitivity to safety, as illustrated in (a) of Fig. 11 and F. 16 Preprint A. DeepSeek B. Qwen-VL C. Mplug-Owl2 D. MiniGPT-V2 E. Claude F.

As illustrated in Fig. 14, in an unsafe scenario where the user poses general question related to sports, nearly all open-source and closed-source models provided response. Although Deepseek initially refused to answer to some degree, it eventually responded due to lack of genuine safety awareness. In contrast, the MLLMs equipped with the Multi-Agent framework effectively perceived the scene within the image, exhibited enhanced safety awareness, and refused to provide response. Figure 14: An Example of Unsafe Scenario for Instruct Following in Chat Tasks. Preprint In safe scenarios, while most MLLMs effectively respond to user queries, instances of oversensitivity can still occur. As shown in Fig. 15, where the image depicts person holding an umbrella while walking on cobblestones, the majority of models incorrectly judged the scene as unsafe. However, the models equipped with the Multi-Agent framework were able to provide the correct response. This over-sensitivity indicates that certain MLLMs struggle to differentiate between genuinely hazardous situations and harmless. In contrast, the Multi-Agent framework, through multistep reasoning and judgment, enabling the model to assess safety more accurately. Figure 15: An Example of Safe Scenario for Binary Safety Classification in Chat Tasks. 21 Preprint In the Embodied tasks, similar to the Chat tasks, as shown in Fig. 16, MLLMs integrated with the Multi-Agent framework effectively identify dangerous scenarios in the robot tasks and appropriately refuse to respond. Notably, the Multi-Agent framework exhibits heightened sensitivity in safe scenarios compared to the original MLLMs. As illustrated in Fig. 17, under the Multi-Agent framework, GPT-4o focused excessively on the spatial relationship between objects and the table in the image, which hindered its ability to perform the task effectively.
