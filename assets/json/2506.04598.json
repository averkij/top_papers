            "content": "Foundation models [1] pre-trained on generic, diverse large datasets enabled massive improvements in transfer learning, showing strong and efficient adaptability across wide range of downstream tasks not shown during pre-training. Thanks to learning procedures leading to foundation models, transferable learning can be studied across various important domains, including language [2, 3, 4], vision [5], language-audio [6], and language-vision [7]. Progress in improving learning procedures leading to stronger foundation models crucially depends on the ability to perform systematic and consistent learning procedure comparison. Usually, following 1Code for reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found in the repository Preprint. Under review. the training, various foundation models are compared via performance shown on wide range of standardized reference downstream tasks. Often, this comparison is done on only one or few selected reference model and data scales, without carefully aligning the compute put into pre-training. Further, important parts of learning procedure like training dataset often remain closed. This makes it hard or impossible to discern whether the observed model differences are due to algorithmic, dataset or due to differences in pre-training compute, or combination of them, leaving also unclear whether the comparison holds for other scales than the few selected ones. In our work, we make step towards resolving these issues by using scaling law derivation to enable systematic training procedure, model, and dataset comparison. Foundation models exhibit scaling laws [8, 9, 10, 11] that allow to determine dependence of model properties and performance on total pre-training compute from measurements on smaller scales, enabling predictions across wide scale span instead of only one or few selected points. Here, we show how using open datasets for scaling law derivation can enable model and dataset comparison that takes into account model behavior across wide range of pre-training compute budgets and across different downstream tasks, while offering full control over variations in the whole training pipeline, and being fully reproducible. We choose language-vision learning as an important setting for model and dataset comparison using scaling law derivation. Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) [7] is well-established learning procedure resulting in models that show impressive robustness and transfer capability, and are used routinely as pre-trained components in many setups such as vision-language instruction tuning models (LLaVa [12], InternVL [13], SigLIP [14]) and text to image generation models [15]. Since the first release of CLIP, many extensions have been proposed such as CoCa [16], MaMMUT [17], and SigLIP [18, 14]. These works claim more performant language-vision models than standard CLIP. However, as hinted above, it is still unclear which of the training procedures are better for what reasons, and whether claims of improving on the standard CLIP procedure hold across scales. Here, we conduct large-scale study of the scaling laws of two important procedures, namely CLIP and MaMMUT, pre-trained on open reference datasets, DataComp-1.4B [19], DFN-1.4B [20] and Re-LAION-1.4B [21], which we are able to compare via full scaling law derivation for the first time. Our study reveals that while CLIP has advantage on smaller compute scales, MaMMUT architecture shows advantage as we increase compute, as illustrated by line crossing of the scaling curves in Fig. 1, 2,3 (Sec. 3.1). Importantly, we find that the result is consistent and robust across the pre-training datasets, learning schedules and the downstream tasks used for measuring the error performance, which covers zero-shot classification, retrieval, and segmentation. Training on DataComp-1.4B leads to stronger scalability on classification, but no difference on retrieval versus Re-LAION-1.4B, while training on DFN-1.4B outperforms DataComp and Re-LAION on both classification and retrieval for both tested CLIP and MaMMUT models (Sec. 3.2). We make the results fully reproducible by using open training datasets, open-source training code for both CLIP and MaMMUT, and by providing fully detailed procedure and code for scaling laws derivation. Our Contributions. 1) We conduct first large-scale study of CLIP [7, 10] and MaMMUT [17] with dense measurements to ensure better prediction to unseen scales and valid model and dataset comparison. Measurements cover model sizes from S/32 to H/14, samples seen from 1.28M to 3B, on both DataComp-1.4B [19] and Re-LAION-1.4B [21] datasets (model sizes up to L/14 and samples seen up to 300M on DFN-1.4B [20]) and evaluating downstream performance on tasks covering zero-shot classification, retrieval, and segmentation. 2) Based on derived scaling laws, we perform model and dataset comparison. We show validity of this comparison by revealing consistent trends in favor of MaMMUT versus CLIP architecture across different downstream tasks, open datasets Re-LAION-1.4B, DataComp-1.4B and DFN-1.4B (while also showing consistent trends favoring DFN over other datasets), and scaling law types (compute-optimal and samples seen based scaling laws). Our study is thus the first to provide fully reproducible systematic comparison of important open foundation models openCLIP and openMaMMUT and important reference open datasets Re-LAION-1.4B, DataComp-1.4B and DFN-1.4B. 3) We perform the study using both cosine and constant learning rate schedules, and observe the same consistent trends, revealing that the scaling laws based comparison can be also performed with suboptimal constant learning rate schedule resulting in 98% less compute cost. 4). We provide detailed procedure to fit scaling laws tailored for model and dataset comparison, sharing our findings on best practices of scaling law derivation which include uncertainty quantification and measuring held-out points on the compute or samples-seen axis. 5) We make our study fully reproducible and release all the intermediate checkpoints from scaling law derivation experiments. For the first time, we provide an open-source implementation of 2 MaMMUT, openMaMMUT, and release openMaMMUT-L/14 trained on 12.8B image-text samples from an open dataset DataComp-1.4B, achieving 80.3% zero-shot ImageNet-1k accuracy."

The MaMMUT model is integrated into the openCLIP code base [22] to take advantage of the existing implementation of the CLIP contrastive loss and CoCa captioning loss. Key additions to implement MaMMUT were: (1) using double forward pass for the text component to perform both text encoding (without masking) and decoding (with causal masking); (2) cross-attention between image and text tokens. For an N-layer text decoder, cross-attention layers are inserted every 2 text decoder layers [17], resulting in total of [ 2 ] cross-attention layers. Training dataset & objective. We pre-trained CLIP and MaMMUT models on DataComp-1.4B [19], Re-LAION-1.4B [21] and DFN-1.4B [20] datasets. Re-LAION-1.4B was obtained by downloading the Re-LAION-2B-en-research subset of Re-LAION [21] which contained 30% dead links, resulting in total of 1.4B image-caption pairs. DFN-1.4B was obtained by downloading DFN-2B dataset [20], which also resulted in discovering 30% link rot, again providing 1.4B image-text pairs in total. CLIP models are trained with contrastive InfoNCE [23] loss (L = Lcontrastive), while MaMMUT models are trained with contrastive and captioning losses (L = Lcontrastive + Î»Lcap), we used Î» = 1 in our experiments. Model & samples seen scales. For both CLIP and MaMMUT architectures, we consider ViT-S, ViT-M, ViT-B, ViT-L, and ViT-H as vision encoders. For each vision encoder size, we also vary patch size, and consider patch sizes of 32x32, 16x16, and 14x14, leading to = 15 model configurations. We scale text encoders accordingly following previous literature [10]. For samples seen scales D, we consider wide range of measurements = {1.28M, 3.07M, 6.4M, 12.8M, 30.7M, 64M, 128M, 307M, 640M, 1.28B, 3.07B}, total of = 11 configurations. See App. Tab. 12 for full details about models and number of samples we used in our experiments. Learning rate schedule. In our experiments, we consider both cosine and constant learning rate schedulers. For cosine learning rate schedule experiments, we performed single run for each model-samples seen pair, while for constant learning rate schedule, we only need to train once for each model size. Optimization. We additionally perform hyper-parameter sweep for batch size, learning rate and warmup for each training run to avoid suboptimal solutions. We have observed that it is important, especially in small sample seen scales, as large batch sizes usually used in CLIP training will result in small number of optimization steps, making optimization suboptimal. For training, we used AdamW [24] as an optimizer with weight decay of 0.2. To avoid unstable training and loss spikes with larger models (e.g., ViT-L, ViT-H) we followed [10, 25] and used Î²1 = 0.9, Î²2 = 0.95, gradient clip norm of 1, warmup and mixed precision with bfloat16. See more details in App. Tab. 10, 11."

            "content": "We vary both model architecture size (number of parameters of both text and vision towers), number of samples seen and patch size. In general, the relationship between compute and performance follows power law: = aC b, where is compute in FLOPs [10, 37] and = arg min L(C). Since we use error rate on ImageNet-1k zero-shot classification, we follow [37, 38] and take into account the saturation (Bc) that occurs at the small compute scales due to the nature of classification tasks - the probability of predicting class even at zero-compute is determined by the frequency of this class in the test set. On the other hand, tasks like zero-shot image classification cannot be solved with 100% accuracy due to taskand learning method-intrinsic performance ceiling [38, 37]. Accordingly, we require that our scaling law functional form satisfies: L(C) > 0 (strictly positive), lim L(C) = (irreducible error), dL dC < 0 (monotonic decrease). Given above criteria, we obtain the following functional form for the error that satisfies all three (subscript specifies compute dependency): L(C) = Ac (C + Bc)Î±c + Ec, Î±c > 0 (1) For each combination of compute scale and model architecture, we take point with the minimal error rate. In previous works [39], points with minimal loss were found by binning FLOP values into 1500 FLOP logarithmically spaced intervals. We use the same approach to find points with minimal error. Therefore, we obtain mapping from each combination of number of parameters and samples seen to the compute (in GFLOPs). Using measurements {(Ci, Yi)} where Ci is compute budget (GFLOPs) and Yi is error performance, we fit the curve only on points with compute budget below threshold {(Ci, Yi), Ci < Cthreshold}. To quantify the quality of our fit, we use mean squared error on the remaining (held-out) points: MSE = 1 (L(Ci) Yi)2. i:CiCthreshold (cid:80)"

For each unique data budget D, we extract the corresponding minimal error points {D, L(D)} using the Skyline Operator algorithm [40], which selects non-dominated configurations based on error rate. To estimate the dataset size that is optimal for given compute budget, we follow the approach of [9] and fit power-law relationship of the form: Dopt = D0 a, where Dopt minimizes L(C, D) for given compute budget C. The optimal dataset sizes are obtained by identifying (C, D) pairs that yield minimal error rate under fixed compute constraints."

            "content": "We fit function that has form of eq. 1 on the obtained experimental data using methods described in Section 2.3. To avoid the confound of data repetition [41] we limit the data used for our scaling 4 law fits by selecting only models that were trained on up to 3B. In Tab. 5a estimated parameters for both models (CLIP and MaMMUT) as well as for both downstream tasks (IN1k classification and MS-COCO retrieval) can be found. MaMMUT consistently exhibits better scaling behaviour compared to CLIP. This is reflected in smaller error rates at equivalent compute budget at larger scales after crossing compute threshold that is consistently found to be between 1010 and 1011 GFLOPS across various datasets (Fig. 1, 2,3). This indicates better efficiency and generalization as we increase compute. Moreover, this trend holds across: Pre-training datasets: DataComp-1.4B  (Fig. 1)  , Re-LAION-1.4B  (Fig. 2)  and DFN-1.4B  (Fig. 3)  . Downstream tasks: ImageNet-1k zero-shot image classification (see Fig. 1 (a), Fig. 2 (a), Fig. 3 (a)) and MS-COCO image retrieval (Fig. 1 (b), Fig. 2 (b), Fig. 3 (b)), ADE20K semantic segmentation  (Fig. 13)  . Learning rate scheduler: cosine  (Fig. 1)  and constant  (Fig. 14)  . Note that on smaller scales in the lower performance range, CLIP consistently outperforms MaMMUT, which then consistently takes over CLIP at larger compute scales in the higher performance range. We validate our fits by fitting the laws only up to certain compute budgets Cthreshold and then extrapolating to larger ones. We use these extrapolated points to compute MSE, which allows us to check on quality of the obtained fits, observing that adding more points to the fit reduces MSE on held-out points and also reduces uncertainty of predictions. Detailed versions of scaling laws plots for CLIP and MaMMUT can be found in Appendix B, more details on validating fit quality are in Appendix C. As further evidence for the validity of derived scaling laws, we observe same consistent scalability trends across datasets and on further important downstream tasks, for instance on DataComp eval suite  (Fig. 11)  , ImageNet robustness  (Fig. 12)  , or on segmentation after fine-tuning  (Fig. 13)  , see Sec. 3.5. In Tab. 1 we provide predictions on DataComp-1.4B for both MaMMUT and CLIP for unseen compute budgets 2.14e+12 GFLOPs (corresponds to CLIP ViT-L-14 trained on 12.8B image-text pairs) and 2.59e+12 GFLOPs (corresponds to MaMMUT ViT-L-14 trained on 12.8B samples). We see that our predictions favor MaMMUT over CLIP. As prediction test on larger scales further away, for CLIP ViT-L-14 trained on 12.8B samples of DataComp-1.4B our prediction for ImageNet-1k 0-shot accuracy (79.6%) is close to performance of CLIP ViT-L-14 trained on 12.8B samples reported in the original DataComp work [19] - 79.2%. The measured performance is well within the prediction confidence interval (Tab. 1). Note that the measured performance IN1K zero-shot 79.2% in the DataComp original work [19] was done with heavy samples repetitions (12.8B on DataComp-1.4B is about 9x), while our prediction is done for unique or low repetition scenario, which also might explain tendency to higher performance in the prediction. In Tab. 5a we provide estimated parameters for our fits for both downstream tasks and datasets."

For CLIP, we additionally plot OpenAI CLIP models performance that were trained on the WIT-400M dataset. Using much denser measurements for scaling law derivation, we can also confirm findings from previous work [10], which showed that the closed dataset WIT-400M[7] has better scaling trend on zero-shot classification, but worse scaling trend on zero-shot retrieval when compared to LAION-2B. We observe the same for Re-LAION-1.4B, which is safety update of LAION-2B used in [10], otherwise being same dataset with less samples due to link rot [21]. This provides further evidence for robustness of scaling law based comparison, showing consistent trends despite major difference in scaling law derivation. Previous work [10] used few samples seen scales of 3B, 12.8B and 34B, which results in high repetition given that only 2B unique samples are contained in LAION-2B [42], while our work used denser lower samples seen scales up to 3B, doing derivation with unique samples or low repetition only. Despite these differences, derived scaling laws agree in the dataset comparison for each downstream task, predicting same scaling trends in favor of WIT-400M on classification and in favor of Re-LAION-1.4B on retrieval. DataComp-1.4B can be seen in this comparison as an improved version of Re-LAION-1.4B, with stronger scalability on classification  (Fig. 4)  that matches WIT-400M, while obtaining performance for retrieval  (Fig. 5)  that matches Re-LAION-1.4B, outperforming WIT-400M. 6 (a) ImageNet-1k 0-shot classification (b) MS-COCO image R@5 Figure 3: Scaling on DFN-1.4B.

For CLIP we have 3 additional points for OpenAI CLIP [7] models trained on WIT-400M dataset for reference. We also provide comparison for Re-LAION, DataComp and DFN. For DFN, we measure only up to 300M samples seen and up to L/14 model scale, therefore we base the comparison on measurements done up to compute scale of 1011 GFLOPS. As evident from Fig. 6 and 7, training on DFN1.4B provides stronger scalability and outperforms DataComp and Re-LAION for both zeroshot ImageNet-1k classification and MSCOCO retrieval, again consistently for both CLIP and MaMMUT architectures. Despite lower compute used for dataset comparison and higher uncertainty for the trends resulting from fewer measurements for DFN, measured trends are clear and consistent, allowing thus to draw conclusions favoring DFN-1.4B over other datasets in the comparison."

            "content": "We investigate additional model architectures: SigLIP [18] (CLIP with the sigmoid loss instead of softmax), CoCa [16] (contrastive + captioning loss using encoder-decoder text tower, as opposed to decoder only for MaMMUT) and Cap [43] (pure captioner). We train these models on DataComp1.4B in order to compare with openCLIP and openMaMMUT. Fig. 9 shows the fitted lines for these models. We see that CLIP and SigLIP have very similar scaling behavior on ImageNet-1k classification (Fig. 9 (a)) while openMaMMUT consistently overtakes CoCa on the same compute scale Fig. 9 (b). Notably, our analysis shows that SigLIP has similar or even worse scalability than CLIP which contradicts recent claims of SigLIP being better choice for vision encoder [18, 14] due to its architectural advantages (specifically, due to usage of sigmoid transfer function instead of softmax). Thus, when properly controlling for same training data in our experiments, no benefits for SigLIP can be derived from the obtained scaling law trends. We also observe that text decoder-only MaMMUT overtakes encoder-decoder CoCa on the same compute scale, indicating that simpler and more parameter efficient architecture of MaMMUT might be preferable. Moreover, we see  (Fig. 10)  that MaMMUT has superior scaling compared to Cap, showing that combination of contrastive and captioning losses is advantageous. We see Cap also underperforming standard CLIP, hinting that Cap as captioner only based architecture is not good candidate for strong scalability in 0-shot regimes, making another case for contrastive losses being important part of scalable architectures for 0-shot classification. It is further important to note that Cap can use only log-likelihood based evaluation for zero-shot classification task, as opposed to CLIP and MaMMUT that in addition can use embedding similarity based evaluation thanks to their contrastive loss. As evident from Fig. 10, embedding similarity based evaluation used in openCLIP and openMaMMUT has strong advantage over log-likelihood based one. It is in addition also much cheaper in execution. Cap has thus architectural disadvantage in not being able to use similarity based evaluation due to missing contrastive loss, which leads to inferior performance in 0-shot regime. For both comparisons, we see uncertainty getting high when extrapolating to larger scales, which makes it for instance hard to predict whether CoCa might still cross CLIP or not. To reduce 9 (a) CLIP vs SiGLIP on DataComp-1.4B (b) MaMMUT vs CoCa vs CLIP on DataComp1.4B Figure 9: Scaling laws for ImageNet-1k 0-shot classification, comparing SigLIP (left) and CoCa (right) with standard CLIP and MaMMUT using open DataComp-1.4B dataset. SigLIP shows no benefit over standard CLIP, contrary to claims in previous work. CoCa is predicted to be outperformed by MaMMUT. CoCa crossing CLIP is possible, hinting stronger scalability for CoCa over CLIP. This prediction is not clear due to high uncertainty for CoCa estimates at larger scales, as measurements on smaller scales for CoCa are not dense enough. Figure 10: Scaling law fit for ImageNet-1k 0-shot classification, comparing MaMMUT, CLIP and Cap (captioning only). Cap can be only evaluated via log-likelihood, which is more expensive as similarity based evaluation used by CLIP and MaMMUT, as Cap misses contrastive loss in its architecture, which makes it disadvantageous for 0-shot setting. uncertainty, it is thus important to both conduct dense measurements at smaller scales and not to cut off measurements at scales too small to be used for proper extrapolation."

This is far below the crossover at approximately 1011 GFLOPs observed for zero-shot ImageNet classification (Fig. 1a), indicating that captioning supervision via fine-tuning improves dense prediction already at lower pre-training scales.

Using our procedure, we can check such claims. For instance in Fig. 9, we compare open implementations of CoCa and SigLIP to openCLIP and openMaMMUT on DataComp-1.4B, finding no significant difference of SigLIP to standard CLIP in model scalability. We also observe advantage for MaMMUT over CoCa on same compute budget, while both architectures use the same contrastive and captioning loss combination. In [49], authors investigate how various language model families compare in terms of their scaling behavior. While it offers valuable insights into architectural trends, it does not use for comparison full scaling law framework in the sense of jointly modeling loss or downstream task performance as function of compute and dataset size varied systematically across multiple scales. As accuracy of predictions derived from such trends was not measured, it makes it unclear whether observed trends for various language model architectures are to be trusted and whether comparison would remain valid across various scenarios, which we demonstrate to be the case for scaling law based comparison. Preparing grounds for this work, [10] derived first reproducible scaling laws for openCLIP using LAION datasets and performed comparison between open LAION-400M/5B and closed WIT. The work used however only few samples seen scales (3B, 12.8B and 34B), while also going up to scales that are prone to strongly diminishing performance due to heavy sample repetition (6x on 12.8B and 17x on 34B sample seen scales). This affects extrapolations of the scaling law and thus the validity of comparisons based on it. Interestingly, in our work using much denser scaling law derivation without strong repetitions for higher prediction accuracy, we can confirm the dataset comparison in [10] using Re-LAION-1.4B, observing same trends for WIT being better on zero-shot classification  (Fig. 4)  while worse on retrieval  (Fig. 5)  , providing further evidence for robustness of scaling law based comparison. Another data-centric work responsible for composing open DataComp-1.4B dataset [19] used measurements on few selected scales to compare datasets and decide for benefit of various dataset interventions. No scaling laws were derived to back up the comparisons, leaving unclear whether the observed trends will propagate across larger scales than taken for the comparisons. Several works explored the effects of data constraints on scaling laws. Notably, studies investigating the scaling law behavior under dataset repetitions for language models [38, 41] and for CLIP[50] reported that high repetition factors can lead to heavily diminished performance compared to the Pareto front of scaling with unique data samples. Our experiments carefully limit the repetition factor 13 to less than 3, minimizing such confounding effects, assuming unique samples or only little sample repetition for comparisons to be valid on Pareto front with strong performance scaling. Building on these foundations, our work provides unified and empirically grounded scaling law analysis of vision-language models trained on open datasets. We explicitly model performance as function of data and compute [8, 9], and compare multiple architectures under fully controlled, consistent and reproducible settings. Unlike prior work, our approach enables rigorous comparison of both data and compute efficiency, ensuring the consistency of the comparison across scales and training conditions. Limitations. While our work provides comprehensive analysis for language-vision models such as CLIP and MaMMUT trained on large-scale open foundation datasets, it also has several limitations: 1) We mostly use zero-shot setting for model evaluation (for classification and retrieval tasks), using fine-tuning only for segmentation. Linear probing, fine-tuning [10] or vision instruction-tuning [12] of the pre-trained vision encoders can provide further insights into validity and consistency of scaling laws based comparison. 2) While open datasets we use have substantial scale - 1.4B unique samples - this still limits the ability of derived scaling laws to extrapolate to higher scales, as the effect of sample repetition has to be considered when conducting measurements above 1.4B. To test comparison validity and scaling law predictions on larger reference scales like 12.8B, larger scale open datasets are required. 3) In our study we only looked at standard contrastive loss or contrastive and captioning loss objectives and did not incorporate further \"loss mixtures\" such as masking or diffusion-based losses. We also did not derive scaling laws for specific architectural components such as optimal number of parameters in text or vision tower, or other important properties of training procedure like image input resolution and patch size, or context length in general. In its current form, scaling laws based comparison has high computational cost, prohibiting naive incorporation of many factors that influence scalability of the training procedure."

            "title": "5 Discussion & conclusion",
            "content": "In this work, we show how open foundation models trained on open datasets can provide grounds for systematic learning procedure comparison via scaling law derivation under fully controlled, reproducible training conditions. We take as example scenario openCLIP [7, 22, 10] and openMaMMUT based on [17] , two important open language-vision models relying either on image-text contrastive only or contrastive and captioning loss, trained on three important open reference datasets, DataComp-1.4B [19], Re-LAION-1.4B [21] and DFN-1.4B [20]. We show that deriving scaling laws gives comparison of model and dataset based on their estimated scalability for wide scale spans and for various downstream tasks, aligned on same total pre-training compute. Such comparison can be validated by checking consistency of scaling trends in different scenarios. For instance, openMaMMUT scalability is stronger than openCLIP both on zero-shot classification and retrieval, also showing advantage for wide scale span on segmentation, and across all three studied datasets DataComp-1.4B, Re-LAION-1.4B and DFN-1.4B. Also, inconsistencies are insightful - for instance, DataComp-1.4B shows stronger scalability for both openMaMMUT and openCLIP for zero-shot classification while being slightly weaker for retrieval. Thus, none of these two datasets is the most scalable candidate across all downstream tasks, and scaling advantage there is task dependent. For DFN on the other hand, consistent picture emerges: both openMaMMUT and openCLIP trained on DFN show superior performance over other datasets across downstream tasks, allowing to draw conclusion favoring DFN over other datasets for pretraining strong and scalable models. Comparison via scaling laws offers better protection against misleading conclusions derived from comparison of only few selected points, especially when done on small scales only. On smaller scales, openCLIP outperforms stronger scalable openMaMMUT that takes over on larger scales. Remarkably, we observe the compute scale threshold where openMaMMUT takes over openCLIP to be consistently settled between 1010 and 1011 GFLOPS across datasets, zero-shot downstream tasks and learning schedules. This gives further evidence for the robustness of scaling law based comparison. To properly estimate such crossings, it is crucial to perform dense measurements on smaller scales and use fitting routines that allow for accurate extrapolation to larger scales. Efficient derivation of accurate scaling laws [44, 11] for factors affecting the learning procedure is thus an important topic for future work. 14 In our study, we used open datasets with 1.4B samples. While this is sufficient to demonstrate usefulness of scaling law based comparison, more accurate predictions for training at larger scales on unique samples require larger datasets. Those are also required to train larger scale models with predicted strong capabilities, as too many repetitions on smaller datasets might lead to diminished performance [41, 50], which we see in openMaMMUT L-14 trained on 12.8B samples, staying with zero-shot IN1k 80.3% below the predicted 82% (Tab. 1). Deriving scaling law correction for diminishing performance due to data repetitions as well as increasing scale of open datasets are important directions for future work. While we show that robust and reproducible comparison via scaling law derivation is possible, it relies crucially on the whole pipeline to be fully open - including dataset composition, training itself, and downstream evaluation. We hope that our work will encourage the creation of more open artefacts, especially open datasets as those are still scarce [42, 19, 20, 21], to enable collaborative and reproducible progress towards stronger scalable open foundation models guided by independently verifiable and systematic comparison."

Estimated values of exponents in power laws alone do not tell which models are more scalable, as we use here the functional form with additive terms for both irreducible error and non-zero random model performance (Eq. 1). Apart from plot visualization attesting Mammut stronger scalability than CLIP (Fig. 1, 2), scalability can be also compared via computing derivatives of the obtained fit in selected compute points. Derivatives that have larger absolute values stand for larger slope (bigger rate of decrease) and thus indicate stronger scalability. In Tab. 5b we show derivatives computed for scaling law fits, obtaining larger derivatives for openMaMMUT than for openCLIP, confirming again stronger scalability for MaMMUT over CLIP."

            "title": "C Evaluating scaling law fit quality",
            "content": "To validate our scaling law fits, we use threshold Cthreshold to up which we take the data for the fit. We compute RMSE for the held-out points to get measure of how good each fit is. We compare two Cthreshold values (see Tab. 8 and Fig. 17 for DataComp-1.4B dataset). We see that both RMSE and uncertainty (the width of the confidence intervals) decreases as we take more the more points for the fit. We also compare different functional forms that can be used to fit the data: model with double saturation (L(C) = Ac (C + Bc)Î±c + Ec) and without term for irreducible error Ec: L(C) = Ac (C + Bc)Î±c (3) We choose first Cthreshold = 2.5 1011 GFLOPs and the second Cthreshold = 5 1011 GFLOPs. As we see from Tab. 8 and Tab. 9 for both values of Cthreshold double saturation form (Eq. 1) has consistently lower RMSE than the function without irreducible error. RMSE on held out points provides thus way to select among various scaling law fits the candidate that provides better prediction accuracy for unseen scales, which in our case is the fit obtained via double saturation functional form (Eq. 1). We see that the same trend of reducing confidence intervals and thus reducing uncertainty of the predictions when taking more points for the scaling law fit holds also for other tasks like MSCOCO image retrieval and other pre-training dataset Re-LAION-1.4B (see Fig. 17 and Fig. 18 for comparison between ImageNet-1k classification and MS-COCO retrieval and Figs. 19, 20 for Re-LAION-1.4B). When comparing predictions with actually measured downstream task performance, we see that accuracy for the held-out points is high (Tab. 8). For instance, we measure for 3B samples seen scale on held-out points for openMaMMUT ViT L-14 zero-shot IN1K 0.784, with prediction 0.777 and 95% confidence interval (0.771, 0.783), and for openMaMMUT ViT H-14 0.795, with prediction 0.801 Figure 15: Detailed version of the scaling law fit for ImageNet 0-shot classification error rate for DataComp-1.4B for openCLIP.

Similar accuracy is observed for openCLIP, with actual measurements falling within predicted confidence intervals. The derived scaling laws provide thus solid ground for comparison on unseen scales that have low amount of repetitions (less than 3x in case of 3B samples seen scale when training on DataComp-1.4B or Re-LAION-1.4). As already discussed in Sec. 3.7, the prediction for performance of MaMMUT L-14 on the larger 12.8B samples seen scale (Tab. 1, zero-shot IN1K 0.820, 95% CI (0.815, 0.826)) is therefore only made for low repetition scenario, and to validate it, dataset size larger than currently used 1.4B samples (which gives around 9x repetitions for 12.8B samples seen scale) is required. The measured 0.803 for openMaMMUT L-14 on 12.8B (Tab. 3) is thus expectedly below the prediction, as performance is diminished due to high amount of repetitions, in line with observations by previous works [41, 50].

Regardless of the patch size used during pre-training, we interpolate the patch size of all models to 14 14, to ensure fair comparison. We use an image input size of 224224 and thus interpolate the positional embedding to 1616. Hyperparameters used for training are consistent with [35], except the use of linear learning rate warmup of 1500 steps, an epochbased schedule of 31 epochs, and batch size of 16 without gradient accumulation, following [36]. We fine-tune pre-trained models up to and including ViT-L and 3B samples seen, with different pre-training hyperparameters. We evaluate using sliding window approach, again following [35]. Fig. 21 and Fig. 22 show the fitted scaling laws for CLIP and MaMMUT, respectively. Tab. 13 shows the corresponding estimated scaling law fit parameters."

While there are many potential societal consequences of this work, as of any work that targets scientific progress, we would like to emphasize some we consider important. Foundation models and datasets necessary for their creation became essential artefacts in basic machine learning research. On the one hand, they enable systematic studies of transferable learning and generalization. To ensure the reproducibility of such studies by various independent parties, to draw verifiable comparisons between those and to make collaborative, independently validated progress, models and datasets have to be open, and robust comparison procedures have to be designed. On the other hand, foundation models became"

Claims behind the capabilities of those systems to be rooted in certain conditions of the learning procedure and datasets used to obtain the models are made, often without doing proper comparison of compute involved in training of different models or without controlling for various conditions in the learning procedure. Especially the datasets used in the large industry labs are still often closed, so that it is impossible to do fair model comparison on same data if studying an alternative method. This makes claims"

Our work operates with whole research pipeline being fully open and reproducible, which includes open datasets, open-source training and evaluation code and open weights models, including intermediate checkpoints and training logs. Our comparison is done involving full scaling law derivation, instead of reporting performance on few selected reference points. This sets standards for reproducibility, transparency and robust comparison to check the claims in the field that generates important artefacts that are getting used in increasingly many scenarios that directly impact our society. We consider this work thus an important catalyst for trust into open foundation models that have undergone robust comparison procedure, resulting in accurate, reproducible claims that can be validated by many independent parties and in which the society and public can develop better trust. 28 Figure 22: Detailed scaling law for downstream semantic segmentation performance of openMaMMUT pre-trained on DataComp-1.4B and fine-tuned on ADE20K.
