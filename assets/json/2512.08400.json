            "content": "The sustainable management of global fisheries hinges on the availability of accurate, comprehensive, and timely data [1, 2]. Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems, which utilize cameras on fishing vessels, have emerged as powerful and cost-effective tool for fisheries data collection, offering an alternative to traditional methods relying on on-board observers and logbooks [3]. EM systems in fisheries are used for various objectives, including documenting catches [4, 5], ensuring legal compliance with fishing regulations, including catch limits [6], and reducing discards and bycatch [59]. However, the increased uptake of EM systems on-board fishing vessels has Corresponding Author. Figure 1. Sample images showing the diversity in image/video data encountered from EM systems.

In contrast, (e) represents clear view of catch with overlapping individuals, and (f) shows the ideal scenario in which the individuals are dispersed in an even layer across the conveyor belt without overlapping (Data Source: [15]). created new bottleneck where the volume of video data has exceeded the capacity to perform full-scale manual reviews [10, 11], problem compounded by poor image quality, occlusions, and varied video recording conditions [8, 1214]  (Fig. 1)  . Deep learning-based EM systems have emerged as promising technology for automating catch documentation in different types of fisheries, including demersal trawling [16, 17], demersal beam trawling [18], tropical purse seines [19], and longlines [2022]. Although these studies have shown commendable results in documenting catches in low occlusion environments, critical challenge remains as occlusion levels increase: maintaining the identity of individual fish for accurate counting and documentation. For example, on dynamic conveyor belt, fish are frequently occluded or move out of view, making it difficult to determine if fish is being seen for Proceedings of the 7th Northern Lights Deep Learning Conference (NLDL), PMLR 307, 2026. 2026 Samitha Nuwan Thilakarathna, Ercan Avsar, Martin Mathias Nielsen, & Malte Pedersen.

This frequent loss of visual contact leads to fundamental problem of identity loss, which can cause significant errors in fisheries data. To solve this, robust approach is needed to match an individuals identity each time it appears, task known as re-identification (Re-ID)  (Fig. 2)  . Re-ID has been extensively applied to persons [23] and vehicles [24]. However, the application of Re-ID in the aquatic domain remains sparse. Targeted Re-ID research in the field of aquatic sciences has primarily focused on species with distinct visual patterns [2530]. This paper evaluates deep learning architectures for fish Re-ID in simulated conveyor belt environment using the AutoFish dataset [31]. To rigorously isolate the feature extraction performance from upstream detection errors, this study utilizes groundtruth (GT) annotations, establishing theoretical performance ceiling for the Re-ID component. Our primary contributions are: (1). comparative analysis evaluating the hierarchical Vision Transformer Swin-T (Tiny) against the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ResNet-50, establishing the architectural advantage of self-attention mechanisms for finegrained fish Re-ID. (2). The identification of methodological strategies, including custom image transforms and hard triplet mining, that significantly improve Re-ID performance. (3). An in-depth analysis of the trained Swin transformers failure modes, revealing the core challenges in Fish Re-ID in partially occluded scenarios.

The dataset is composed of 1500 RGB images of 454 unique fish specimens from six most common fish species in the North Sea (Horse mackerel, whiting, haddock, cod, hake, saithe), and miscellaneous category. Crucially for Re-ID evaluation, the dataset is pre-split into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring that there are no overlapping fish IDs between the splits and shows similar species composition in each split. key feature of the dataset is its structured organization designed to simulate various real-world challenges. The data is partitioned into subcategories based on two factors: Fish arrangement and body viewpoint. Arrangement is categorized as either Separated, where fish do not overlap, or Touched, where fish are arranged to simulate partial occlusion. Viewpoint is categorized as either Initial, representing one side of the fish, or Flipped, representing the opposite side. This structure results in four distinct experimental conditions: Separated-Initial, SeparatedFlipped, Touched-Initial, Touched-Flipped. Each fish specimen in the dataset is represented by comprehensive set of 40 image instances, with 10 instances distributed into each of these four conditions. For our experiments, the input data was prepared by using the GT instance segmentation masks to crop each fish, with two pixel padding to preserve boundary details."

The ResNet-50 architecture, quintessential CNN, relies on deep stack of convolutional layers and residual connections to learn hierarchical local features. Its inductive bias is well-suited for capturing spatial hierarchies like textures and patterns. In contrast, the Swin-T architecture is hierarchical Vision Transformer that models long-range dependencies using shifted window self-attention mechanism. This allows it to capture global context and subtle, nonlocal relationships across an image. To establish baseline, we first evaluated the off-the-shelf models in zero-shot retrieval task, utilizing their original output dimensions (2048-D for ResNet-50, 768-D for Swin-T). Subsequently, for the fine-tuning experiments, we adapted both models by replacing their final classification layers with unified, learnable 512-dimensional embedding head  (Fig. 3)  . Figure 3.

However, the transferability of these emerging architectures to the visually homogeneous aquatic domain remains underexplored. Previous aquatic research has typically focused on single-species identification using various methodologies. Arzoumanian et al. [25], and Speed et al. [26] rely on the extraction of high-contrast keypoints (e.g., spots) to generate geometric point patterns in whale sharks. Haurum et al [27] advanced the field by applying deep metric learning to zebrafish. While Moskvyak et al. [28] employ landmark-guided approach that explicitly inputs annotated anatomical features (e.g., eyes, gills) to guide the learning of discriminative embeddings for manta rays, Pedersen et al. [29] utilize keypoint matching approach for sunfish. The latter relies on detecting and matching low-level visual interest points (using descriptors like SIFT or SuperPoint) to establish geometric correspondence via homography, without requiring semantic knowledge of specific body parts. In contrast, our work addresses the more complex challenge of re-identifying individuals across multiple, visually similar commercial fish simultaneously. In EM scenarios, relying on localized markers is precarious; if distinguishing feature is occluded on conveyor belt, identification fails at both the species and individual levels. To address this, we evaluate the Swin-T [32] against ResNet-50 [33] 3 An integral part of our methodology is custom resize-and-pad-to-square transformation, applied to fish crops before network input. This operation first resizes each image to preserve its original aspect ratio, then pads it to fit 224 224 canvas, ensuring that the entire fish and all local markings remain visible. In contrast, commonly used standard PyTorch training pipelines for ImageNet-style classification typically include random-sized crops or center crops after resizing, which can remove parts of the objects or heavily rescale small region [34, 35]. Such cropping is acceptable for coarse object classification. But it is prone to discarding subtle identity cues (e.g., local patterning and fin-edge structure) that are critical for fine-grained Re-ID. Finally, we computed and applied dataset-specific normalization statistics (Channel-wise mean - [0.0495, 0.0503, 0.0535]; Standard deviation = [0.1370, 0.1363, 0.1412]) to scale the preprocessed images properly."

Training ran for 300 epochs with AdamW optimizer (learning rate = 105, weight decay = 104), and learning rate scheduler was employed to reduce the learning rate by factor of 0.2 if the validation loss did not improve for 10 consecutive epochs."

For this, we partitioned the test set into its four subcategories as mentioned in section 2.1, and constructed distinct query and gallery sets to test the models performance in several key scenarios systematically: (1). Identical Conditions: We first established the models baseline capabilities by performing Re-ID within identical conditions (e.g., querying Separated-Initial against Separated-Initial gallery). This measures the models performance when viewpoint and occlusion levels are consistent. (2). Viewpoint Invariance: We tested the models robustness to changes in viewpoint by querying fish from one side against gallery of images showing the opposite side (e.g. SeparatedInitial vs Separated-Flipped). This directly evaluates the models ability to recognize an individual fish regardless of which side is presented to the camera. (3). Occlusion Robustness: We assessed the models resilience to occlusion by querying clearly visible fish against gallery where the fish are touching and particularly obscured (e.g., Separated-Initial vs. Touched-Initial). (4). Compound Challenges: Finally, we evaluated the model under the most difficult conditions by combining both viewpoint and occlusion changes (e.g., Separated-Initial vs. Touched-Flipped).

The similarity between query and each gallery image was quantified by calculating the Euclidean distance between their L2-normalized 512dimensional embeddings, where smaller distance indicates higher visual similarity. For each query, all gallery images were then ranked in ascending order based on this distance. The performance of this ranking was quantified using two standard metrics. R1 Accuracy measures the percentage of queries where the top-ranked result is correct identification and is defined as: R1 = 1 (cid:88) qQ I(id(q) = id(gq,1)) (1) Where is the total number of queries, and is an indicator function that is 1 if the ID of the query (q) matches the ID of its top-ranked gallery image (gq,1). mean Avergae Precision (mAP) at rank (mAP@k) provides more comprehensive score by evaluating the entire ranked list for each query. It is calculated by averaging the Average Precision (AP) scores across all queries in the test set Q. The AP for single query is defined as: AP(q) = 1 (cid:88) i= Prec(i) Relevance(i) (2) Where is single query image being evaluated, is the total number of images in the ranked gallery list. is the total number of relevant images for the query that exists in the gallery (i.e., the number of other images with the same fish ID). (cid:80)n i=1 is the summation over every position (rank) in the gallery, from the first position (i=1) to the last (i=n). rec(i) is the precision at rank i, which the proportion of correct matches found within the top results of the ranked list. Relevance(i) is an indicator function that is 1 if the image at rank is correct match (relevant to the query) and 0 if it is not. The precision can be calculated as follows. Precision = TP TP + FP (3) Where TP represents the number of true positives and FP represents the number of false positives. The final mAP is the mean of these AP scores: mAP (Q) = (cid:80)Q q=1 APq (4) In our specific protocol, since each query has exactly 39 corresponding true matches in the gallery, we report the mAP calculated over the top 39 ranks (mAP@k = mAP@39).

The ResNet-50 exhibits substantial overlap, consistent with its lower performance.

Grey density curves represent the distribution of Euclidean distances between positive pairs (same fish ID), and purple curves represent negative pairs (Different fish IDs). As we introduce challenges, clear divergence emerges: the model demonstrates remarkable performance to partial occlusion in the Touched-Initial gallery scenario (blue zone), maintaining R1 accuracy of 95.42% and mAP@k of 78.48%. This high performance is attributed to the preservation of the lateral viewpoint, allowing the model to exploit high-frequency texture details despite occlusion. In sharp contrast, the Separated-Flipped scenario (red zone)which presents the full, non-occluded fish but from the opposite sidecauses significant drop to 78.59% R1 accuracy and 69.24% mAP@k. This confirms that the loss of asymmetric lateral features is far more detrimental to identification than partial occlusion.

These are the gallery embedding vectors of the test dataset. Only 8 fish IDs out of 94 fish IDs in the test set are visualized in here for clear view. grained task. The consistent superiority of Swin-T over ResNet-50 is attributed to two key architectural differences. First, the transformers shifted window self-attention mechanism allows the model to propagate information across the entire image, capturing global context and subtle, distributed biological markers that local CNN receptive fields may miss. Second, our experiments revealed that Swin-T maintains high performance even at smaller batch sizes, whereas ResNet-50 performance degrades. We attribute this to the difference in normalization strategies: ResNet relies on batch normalization (BN), where the calculation of mean and variance becomes unstable with small batches [36]. In contrast, SwinT employs layer normalization (LN), which computes statistics independently for each sample [37]. This makes the transformer architecture significantly more robust for tasks where hardware constraints limit batch size. Methodologically, the resize and pad to square image transformation proved essential for preserving extremity features, and fixed hard triplet margin (m = 0.5) successfully enforced rigorous identity separation in this controlled setting. However, we acknowledge that this hyperparameter involves trade-off. While effective for clean laboratory data, high fixed margin may hinder convergence in realworld fishing environments characterized by high visual noise (e.g., blood, debris). Future work should prioritize an ablation study to optimize margins for noisy domains or explore adaptive margin strategies. Crucially, our analysis reveals that viewpoint consistency is stronger determinant of Re-ID success than feature completeness for this specific study. This confirms that the lateral viewpoint contains the primary identity signature; preserving it allows for robust matching even under occlusion, whereas flipping the fish removes access to critical or subtle asymmetric features. Furthermore, we observe that consistency in occlusion state is secondary to query integrity. Retrieval performance decreases when using an occluded query (Touched) even against similarly occluded gallery. In contrast, featurerich, non-occluded query (Separated) successfully retrieves targets even in occluded scenarios. This suggests that complete visual signature is more valuable to the model than matching the occlusion levels between the query and the gallery. The error analysis reveals that mistakes were almost exclusively intra-species. This indicates that future data collection efforts should prioritize acquiring Hard-Negative examplesvisually similar individuals of the same species under varied viewpointsto further refine the models capability for fine-grained discrimination. These insights are highly valuable for developing robust automated catch recognition systems. By prioritizing high-quality query acquisition or best shot selection systems can prevent identity loss even in cluttered environments. This capability ensures reliable re-identification, directly improving the quality of catch data required for downstream tasks such as stock assessments, selectivity studies, and gear development."
