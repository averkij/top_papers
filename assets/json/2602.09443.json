Introduction Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) (Comanici et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025) have propelled artificial intelligence beyond symbolic manipulation toward science-grade reasoning (Bai et al., 2025a; Gibney, 2025; Zhang et al., 2024). Among scientific disciplines, physics stands as the critical test anchor for these emerging capabilities. Physics inherently demands rigorous synthesis of multimodal perception and causal logic to model the behavior of the universe. Consequently, the ability to solve complex physics problems, task that often requires mapping physical intuition to abstract laws, provides rigorous test for genuine, first-principles reasoning. Olympiad-level competitions, such as the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) serve as significant surrogate to evaluate the physics reasoning capacity of language models, where problems demand deep conceptual understanding and precise system decomposition. While recent works have begun to adapt LLMs for these challenges (Chen et al., 2025b; Qiu et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025b), they predominantly focus on textual reasoning, overlooking fundamental characteristic of physical problem-solving: its inherent multimodality. In many Olympiad problems, diagrams are not merely illustrative but constitutivethey contain essential geometric constraints, circuit topologies, and force interactions that are purposefully omitted from the text. Without the ability to perceive and interpret these visual schematics, text-only model faces an insurmountable information gap. As illustrated in Figure 2 (IPhO 2025), the task involves quantifying bubble radii and ascent velocities directly from visual inputs, effectively simulating the data analysis process in real-world physics experiments. Thus, Physics Olympiads serve as high-fidelity testbeds for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), verifying the critical ability to align visual observations with abstract physical laws (Yu et al., 2025a). Figure 2 question sample from the International Physics Olympiad 2025 (IPhO 2025), where the question requires measuring the radius of bubbles and estimating their velocity in Fig 2. Successfully bridging this visual-logical gap is more than an academic achievement; it lays the foundation for general-purpose physical intelligence. We posit that mastering the rigorous constraints of Olympiad problems is necessary precursor to achieving machine scientific discovery (Zheng et al., 2025c) and reliable embodied AI. Just as scientist needs theory and robot needs world model, 3 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads future AI systems must first internalize the laws of physics in controlled environment. Therefore, our focus on Olympiad-level reasoning is not an end in itself, but strategic step toward building systems capable of understanding and eventually navigating the physical reality. In this work, we introduce P1-VL, new family of open-source vision-language models designed to advance the frontier of scientific AI. Our framework harmonizes two critical paradigms: Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (RL) Training and Agentic Augmentation. This dual approach ensures that the model not only internalizes robust reasoning capabilities through RL (Sutton et al., 1998), but also effectively operationalizes them via adaptive agentic control during inference (Feng et al., 2026). Curriculum RL Training. P1-VL is developed exclusively through RL post-training (Cui et al., 2025a; Guo et al., 2025) built upon base vision-language models. To maximize the efficacy of this paradigm, we introduce curriculum RL framework that systematically advances reasoning capabilities through progressive difficulty expansion, and robust stabilization mechanisms. By ensuring structured learning trajectory, our design enables sustained, long-term optimization and effectively circumvents notorious RL pitfalls such as reward sparsity, entropy collapse, and training stagnation. Agentic Augmentation. During the inference phase, we integrate P1-VL models with the PhysicsMinions agent framework (Yu et al., 2025b) to enable iterative correction and self-verification. This mechanism facilitates multi-turn reflection, empowering the model to reason, critique, and refine its solutionsmirroring the rigorous cognitive process of human physicists. By leveraging this structured test-time reasoning, P1-VL effectively extends its problem-solving depth and reliability without requiring additional training parameters. We release two variants of the P1-VL family and evaluate them on HiPhO (Yu et al., 2025a), rigorous benchmark aggregating 13 recent Olympiad exams from 20242025. Our flagship model, P1-VL-235B-A22B, marks significant milestone for the open-source community: it is the first specialized physics vision-language model to secure 12 golds and 1 silver across the full HiPhO suite. Remarkably, the standalone P1-VL surpasses even the agent-enhanced text baseline (P1-235B-A22B+PhysicsMinions (Chen et al., 2025b)), ranking 3rd among all open and closedsource models. Meanwhile, our lightweight variant, P1-VL-30B-A3B, achieves 9 gold medals, surpassing the average score of most open-source models. When further augmented with the PhysicsMinions agent framework, P1-VL ascends to the 2nd overall spot on the leaderboard. Beyond its specialized domain, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable generalizability. In the multidisciplinary FrontierScience-Olympiad, both P1-VL-235B-A22B and P1-VL-30B-A3B models demonstrate robust gains across biology, chemistry, and physics, outperforming their respective baselines by margins of 8.0 and 9.1 points, respectively. In the mathematical reasoning tasks and multi-modal STEM reasoning tasks, our model could also consistently outperform their base models. This superiority extends to out-of-domain evaluations, where both variants consistently eclipse their base models across diverse text, and multi-modal benchmarks. Contributions. This work makes the following key contributions: We introduce P1-VL, first family of open-source Vision-Language Model specialized in physics problems, achieving 12 gold medals in physics Olympiad competitions. We develop curriculum RL framework with difficulty expansion, and training stabilization for sustained reasoning improvement. We open-source the P1-VL model family, filling the multimodal void within the P1 ecosystem (Chen et al., 2025b), and bridging the gap between visual perception and scientific reasoning. Collectively, the progress lays the foundation for AI systems that not only interpret reality but eventually contribute to the frontiers of physics research and the development of robust world models. 4 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Statistics Data Composition Total Problems - Problems from Olympiads - Problems from textbooks Total Answers Total Fields Total Subfields Total Answer Types Data Sources Textbooks Olympiad Types - Sets Collected Token Statistics Average Question Tokens Max Question Tokens Max Solution Tokens Images Statistics Questions with Images Questions without Images Max Images per Question Average Images per Question Number 8,033 4,126 (51%) 3,907 (49%) 10,516 5 25 5 20 9 199 943 6,604 5,519 5,513 2,520 8 0. Table 1 Statistics of the multi-modal training data. Figure 3 Distribution of the training data. 2. Physics Dataset 2.1. Overview We introduce systematically curated multimodal dataset of 8,033 problems designed to advance genuine scientific reasoning in VLMs. The dataset includes problems from physics Olympiads (4,126), undergraduate textbooks (2,968), and competition guides (939), as summarized in Table 1. 2.2. Dataset Construction Data Collection. Our data construction is driven by core objective: enabling VLMs to internalize structured reasoning aligned with physical laws and empirical consistencya prerequisite for genuine scientific intelligence. To achieve this, we prioritize problems that combine conceptual depth with ruleverifiable outcomes, traits shown to catalyze reasoning improvements (Chen et al., 2025b; Guo et al., 2025; Wen et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). Within the physics domain, physics Olympiad problems naturally contain such properties: they demand rigorous modeling and multi-step inference while remaining formally tractable. The value of this specific difficulty profile is underscored by empirical findings in PHYSICS (Zheng et al., 2025b), which demonstrate that LLMs face greater challenges in Olympiad tasks than in introductory undergraduate problems. Accordingly, we first curate our dataset from two complementary pillars: ten prestigious physics Olympiads (up to 2023, including IPhO and APhO) that capture graded difficulty spectrum, and ten authoritative competition textbooks that provide systematically organized exercises with expert-verified solutions. To further augment the datasets multi-modal richness, we extend our collection to include undergraduate textbooks. These sources serve as vital repository of image-centric problems, significantly enhancing the overall density of visual schematics and diagrams within the corpus. 5 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Figure 4 Data collection pipeline for physics data. Data Annotation. Driven both by the demand for high-quality extraction and the heterogeneity of the sources, the construction process is organized as multi-stage pipeline (Figure 11) following the pipeline of P1(Chen et al., 2025b). 2.3. Quality Control. To ensure data reliability, we implement rigorous multi-stage pipeline integrating automated model-based filtering with human verification. (1) OCR Correction. Texts parsed from complex layouts or low-quality scans are manually validated against original PDFs to rectify OCR artifacts. (2) Answer Cross-Validation. Three models Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o independently extract answers from each questionsolution pair. Consensus is established via majority vote (at least two models agree); non-consensus items are discarded. (3) Task Filtering. Problems requiring diagram generation or involving unverifiable open-ended answers (e.g., proofs) are removed. (4) Visual Consistency Check. We utilize Gemini-2.5-Flash to detect and filter out samples where the question text references figure that is missing from the input. (5) Expert Review. final consistency check is performed by Claude-3.7-Sonnet, followed by targeted manual refinement by experts. Through this filtering process, the dataset is refined from 13,432 to 8,033 items, yielding high-fidelity, multi-modal bilingual corpus well-suited for RLVR. 3. Approach 3.1. RL Formulation We formulate the challenge of solving Physics Olympiad problems through the lens of reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton et al., 1998) process. Formally, let = (S, A, 𝑃, 𝑟) denote the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), where: 6 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads represents the state space, corresponding to the model context, including the problem statement and all previously generated reasoning tokens. is the action space, which constitutes the discrete action space of possible tokens in the vocabulary. 𝑃(𝑠 𝑠, 𝑎) defines (deterministic) state transition function, which appends the newly chosen action 𝑎 to the state 𝑠, resulting in an updated context 𝑠. 𝑟(𝑠, 𝑎) provides scalar reward indicating the correctness and quality of the finalized reasoning trajectory. The learning objective is to optimize the policy 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the expected return: 𝐽 (𝜋𝜃) = 𝔼𝜏𝜋𝜃 (cid:35) 𝑟(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) , (cid:34) 𝑇 𝑡=0 (1) where 𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) is the policy parameterized by model parameters 𝜃, and 𝜏 = (𝑠0, 𝑎0, . . . , 𝑠𝑇 ) denotes trajectory sampled from 𝜋𝜃. Policy Gradient. The policy gradient (Sutton et al., 1999) method optimizes 𝜋𝜃 by ascending the gradient of the expected return: 𝜃 𝐽 (𝜋𝜃) = 𝔼𝜏𝜋𝜃 𝜃 log 𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) 𝐴𝜋(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) , (cid:35) (cid:34) 𝑇 𝑡= (2) where 𝐴𝜋(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) is the advantage function estimating the relative value of action 𝑎𝑡 in state 𝑠𝑡. We adopt this standard form and instantiate it via GSPO below. Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025a) elevates optimization from the token level (Shao et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025c) to the sequence level, employing lengthnormalized sequence likelihood importance ratios: 𝜌𝑖 (𝜃) = (cid:19) 1/ 𝑦𝑖 (cid:18) 𝜋𝜃( 𝑦𝑖𝑥) 𝜋𝜃old ( 𝑦𝑖𝑥) = exp (cid:32) 1 𝑦𝑖 𝑦𝑖 𝑡=1 log 𝜋𝜃( 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 𝑥, 𝑦𝑖,<𝑡) 𝜋𝜃old ( 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 𝑥, 𝑦𝑖,<𝑡) (cid:33) , (3) where 𝑦𝑖 denotes the sequence length, and the 1/ 𝑦𝑖 term implements length normalization to reduce variance. The corresponding advantage function is computed at the sequence level: ˆ𝐴GSPO 𝑖 = 𝑅𝑖 mean({𝑅 𝑗}𝐺 𝑖=1 std({𝑅 𝑗}𝐺 ) 𝑖=1 ) , with the objective function: 𝐽GSPO(𝜃) = 𝔼𝑥D,{ 𝑦𝑖 }𝐺 𝑖=1 𝜋𝜃 old ( 𝑥 ) (cid:34) 1 𝐺 𝐺 𝑖=1 (cid:16) min 3.2. Instantiation 𝜌𝑖 (𝜃) ˆ𝐴GSPO 𝑖 , clip(𝑠𝑖 (𝜃), 1 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖) ˆ𝐴GSPO 𝑖 (4) (cid:35) (cid:17) . (5) We keep the same design of the reward and the verifier following P1 Series (Chen et al., 2025b). Reward Design. We employ binary reward scheme based on answer correctness, leveraging the fact that our physics dataset contains verifiable ground-truth outcomes: (cid:40) 𝑟 = if the predicted answer matches the ground truth, 1, 0, otherwise. (6) 7 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads The we adopt the test-case-style reward aggregation, defining the final reward as: 𝑅 = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝑟𝑖, (7) where 𝑁 is the number of required sub-answers in the problem, and 𝑟𝑖 denotes the correctness indicator for the 𝑖-th sub-answer. Furthermore, we apply the system prompt as shown in Figure 5 to extract the multi-box answers. System Prompt of Multi-box Style Please answer the problem adhering to the following rules: 1. Please use LaTeX format to represent the variables and formulas used in the solution process and results. 2. Please put the final answer(s) in boxed{}, note that the unit of the answer should not be included in boxed{}. 3. If the problem requires multiple answers, list them in order, each in separate boxed{}. Figure 5 System prompt design for P1-VL training. Verifier Design. Physics problems frequently necessitate solutions in the form of complex symbolic expressions rather than scalar values, posing challenge for standard verification metrics. We implement the hybrid verification framework that harmonizes rigorous symbolic logic with semantic model evaluation: (1) Rule-Based Verifier, we integrate symbolic computation libraries (SymPy (Meurer et al., 2017)) with heuristic strategies from math-verify (Kydlíček); (2) To capture correct answers that elude strict symbolic matching, we adopt the XVerify (Chen et al., 2025a) paradigm. We employ specialized LLM (Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct) as semantic judge. 3.3. Technical Design 3.3.1. Curriculum Training Preliminary Difficulty Calculation and Filtering Strategy. The distribution of data difficulty and data quality plays pivotal role in the convergence of RL training (Cui et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025). To construct an effective training set, we adopt an inference-based metric to estimate the solvability of each instance. Let 𝐷(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖) denote the empirical pass rate: 𝐷(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖) = 1 𝑁 𝑁 𝑘= 𝕀( ˆ𝑦𝑘 = 𝑦𝑖), (8) where ˆ𝑦𝑘 denotes the 𝑘-th response generated by the model. We utilize the Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B model to perform extensive rollouts (with 𝑁 = 72) on the training dataset. The correctness of inference rollouts is determined only by the rule-based verifier. Based on the distribution of 𝐷(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖), we apply dual-end filtering strategy: 1. Pruning Trivial Samples (𝐷(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖) > 0.7): Samples that the model can already solve with high confidence contribute minimal gradient variance during optimization, accelerating entropy collapse of the policy model (Cui et al., 2025b). To improve training efficiency, we categorize samples with 𝐷 > 0.7 as \"trivial\" and remove them from the training set following Chen et al. (2025b). 8 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads 2. Recovering Zero-Shot Failures (𝐷(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖) = 0.0): Samples where the pass rate is strictly 0.0 present challenge; they represent either hard-core reasoning steps or malformed questions. Training on the malformed questions can lead to reward hacking or instability. Thus, we filter these malformed samples and introduce recovery pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash. We prompt such stronger model to (a) verify the alignment between the question and image, and (b) verify the completeness of the question, including physical factors or numerical values, (c) refine ambiguous problem descriptions. The unrecoverable tasks are finally excluded to maintain the overall quality. This process converts previously \"unsolvable\" noise into effective, clear RL tasks. Curriculum RL Training. Directly training with RL on difficult problems for the VLMs could cause unstable policy gradients and low efficiency because of the low success rates, thus, we expand the difficulty of the tasks step by step. In the initial stage, we train the model with samples that exhibit pass rate below an upper threshold of 0.7. By filtering out trivial instances (i.e., those with success rates 𝐷(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖) > 0.7) early in the process, we prevent the model from wasting computation on tasks it has already mastered. Subsequently, we further intensify the training challenge by lowering this inclusion threshold. This progressive tightening of the difficulty constraint effectively prunes moderately easy samples from the dataset, compelling the model to concentrate its optimization capacity exclusively on the harder tail of the distribution, where its performance is still lacking. As the curriculum shifts toward the harder tail of the distribution, static rollout configurations become restrictive, failing to provide the search depth required for these escalated challenges (Cui et al., 2025b; Luo et al., 2025a). Thus, we follow P1(Chen et al., 2025b) to dynamically expand the exploration space, such as group size and generation window, in pace with the difficulty expansion, ensuring the search budget scales adequately to sustain long-term learnability. 3.3.2. Training Stabilization Mechanism Mitigate Train-inference Mismatch Recent studies (Liu et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2025) have noticed that the train-inference engine difference is key cause of instability in RL training. An empirical analysis is shown in Section 5.2. To formally understand this statement, Eq. 2 could be rewritten as, 𝜃 𝐽 (𝜋𝜃) = 𝔼𝜏𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝜃 𝜃 log 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝜃 (𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) 𝐴𝜋(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) , (cid:35) (cid:34) 𝑇 𝑡=0 (9) 𝜃 where 𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 denotes the policy used to generate trajectories during rollout, and 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 denotes the policy evaluated during gradient computation. RL frameworks (Sheng et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025b) often adopt different engines for rollout (e.g. vllm (Kwon et al., 2023) and SGLang (Zheng et al., 2024)) and training (e.g. FSDP (Merry et al., 2021) and Megatron (Shoeybi et al., 2019)), which introduce mismatch between 𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 due to differences in numerical precision, computation optimization strategies, and kernel implementations, leading to biased gradient estimates and training instability: 𝜋𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑎𝑠) 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and 𝜋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 (𝑎𝑠). 𝜃 𝜃 𝜃 𝜃 𝜃 Masked Importance Sampling. To mitigate the instability caused by the training-inference mismatch, we adopt Sequence-level Masked Importance Sampling (Seq-MIS) (Liu et al., 2025). Unlike tokenlevel clipping methods, Seq-MIS employs \"hard trust region\" by rejecting entire out-of-distribution trajectories. However, the cumulative importance weight 𝜌(𝜏) scales exponentially with sequence length 𝑇, making it difficult to set consistent rejection threshold 𝐶 for tasks with varying lengths. To address this, we adopt the Geometric Mean of the importance weights to normalize the metric across 9 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads different lengths. The gradient estimator is formulated as: 𝜃 𝐽Geo-MIS(𝜃) = 𝔼𝜏𝜋old (cid:16) 𝕀 (cid:124) (cid:17) 𝜌(𝜏) 𝜌(𝜏)1/𝑇 𝐶 (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32) (cid:123)(cid:122) Geo-Mask (cid:125) 𝑇 𝑡=0 𝜃 log 𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡) 𝐴𝜋(𝑠𝑡, 𝑎𝑡) , (10) where 𝜏 = (𝑠0, 𝑎0, . . . , 𝑠𝑇 , 𝑎𝑇 ) represents the sampled trajectory, and 𝑇 is the sequence length. The sequence-level importance weight is defined as 𝜌(𝜏) = (cid:206)𝑇 . 𝕀() denotes the indicator function, rejecting trajectories whose geometric mean of importance weights exceeds the threshold 𝐶. (𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡 ) (𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑡 ) 𝜋trainer 𝜋rollout 𝑡=0 𝜃 𝜃 3.4. Training Dynamics Implementation. For the implementation of P1-VL training pipeline, we adopt the VERL (Sheng et al., 2024) framework, which is an efficient VLMs post-training framework offering the RL implementation in Megatron. We adopt Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking as starting points of models. To adaptively adjust the aforementioned learnability during training, we periodically resume training from the previous checkpoint with updated configurations. Image Processing For questions containing images, the special token <image> is inserted at the corresponding position within the text. To facilitate unified RL training across modalities, we standardize the input format by padding all text-only samples with blank image of resolution 448 448, and appending the <image> token to the end of the question. Vision-language models (VLMs), such as Qwen3-VL (Bai et al., 2025b) and Intern3.5-VL (Wang et al., 2025), typically consist of an image encoder, language model, and projection layer that bridges the two. Since our training data is not specifically curated for image alignment, we freeze the parameters of both the vision encoder and the projection layer during RL training. The analysis of training data composition is shown in Section 5.3. Furthermore, we empirically observe that padding images has negligible impact on text-only performance. Therefore, we omit blank images during evaluation. Settings of Curriculum Training Phrases. We detail the stage-wise hyperparameter settings of the P1-VL post-training process in Table 2. Following our curriculum framework, we progressively amplify the training complexity by scaling the data difficulty (metric defined in Eq. 8) and expanding the exploration space via larger group sizes and extended generation windows. To bridge the train-inference gap, we consistently apply Masked Importance Samplinga correction technique for off-policy stabilityacross all stages. Notably, our optimization backbone is built upon the GSPO algorithm to ensure stable convergence for MoE architectures. Furthermore, we exclusively employ rule-based verifiers during training to mitigate reward hacking. Analysis. Figure 6 illustrates the training dynamics across the curriculum RL process. key observation is the gradual increase in response length, indicating that the model is developing the capacity for deeper reasoning to tackle complex problems. To accommodate this evolving capability, we strategically expand the difficulty and meanwhile expand exploration space by increasing the generation window and group size at each stage transition. Quantitatively, validation results on HiPhO demonstrate steady performance improvement throughout training, underscoring both the effectiveness and the stability of our algorithm. detailed analysis of the effect of expansion is shown in Section 5.4. 10 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Table 2 Configuration of different phrases in P1-VL training.

Agentic Augmentation At inference time, we enhance test-time reasoning with unified agentic augmentation framework, PhysicsMinions (Yu et al., 2025b), pioneering coevolutionary multi-agent system for multimodal scientific problem solving. The system is organized into three tightly coupled studios: the Visual Studio, the Logic Studio, and the Review Studio. The Visual Studio performs structured perception and converts raw visual evidence into symbolic representations. The Logic Studio generates and iteratively refines candidate solutions through solver and introspector collaboration. The Review Studio validates solutions using both domain-specific and general verification. Together, these studios form closed critique and refinement loop that enables scalable test-time reasoning and improves robustness on complex scientific tasks. key distinction from the earlier text-only P1 deployment of PhysicsMinions (Chen et al., 2025b) is that P1-VL fully activates the Visual Studio to process diagrams, plots, and other visual inputs. By grounding reasoning in structured visual representations, the system can directly incorporate visual evidence into downstream symbolic reasoning, enabling effective handling of multimodal Olympiad-style problems. Beyond multimodal perception, we extend the agent pipeline with domain-adaptive mechanism that generalizes the framework to heterogeneous scientific disciplines. The system automatically selects discipline-specific solver prompts and domain verifiers according to the detected problem type, such as physics, chemistry, or biology, while all remaining agent components and interaction protocols are shared. On the physics-only HiPhO benchmark (Yu et al., 2025a), the system employs the Physics-Verifier in setting consistent with prior physics-focused evaluations. On the multidisciplinary FrontierScience-Olympiad benchmark (Wang et al., 2026), the same pipeline dynamically routes problems to the appropriate domain verifier and solver configuration. These experiments demonstrate that combining visual grounding with domain-adaptive agentic reasoning supports effective performance across physics, chemistry, and biology Olympiad-level problems. 4. Experiment 4.1. Experimental Setup Test Dataset. To rigorously evaluate performance on advanced physical reasoning tasks, we introduce the HiPhO benchmark (Yu et al., 2025a), the first dataset dedicated exclusively to High School Physics Olympiads. HiPhO aggregates 13 major exams administered between 2024 and 2025, spanning seven prestigious international and regional competition series: IPhO, APhO, EuPhO, NBPhO, PanPhO, PanMechanics, and F=MA. The inclusion criteria prioritized both global influence and the availability 11 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Figure 6 The training dynamics of P1-VL curriculum RL. The upper side shows the dynamics of P1-VL-30B-A3B, and the lower shows those of P1-VL-235B-A22B. The training is set in three stages with curriculum difficulty expansion, group size expansion, and generation window expansion. The average response length represents the generation length during training, and the overall points refer to the sum score of all the exams in HiPhO with model-based verifier (Qwen-3-30B-Instruct-2507). of granular human performance data to facilitate direct human-AI comparison1. Comparison Models. We compared against 39 representative models, including 13 closed-source and 26 open-source models, selected to reflect the current frontier of LLMs and VLMs : Closed-source models: Gemini-3-Pro (Deepmind), GPT-5.2 (OpenAI, c), GPT-5 (OpenAI, b), o3 (OpenAI, d), o4-mini (high) (OpenAI, d), o4-mini (OpenAI, d), GPT-4o (OpenAI, a), Gemini-2.5Pro (Comanici et al., 2025), Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking (Comanici et al., 2025), Grok-4 (xAI), Claude-4-Sonnet-Thinking (Anthropic), Claude-4-Sonnet (Anthropic), Mistral-Medium-3 (Mistral). Open-source models: DeepSeek-V3.2-Thinking (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), Qwen3-VL Series (Bai et al., 2025b), Intern-S1 (Bai et al., 2025a), InternVL3 Series (Zhu et al., 2025a), Qwen2.5-VL Series (Bai et al., 2025c), GLM-4.5V (Team et al., 2025a), DeepSeek-VL2 (Wu et al., 2024), LLaMA4Scout-17B (Meta), Phi-4-multimodal (Abouelenin et al., 2025), P1 Series (Chen et al., 2025b), GPT-OSS-120B (Agarwal et al., 2025), Kimi-K2-Thinking (Team et al., 2025b), Kimi-K2-Instruct (Team et al., 2025b), DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al., 2024), Qwen3 Series (Yang et al., 2025). Model Configurations. All models were evaluated under standardized inference setup following the HiPhO protocol. The temperature was fixed at 0.6, and the maximum token limit was set as large as permitted by each model. For every problem, we conducted 8 independent inference runs and computed the average score per problem. These averages were then aggregated across problems to yield the final exam score for each Olympiad. 1Notable competitions such as CPhO, USAPhO, and APhO-2024 were excluded due to the unavailability of complete official contestant score distributions. 12 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Evaluation Method. Adhering to the HiPhO benchmark protocol (Yu et al., 2025a), we employ Gemini-2.5-Flash as the automated evaluator. The evaluation framework mirrors official Olympiad grading by integrating both answer-level verification and step-level reasoning analysis. For each problem, the final score is determined as the maximum of the answer-based and step-based evaluations. This mechanism ensures consistency with human adjudication: correct final answer gains full credit, while rigorous intermediate derivations earn partial points even if the final result is incorrect. Consequently, we report the cumulative exam score rather than standard accuracy, facilitating direct comparison between model performance and official human medal thresholds. 4.2. Evaluation on Physics Olympiads Superior Single-Model Performance. Evaluation results are presented in Table 3, verifying the effectiveness of our RL training strategy. As noted above, the P1-VL model series is trained purely through reinforcement learning. P1-VL-235B-A22B ranks 3rd among all evaluated models, following only Gemini-3-Pro and GPT5.2. With 12 gold and 1 silver medals (average score: 39.3), it surpasses the closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro (37.7), GPT-5 (37.4), and Grok-4 (35.8). Notably, the standalone P1-VL outperforms the agent-augmented baseline (P1-235B-A22B + PhysicsMinions, 38.4), proving that intrinsic visual reasoning capabilities can surpass purely agentic workflows in complex physical scenarios, which incorporates image caption information. It shows that our models could effectively perceive the image information and bridge it to the scientific reasoning (case study for Text+Variable Figure is shown in Appendix A.2). Compared with its base model (Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking, 33.9), it improves 5.4 points on average. P1-VL-30B-A3B achieves 9 gold and 4 silver medals with an average score of 35.0. It ranks third among open-source models, behind only DeepSeek-V3.2-Thinking and P1-235B-A22B. Despite its smaller size, it outperforms larger baselines such as Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking (33.9) and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 (33.5), demonstrating significant parameter efficiency. It also outperforms some closed-source models such as o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking, showing excellent performance on scientific reasoning. Agentic Augmentation. With the agentic augmentation of PhysicsMinions, the average score of P1-VL-235B-A22B improves from 39.3 to 40.9, propelling it to the 2nd rank globally and surpassing the closed-source GPT-5.2 (40.6). This combined system establishes new state-of-the-art performance on three physics Olympiads, including PanPhO 2025 (66.5 vs 66.3), PanPhO 2024 (83.3 vs 82.5), and PanMechanics 2024 (84.8 vs 82.3). These gains underscore the efficacy of the \"model + system\" paradigm, demonstrating how multi-agent collaboration significantly amplifies complex scientific reasoning capabilities. 13 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Table 3 Evaluation results on the HiPhO benchmark (13 physics Olympiads from 20242025) using the exam score metric.

Discussion 5.1. Generalizability of P1-VL We conduct specialized post-training to enhance physics problem-solving; however, critical question remains: Does this domain-specific optimization compromise or catalyze general STEM reasoning? To investigate the models generalization capabilities, we evaluate P1-VL on the open-source benchmark FrontierScience-Olympiad (Wang et al., 2026). As detailed in Table 4, the results demonstrate robust positive transfer: both P1-VL-235B-A22B and P1-VL-30B-A3B achieve significant gains over their base counterparts across all three scientific domains, yielding total score improvement of 8.0 and 9.1, respectively. Remarkably, even on this text-only benchmark, the multimodal P1-VL-235B-A22B outperforms its text-only sibling (P1-235B-A22B) by margin of 2.3 points. Furthermore, when augmented with the PhysicsMinions agent framework, P1-VL-235B-A22B+PhysicsMinions attains total score of 67.1, securing state-of-the-art performance among all evaluated open-source models.

P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Figure 7 Evaluation of P1-VL models against their respective base models on out-of-domain benchmarks. The evaluation suite encompasses both text-only and multi-modal tasks, spanning mathematical reasoning and broader STEM disciplines. Multi-modal Benchmarks: five STEM-oriented benchmarks, including HLE (Phan et al., 2025)), MMMU (Yue et al., 2024a), MMMU-Pro (Yue et al., 2024b), EMMA-Mini (Hao et al., 2025), and MathVista-Mini (Lu et al., 2024)2. Figure 7 summarizes the comparative results, illustrating that our models consistently surpass their base counterparts across both text-only and multi-modal benchmarks. For example, in the domain of advanced mathematics, P1-VL-235B-A22B and P1-VL-30B-A3B outperform their respective baselines on AMOBench by margins of 8.5 and 7.5 points. This pattern confirms that P1-VLs not only retain but actively enhance reasoning capabilities beyond the target physics domain, extending even to rigorous challenges such as IMO-AnswerBench and AMOBench. The advantage is not limited to text-based reasoning but extends significantly to visual perception. Taking the multi-image reasoning task EMMA-Mini as prime example, P1-VL-235B-A22B and P1-VL-30B-A3B achieve substantial gain of 1.7 and 3.4 points over their baseline. This result specifically highlights the models enhanced capacity to synthesize information across multiple images and little catastrophic forgetting issue (Luo et al., 2025b) during RL training, validating the effectiveness of our vision-language alignment beyond standard physics problems. 2For MathVista-Mini and MMMU, we adopt the evaluation scripts posted on the Qwen3-VL repository, and for MMMU-Pro we adopt the setting in MMMU repository. 16 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads 5.2. Train-inference Mismatch During the RL post-training of Qwen3-VL-MoE models on our physics data, we observe catastrophic training collapse as illustrated in Figure 8. This instability aligns with the traininginference mismatch phenomenon characterized in recent analyses (Liu et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2025), where discrepancies between the inference engine and training framework lead to divergent policy updates. While implementing Truncated Importance Sampling (TIS) (Yao et al., 2025) postpones the onset of this collapse, it still encounters an instability in our experiments. In contrast, adopting Sequence-Level Masked Importance Sampling (Seq-MIS) (Liu et al., 2025) could stabilize the training process. By strictly rejecting out-of-distribution samples rather than merely clipping their weights, SeqMIS could maintain more rigorous policy alignment; thus, we adopt Seq-MIS throughout our P1-VL RL post-training. 5.3. Effect of Training Data Composition We also empirically analyze the impact of training data composition. Figure 9 illustrates the performance of Qwen3-VL-4B-Thinking (using XVerifier) when trained exclusively on questions containing images. Crucially, we observe that incorporating text-only data (padded with blank images) induces no negative transfer; rather, it yields superior performance almost all the time. It demonstrates the feasibility and superiority of using mixed multi-modal data. Consequently, we train our P1-VL models using combination of both the text-only and image-text data. 5.4. Effect of Curriculum Training Figure 8 Driven by training-inference mismatch, the RL training of Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking MoE model suffers from severe collapse. The implementation of Masked Importance Sampling (MIS) proves effective in stabilizing the training. Figure 9 Comparison of Qwen3-VL-4B-Thinking training performance on the image-text data versus the mixed data (text-only + image-text). Figure 10 illustrates the impact of curriculum training on model evolution. Each line includes period of observation after the parameters are fixed. It shows that in the absence of difficulty expansion, the response length fluctuates stagnantly across Stages 1 and 2, resulting in negligible performance gains. Conversely, introducing the curriculum strategy yields marked increase in both average response length and reasoning accuracy. These results underscore the critical role of our curriculum RL framework in driving deep reasoning. 17 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Figure 10 Training dynamics of RL training with and without curriculum difficulty expansion. 6. Conclusion In this work, we presented P1-VL, the first open-source Vision-Language Model family capable of achieving Olympiad-level proficiency in physics. By addressing the critical visual-logical gap inherent in physical problem solving, P1-VL overcomes the limitations of text-only reasoning. We proposed to improve the reasoning capacity by Curriculum RL Training to internalize robust reasoning patterns and Agentic Augmentation to enable rigorous test-time reflection. The evaluation results on the HiPhO benchmark, where P1-VL-235B-A22B secured 12 gold medals and demonstrated superior generalization across broader scientific disciplines, underscore the potential of P1-VLs in modeling complex scientific reasoning systems. We posit that the ability to synthesize visual constraints with causal logic is essential for the development of reliable world models and embodied AI. By releasing P1-VL to the research community, we aim to accelerate the transition from symbolic manipulation to genuine machine scientific discovery, paving the way for AI systems that can truly understand and navigate the physical world. 7.

RL Training on Intern Series We further verify the effectiveness of our RL training on the InternVL-3.5-30B-A3B and Intern-S1-mini models. On the HiPhO benchmark, InternVL-3.5-30B-A3B performance improves from 18.3 to 22.6, while Intern-S1-mini sees an increase from 8.5 to 12.4 (utilizing Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct as the model-based verifier). Using Gemini-2.5-Flash as the verifier, the trained Intern-S1-mini achieves one silver and ten bronze medals, an improvement over the baseline of ten bronze medals. These consistent improvements demonstrate that our RL training strategy is effective in eliciting the models latent capabilities in scientific reasoning. A.2. Case Study I: Text+Variable Figure This case study examines complex problem from the 2025 International Physics Olympiad (IPhO), which investigates the physical principles of Coxs 18th-century timepiecean ingenious device that harnesses atmospheric pressure fluctuations to generate energy. The problem requires understanding the figure information to determine the states of the tubes and the behaviors, and analyzing the table information. The P1-VL-235B-A22B model achieved perfect score (1.0/1.0) on this problem, demonstrating strong capabilities in: Physical intuition: Correctly identifying the critical force balance constraint at the stop position. Visual-Structural Alignment: Accurately translating the schematic representation of the tube states (liquid levels and gas volumes) into precise hydrostatic equations, effectively bridging visual features with symbolic reasoning. Tabular Information Integration: Synthesizing discrete parameters from the provided table to constrain the variables, specifically extracting the dimensional specifications required to calculate the total work done. Long-horizon Logical Reasoning: Sustaining coherent derivation chain to link atmospheric pressure fluctuations with mechanical energy storage, correctly applying the Ideal Gas Law without hallucinating non-existent constraints. This performance demonstrates P1-VLs proficiency in tackling competition-level physics problems, requiring synergy of deep physical understanding, rigorous analytical reasoning, and precise diagrammatic interpretation. IPhO 2025 Question 2-A.1 Background: In 1765, British clockmaker James Cox invented clock whose only source of energy is the fluctuations in atmospheric pressure. Coxs clock used two vessels containing mercury. Changes in atmospheric pressure caused mercury to move between the vessels, and the two vessels to move relative to each other. This movement acted as an energy source for the actual clock. We propose an analysis of this device. Throughout, we assume that the Earths gravitational field (cid:174)𝑔 = 𝑔 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 is uniform with 𝑔 = 9.8m s2 and (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 unit vector; all liquids are incompressible and their density is denoted 𝑟ℎ𝑜; no surface tension effects will be considered; - the variations of atmospheric pressure with altitude are neglected; 26 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads the surrounding temperature 𝑇a is uniform and all transformations are isothermal. We first consider bath of water that occupies the semi-infinite space 𝑧 0. The air above it is at pressure 𝑃a = 𝑃0. cylindrical vertical tube of length 𝐻 = 1m, cross-sectional area 𝑆 = 10cm2 and mass 𝑚 = 0.5kg is dipped into the bath. The bottom end of the tube is open, and the top end of the tube is closed. We denote ℎ the altitude of the top of the tube and 𝑧ℓ that of the water inside the tube. The thickness of the tube walls is neglected. We start from the situation where the tube in Figure 11 contains no gas and its top is at the bath level: in other words, ℎ = 0 and 𝑧𝑙 = 0 (case a). The tube is then slowly lifted until its bottom end reaches the bath level. The pulling force exerted on the tube is denoted (cid:174)𝐹 = 𝐹(cid:174)𝑢𝑧. Figure 11 Sketch of the tube in different configurations Question: For the configuration shown in Figure 11 (case b), determine the expressions for: 1. The pressure 𝑃𝑤 in the water at the top of the tube 2. The force (cid:174)𝐹 necessary to maintain the tube at this position Given data: 𝑃0, 𝜌, 𝑚, 𝑆, ℎ, 𝑔 and (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 P1-VL Solution Overview To analyze the situation for case in Coxs timepiece, we consider the vertical tube of length 𝐻, cross-sectional area 𝑆, and mass 𝑚, lifted so that its bottom end is at the bath surface (𝑧 = 0) and its top is at altitude ℎ. In this configuration, the water level inside the tube is at the same height as the top of the tube, i.e., 𝑧ℓ = ℎ, indicating that the tube is completely filled with water. (A.1) 𝑃w and (cid:174)𝐹 The tube is sealed at the top and open at the bottom, and the water inside is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The pressure at the bottom of the tube (at 𝑧 = 0) must equal the atmospheric pressure 𝑃0, as the tube is open to the bath at this level. 27 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Using the hydrostatic pressure law, the pressure at any height 𝑧 inside the water column is given by: At the top of the tube, where 𝑧 = ℎ, the pressure in the water is: 𝑃(𝑧) = 𝑃0 𝜌𝑔𝑧 𝑃w = 𝑃0 𝜌𝑔ℎ (11) (12) This result reflects that the pressure at the top of the water column is reduced by the weight of the water column of height ℎ. To determine the force (cid:174)𝐹 necessary to hold the tube in place, we perform force balance on the tube alone. Forces on the Tube: Gravitational force: The tube has mass 𝑚, so its weight is 𝑚𝑔 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧. Pressure forces: The atmospheric pressure 𝑃0 acts downward on the top cap of the tube, exerting force 𝑃0𝑆 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧.The water pressure 𝑃w at the top of the tube acts upward on the inner surface of the cap, exerting force +𝑃w𝑆 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧. Applied force: (cid:174)𝐹 is applied upward to maintain equilibrium. Thus, the net pressure force on the tube is: (𝑃w 𝑃0)𝑆 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 = 𝜌𝑔ℎ𝑆 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 (13) This is downward force due to the pressure difference between the outside atmosphere and the water column inside the tube. The net force on the tube must be zero: (cid:174)𝐹 + (𝑃w 𝑃0)𝑆 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 𝑚𝑔 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 = (cid:174)0 Substituting 𝑃w = 𝑃0 𝜌𝑔ℎ: (cid:174)𝐹 𝜌𝑔ℎ𝑆 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 𝑚𝑔 (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 = (cid:174)0 (cid:174)𝐹 = (𝑚𝑔 + 𝜌𝑔ℎ𝑆) (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 (14) (15) This result is physically intuitive: the force required to hold the tube in place must counteract both the tubes own weight and the net downward pressure force due to the difference between atmospheric pressure and the reduced pressure at the top of the water column. Answer: 𝑃w = 𝑃0 𝜌𝑔ℎ (cid:174)𝐹 = (𝑚𝑔 + 𝜌𝑔ℎ𝑆) (cid:174)𝑢𝑧 IPhO 2025 Question 2-A.2 Background: Three experiments are performed. In each, the tube is lifted from the initial state shown in Figure 11(a) under the conditions specified in Figure 12. P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Figure 12 Experimental conditions and numerical values of physical quantities for each experiment (𝑃sat designates the saturated vapour pressure of the pure fluid) In each case, we study the evolution of the force 𝐹 that must be applied in order to maintain the tube in equilibrium at an altitude ℎ, the external pressure being fixed at 𝑃a = 𝑃0 = 1.000105 Pa. Two different behaviours are possible Figure 13 Two different behaviours Question: For each experiment, complete the table in the answer sheet to indicate the expected behaviour and the numerical values for 𝐹max and for ℎ (when pertinent), where 𝐹max and ℎ are defined in the figures illustrating the two behaviours. P1-VL Solution Overview To determine the behavior of the tube during lifting and the corresponding values of 𝐹max and ℎ, we analyze the pressure equilibrium and the conditions under which vaporization (cavitation) occurs. (A.2) Answer Sheet The vertical cylinder, sealed at the top and open at the bottom, is lifted from the bath (where ℎ = 0) to the position where its bottom end reaches the surface (i.e., ℎ = 𝐻 = 1 m). The pressure at the top of the tube is governed by: Cavitation (formation of vapor) occurs when 𝑃top = 𝑃sat, i.e., when: 𝑃top = 𝑃0 𝜌𝑔ℎ ℎ = 𝑃0 𝑃sat 𝜌𝑔 (16) (17) 29 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Behavior occurs when ℎ > 𝐻, meaning the tube remains completely filled with liquid throughout the lifting process (𝑧ℓ = ℎ). Behavior occurs when ℎ < 𝐻, meaning the water column inside the tube stops rising at ℎ, and the top of the tube continues to rise while the water level inside remains at 𝑧ℓ = ℎ. The force 𝐹 required to hold the tube in equilibrium is given by: For Behavior A, 𝑃top = 𝑃0 𝜌𝑔ℎ, so: 𝐹 = 𝑚𝑔 + (𝑃0 𝑃top)𝑆 At ℎ = 𝐻, 𝐹 = 𝑚𝑔 + 𝜌𝑔𝑆ℎ 𝐹max = 𝑚𝑔 + 𝜌𝑔𝑆𝐻 For Behavior B, once ℎ > ℎ, 𝑃top = 𝑃sat, so: 𝐹max = 𝑚𝑔 + (𝑃0 𝑃sat)𝑆 Data Recap Cross-sectional area: 𝑆 = 10 cm2 = 1 103 m2 Mass of the tube: 𝑚 = 0.5 kg Gravitational acceleration: 𝑔 = 9.8 m/s2 Atmospheric pressure: 𝑃0 = 1.000 105 Pa Experiment 1: Water at 20C 𝜌 = 1.00 103 kg/m3 𝑃sat = 2.34 103 Pa (18) (19) (20) (21) ℎ = 1.000 105 2.34 103 1.00 103 9.8 9.96 > 𝐻 (22) Behavior 𝐹max = 𝑚𝑔 + 𝜌𝑔𝑆𝐻 = 0.5 9.8 + 1.00 103 9.8 1 103 = 4.9 + 9.8 = 14.7 (23) Experiment 2: Water at 80C 𝜌 = 0.97 103 kg/m3 𝑃sat = 47.4 103 Pa ℎ = 1.000 105 47.4 103 0.97 103 9.8 5.53 > 𝐻 (24) Behavior 𝐹max = 𝑚𝑔 + 𝜌𝑔𝑆𝐻 = 4.9 + 0.97 103 9.8 1 103 4.9 + 9.506 = 14.4 (25) Experiment 3: Water at 99C 𝜌 = 0.96 103 kg/m3 𝑃sat = 99.8 103 Pa ℎ = 1.000 105 99.8 103 0.96 103 9.8 0.0213 = 2.1 cm < 𝐻 (26) Behavior 𝐹max = 𝑚𝑔 + (𝑃0 𝑃sat)𝑆 = 4.9 + (200)(1 103) = 4.9 + 0.2 = 5.1 (27) 30 P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads Answer: Experiment Behaviour (A or B?) 1 2 3 ℎ (cm) None None 2.1 𝐹max (N) 14.7 14.4 5."
