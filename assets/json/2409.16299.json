            "content": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in assisting with various coding tasks, ranging from code generation and completion to bug fixing and refactoring. These models have transformed the way developers interact with code, providing powerful tools that can understand and generate human-like code snippets with impressive accuracy. However, as software engineering tasks grow in complexity, there is an emerging need for more sophisticated solutions that can handle the intricacies of real-world software development. Software agents built on LLMs have emerged as promising solution to automate complex software engineering tasks, leveraging the advanced reasoning and generative abilities of LLMs. These agents can handle tasks such as code generation, bug localization, and orchestrating multi-step development processes. However, most current agents are limited in scope, typically focused on specific SE task, such as resolving GitHub issues (Jimenez et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Arora et al., 2024; Xia et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Yang et al., 2024) using benchmarks like SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2023), or tackling competitive code generation tasks like APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021a), and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021). Other agents (Qian et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2024) focus on generating complex software based on requirements. While these specialized agents excel in their domains, their claim of addressing general software engineering tasks is often overstated, as real-world SE challenges require more versatility across tasks, languages, and development scenarios. To address such drawbacks, we propose HYPERAGENT, generalist multi-agent system designed to resolve broad spectrum of SE tasks. Our design philosophy is rooted in the workflows that software engineers typically follow in their daily routineswhether its implementing new features in an existing codebase, localizing bugs in large project, or providing fixes for reported issues and so on. While developers may use different tools or approaches to tackle these tasks, they generally adhere Corresponding author: bdqnghi@gmail.com 1 Figure 1: Illustration of Developers Workflow for Resolving Software Engineering Task. The diagram outlines the key phases developer typically follows when implementing new feature, such as adding Dark Mode to web application. to consistent workflow patterns. We illustrate this concept through workflow that represents how developers typically resolve coding tasks. Although different SE tasks require varied approaches, they all follow similar workflow. Figure 1 illustrates typical workflow for software engineer when resolving task from the backlog, which is list of tasks to be completed within specific period. 1. Analysis & Plan: The developer starts by understanding the task requirements through documentation review and stakeholder discussions. working plan is then formulated, outlining key steps, potential challenges, and expected outcomes. This plan remains flexible, adjusting as new insights are gained or challenges arise. 2. Feature Localization: With plan in place, the developer navigates the repository to identify relevant components, known as feature localization (Michelon et al., 2021; Martinez et al., 2018; Castro et al., 2019). This involves locating classes, functions, libraries, or modules pertinent to the task. Understanding dependencies and the systems overall design is crucial to make informed decisions later. 3. Edition: The developer edits the identified code components, implementing changes or adding new functionality. This phase also involves ensuring smooth integration with the existing codebase, maintaining code quality, and adhering to best practices. 4. Execution: After editing, the developer tests the modified code to verify it meets the plans requirements. This includes running unit and integration tests, as well as conducting manual testing or peer reviews. If issues are found, the process loops back to previous phases until the task is fully resolved. These four steps are repeated until the developer confirms task completion. The exact process may vary depending on the task and the developers skill level; some tasks are completed in one phase, while others require multiple iterationsif the developer is unsatisfied after the Execution step, the entire process may repeat. In HYPERAGENT, the framework is organized around four primary agents: Planner, Navigator, Code Editor, and Executor, as illustrated in Figure 2. Each agent corresponds to specific step in the workflow shown in Figure 1, though their workflows may differ slightly from how human developer might approach similar tasks.1. Our design emphasizes three main advantages over existing methods: (1) Generalizability, the framework adapts easily to various tasks with minimal configuration, requiring little additional effort to incorporate new modules, 1Details about each agent, along with how these advantages are achieved, are provided in Sections 4 2 (2) Efficiency, agents are optimized for processes with varying complexity, employing lightweight LLMs for tasks like navigation and more advanced models for code editing and execution and (3) Scalability, the system scales effectively in real-world scenarios with numerous subtasks, handling complex tasks efficiently. Experimental results (See Section 5) highlight HYPERAGENT unique position as the first system capable of working off-the-shelf across diverse software engineering tasks and programming languages, often exceeding specialized systems performance. Its versatility positions HYPERAGENT as transformative tool for real-world software development. In summary, the key contributions of this work include: Introduction of HYPERAGENT , generalist multi-agent system that closely mimics typical software engineering workflows and is able to handle broad spectrum of software engineering tasks across different programming languages. Extensive evaluation demonstrating superior performance across various software engineering benchmarks, including Github issue resolution (SWE-Bench-Python), repository-level code generation (RepoExec-Python), and fault localization and program repair (Defects4J-Java). To our knowledge, HYPERAGENT is the first system designed to work off-the-shelf across diverse SE tasks in multiple programming languages without task-specific adaptations. Insights into the design and implementation of scalable, efficient, and generalizable software engineering agent systems, paving the way for more versatile AI-assisted development tools that can seamlessly integrate into various stages of the software lifecycle."

            "content": "In recent years, applying deep learning to automated programming has captured significant interest within the research community (Balog et al., 2016; Bui & Jiang, 2018; Bui et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Allamanis et al., 2018; Bui et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2020; 2022b). Specifically, Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) have emerged as specialized branch of LLMs, fine-tuned for programming tasks (Wang et al., 2021; 2023; Feng et al., 2020; Allal et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Lozhkov et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Pinnaparaju et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Roziere et al., 2023; Nijkamp et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2022; Bui et al., 2022). These models have become foundational in building AI-assisted tools for developers, aiming to solve competitive coding problems from benchmarks such as HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021b), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), APPs (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and CRUXEval Gu et al.

However, these benchmarks often remain limited to short, self-contained code problems, typically requiring basic language primitives. As LMs advance, many benchmarks are becoming saturated, prompting need for more complex tasks involving deeper reasoning and problem-solving. Efforts like SWEbench (Jimenez et al., 2023) simulate GitHub issue resolution, while Defects4J (Just et al., 2014) and BugsInPy (Widyasari et al., 2020) focus on fault localization and repair. CodeXGlue (Lu et al., 2021) provides broad benchmark covering various software engineering tasks."

(2024); Jimenez et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2024b); Xia et al. (2024). Integrating these tools into workflows has significantly improved code generation performance on benchmarks like HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021b). Notable contributions include Huang et al. (2023), Chen et al. 3 (2023), Shinn et al. (2024), Islam et al. (2024), Chen et al. (2022), and To et al. (2024). Additionally, research on generating complex software systems from requirements has led to MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2023), AgileCoder (Nguyen et al., 2024), and ChatDev (Qian et al., 2024), aiming to automate broader aspects of software development beyond single-file generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in using coding agents to automatically resolve GitHub issues, addressing real-world software engineering challenges. Key works in this area include SWEAgent (Yang et al., 2024), SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2023), AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024b), and agentless approaches (Xia et al., 2024). This shift towards agent-based models bridges academic benchmarks with practical software engineering, fostering more sophisticated AI-assisted development tools that mimic human problem-solving in coding tasks.

            "content": "The HYPERAGENT framework comprises four primary agents: Planner The Planner agent serves as the central decision-making unit. It processes human task prompts, generates resolution strategies, and coordinates child agent activities. The Planner operates iteratively, generating plans, delegating subtasks, and processing feedback until task completion or predefined iteration limit is reached. 4 Navigator The Navigator agent specializes in efficient information retrieval within the codebase. Equipped with IDE-like tools such as go to definition and code search, it traverses codebases rapidly, addressing challenges associated with private or unfamiliar code repositories. The Navigator is designed for speed and lightweight operation, utilizing combination of simple tools to yield comprehensive search results. Editor The Editor agent is responsible for code modification and generation across multiple files. It employs tools including auto repair editor, code search, and open file. Upon receiving target file and context information from the Planner, the Editor generates code patches, which are then applied using the auto repair editor. Executor The Executor agent validates solutions and reproduces reported issues. It utilizes an interactive bash shell for maintaining execution states and open file for accessing relevant documentation. The Executor manages environment setup autonomously, facilitating efficient testing and validation processes."

            "content": "Inter-agent communication in HYPERAGENT is optimized to minimize information loss, enable efficient task delegation, and support scalable parallel processing for complex software engineering tasks. This is achieved using an asynchronous communication model based on distributed Message Queue. The Planner communicates with child agents via standardized message format with two fields: Context (background and rationale) and Request (actionable instructions). Tasks are broken down into subtasks and published to specific queues. Child agents, such as Navigator, Editor, and Executor instances, monitor these queues and process tasks asynchronously, enabling parallel execution and significantly improving scalability and efficiency. For example, multiple Navigator instances can explore different parts of large codebase in parallel, the Editor can apply changes across multiple files simultaneously, and the Executor can run tests concurrently, accelerating validation. lightweight LLM summarizer 2 compiles and condenses execution logs from child agents, ensuring minimal information loss. Summaries, including key details like code snippets and explored objects, are sent back to the Planner via the Message Queue for aggregation. The Message Queue provides several advantages: (1) Parallel task execution increases throughput, (2) Dynamic task distribution optimizes resources, (3) Failed tasks are requeued for reliability, (4) Easy scalability through additional agents, and (5) The decoupled architecture allows independent scaling of the Planner and agents. This scalable, asynchronous model allows HYPERAGENT to handle complex SE tasks in distributed environments, adapting to fluctuating workloads and task complexities, making it ideal for real-world software development."

We classify SE tasks into two categories: Patch tasks, which require code editing, and Prediction tasks, which do not. To streamline the configuration process, the Editor agent is excluded from the workflow for Prediction tasks, ensuring more efficient and robust execution. Each task is instantiated using task template, which minimally specifies the required information for that task (e.g., GitHub issue text for Issue Resolution or error trace for Defects4J Fault Localization) along with general instructions. These templates are then populated with task-specific data and easily integrated into the HYPERAGENT system with little additional configuration. The workflow is illustrated in Figure 1, with detailed task templates provided in Appendix A.1."

We tested four main configurations of HYPERAGENT , each utilizing different combinations of LLMs for the Planner, Navigator, Editor, and Executor roles (See the configurations in Appendix A.2, Table 7). An advantage of our design is the ability to select the most suitable LLMs for each agent type, optimizing performance and accuracy. The Planner, as the systems brain, requires powerful model with superior reasoning to manage complex tasks, while the Editor needs robust coding capabilities for accurate code editing and generation. In contrast, the Navigator and Executor can use less powerful models with faster inference times since their tasks are more straightforward. This flexible architecture enables efficient allocation of computational resources, balancing model capability and cost, and allows for easier updates to individual components without overhauling the entire system. As result, we can implement various configurations of HYPERAGENT as shown in Table 7 (Appendix A.2), utilizing both open-source and closed-source models."

Overall, HYPERAGENT achieves 249 plausible fixes and 192 correct fixes, corresponding to an impressive 29.8% plausible fix rate and 22.9% correct fix rate, significantly outperforming RepairAgent (19.64%), SelfAPR (13.17%), and ITER (6.82%) across the board."

            "content": "We conducted experiments using SWE-bench Tiny to evaluate the contribution of each agent role to overall performance. This was done by replacing each child agent with the planner itself, requiring the planner to directly utilize the eliminated agents toolset. Table 5 illustrates significant cost increase for all configurations when any agent role is removed. The resolving rate also decreases, with the magnitude varying based on which role is eliminated. Removing the Navigator causes the most substantial performance drop, followed by the Editor and the Executor, respectively. Additionally, when medium-long context length LLM acts as the Planner and replaces the role of Editor or Navigator, we observe more severe drop in the resolving rate. This is attributed to these roles requiring continuous interaction with the environment, necessitating long context."

For open file, small LLMs like Claude Haiku tend to scroll up and down multiple times to find desired snippets by continuously increasing start line and end line, leading to out-of-context length issues. We addressed this by adding an additional input field keywords, allowing the LLM to search keywords inside the file. This enables the tool to quickly localize the positions of keywords inside the file and display the surrounding lines, increasing the resolving rate by 3%. Without code search, the Navigator faces significant challenges in swiftly identifying necessary objects, resulting in substantially lower performance rate of 3% compared to 8% when the tool is employed. Enhancing the output to include partial surrounding context around the keyword enables the Navigator to make more informed decisions, improving performance from 8% to 11%. Prioritizing search results for key objects such as functions and classes, and re-ranking these results further enhances overall performance, increasing it from 11% to 14%. Figure 3: Error Analysis"

Figure 4 illustrates typical pattern where the Planner is most active at the beginning of the resolution process, gathering relevant information about the codebase environment. Subsequently, the Editor is frequently used to generate patches, often immediately following the Navigator, with notable peaks at Iterations 4 and 8. Finally, the Executor is requested more frequently in the later iterations to verify the results by executing tests. It is noteworthy that, in the first iteration, there is small peak indicating that the Executor is requested to reproduce the issue."

HYPERAGENT has lower Edit failed loop error ratio compared to SWE-Agent Jimenez et al. (2023) due to use automatic code repair. HYPERAGENT also has problem of early exit (due to hallucination that the task has been solved) and exit timeout. Hallucination could be appeared in the framework since the communica10 tion between agents can lose details about real execution result or context location making Planner hard to be grounded with main task."

            "content": "In this paper, we introduced HYPERAGENT , generalist multi-agent system designed to address wide range of software engineering tasks. By closely mimicking typical software engineering workflows, HYPERAGENT incorporates stages for analysis, planning, feature localization, code editing, and execution/verification. Our extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks, including GitHub issue resolution, code generation at repository-level scale, and fault localization and program repair, demonstrate that HYPERAGENT not only matches but often exceeds the performance of specialized systems. The success of HYPERAGENT highlights the potential of generalist approaches in software engineering, offering versatile tool that can adapt to various tasks with minimal configuration changes. Its design emphasizes generalizability, efficiency, and scalability, making it well-suited for real-world software development scenarios where tasks can vary significantly in complexity and scope. Future work could explore the integration of HYPERAGENT with existing development environments and version control systems to further streamline the software engineering process. Additionally, investigating the potential of HYPERAGENT in more specialized domains, such as securityfocused code review or performance optimization, could expand its applicability. Enhancing the systems explainability and providing more detailed insights into its decision-making process could also improve trust and adoption among developers. Finally, exploring techniques to continually update and refine the systems knowledge base with the latest programming paradigms and best practices could ensure its long-term relevance in the rapidly evolving field of software engineering."

For closed-source models, we designate GPT-4 and Claude-3 Sonnet as the stronger models, while Claude-3 Haiku serves as the weaker model. In the open-source space, Llama-3-70B functions as the stronger model, with Llama-3-8B as the weaker counterpart. We believe that HYPERAGENT is the first system to evaluate SWE-Bench using opensource models like Llama-3, providing more cost-efficient alternative to closed-source solutions while still delivering competitive performance across variety of software engineering tasks.

If the number of results is insufficient, the function also searches code line by line to find matches in less structured code. The output is concise summary of the search results, including file names, identifiers, and code snippets, which LLMs can easily interpret.

Built atop the Language Server Protocol (LSP) infrastructure, it enables an LLM to search through source files, identify the symbols location, and return its definition, all while maintaining adherence to the structure of the programming language in use. At the heart of the tools functionality is the LSPToolKit, which serves as natural language middleware between LLMs and LSP servers. This middleware abstracts the complexities of interacting with LSP backends, allowing the LLM to work with multiple programming languages without needing to comprehend the unique protocols of each. By offering consistent interface, LSPToolKit enables seamless communication with LSP servers for languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Java, making the tool adaptable to variety of codebases across different languages. When an LLM triggers go to definition, it initiates search for the symbol in the specified file, with the option to refine the search using line numbers. The LSPToolKit then communicates with the relevant LSP server, retrieves the symbols definition through syntactic and semantic analysis, and presents the information in format easily interpretable by the LLM. If verbose output is enabled, the tool can provide additional details such as symbol documentation, code snippets with line numbers, and preview of the symbols definition. For lengthy definitions, the tool can suggest displaying partial content for easier readability. This tool proves particularly beneficial in scenarios where LLMs are tasked with code refactoring, debugging, or generating new code based on existing elements. By automating the search and retrieval of symbol definitions, and bridging LLMs with multiple LSP backends, the tool enhances the LLMs capability to assist developers in efficiently exploring codebases, while ensuring languagespecific details are accurately conveyed and presented."

Similarly with go to definition, by leveraging the Language Server Protocol (LSP) through the LSPToolKit, the tool allows agents to find references to symbol, enabling efficient navigation and understanding of how that symbol is used throughout the project. The tool operates by providing the name of the symbol, the relative file path, and optionally, the line number where the symbol is located. Upon execution, the get all refs tool queries the LSP server for all references to the given symbol within the specified file and across the project. This tool is particularly valuable for tasks like debugging or constructing new features via extending base classes, where an agent needs to track the usage of specific symbols throughout project. By automating the process of finding and returning all references, the tool allows agent to efficiently analyze how code elements are interconnected, significantly improving the agents ability to assist developers in complex code exploration tasks."

Un23 like many other tools that rely on Language Server Protocol (LSP) for symbol extraction, this tool leverages ctags 5 for fast, parallel processing of symbol data. The get all symbols tool is built to allow LLM agent to navigate through codebase and locate key symbols efficiently. It takes as input the path to source file and an optional keyword to filter symbols based on specific search term. This keyword-based filtering ensures more focused and relevant symbol extraction, allowing developers to quickly identify functions or classes that match particular term. The tool supports multiple programming languages and uses ctags to analyze files without the overhead of setting up an LSP server, making it ideal for lightweight symbol extraction tasks. Upon execution, get all symbols calls ctags to generate list of all the symbols in file, including their line numbers, names, and definitions. The tool then parses the output from ctags to identify primary symbols like functions, classes, and methods, which are then formatted into human-readable string, including line numbers and definitions, when necessary. If keyword is provided, the tool filters the symbols based on that keyword, prioritizing exact matches over partial matches to reduce redundant results. The output includes the symbol names, their start and end lines, and their definitions if they are relatively short. In verbose mode, the tool can display additional details about each symbols location and content. This makes it particularly useful for developers or LLMs tasked with understanding the structure of codebase or performing code refactoring. By using ctags, which is known for its efficiency and speed, get all symbols can handle large codebases quickly, providing reliable symbol data without the need for complex LSP interactions. This makes it valuable tool for tasks such as code analysis, quick symbol location, or simply understanding the high-level structure of source file."

For these reasons, this tool is most common used by HYPERAGENT and also has the most complex design and has wide heuristics to ensure that agent be able to examine the code context in errorprone manner. This tool is designed to facilitate code exploration by allowing users to either specify keywords for targeted searches or define start and end lines to view specific content. It also supports semantic search queries to locate relevant parts of the code based on contextual meaning. The tool operates by taking in relative file path and optional keywords or line ranges. It returns the content of the file within the specified bounds or matches lines containing the given keywords. Additionally, the tool can use semantic model to find code segments that closely match query, allowing for flexible code exploration beyond simple keyword search. This functionality makes the open file particularly useful for understanding codebases and inspecting file contents efficiently without opening entire files. 25 If the file is not found, the tool provides helpful suggestions to guide the agent in locating the correct path. Furthermore, the tool is capable of returning file segments limited by the maximum number of lines to prevent overwhelming output, ensuring focused code analysis and reduce context length."

It allows editor agent to specify file, define range of lines to edit, and provide replacement code patch. The tool ensures that the new code maintains proper syntax, indentation, and alignment with the original code. Upon execution, the tool opens the specified file, extracts the original block of code between the start and end lines, and replaces it with the provided patch. The tool checks for common issues such as incorrect file paths, line range errors, and invalid code syntax. It supports code review processes, using an integrated LLM to verify the proposed patch before applying it to the file. Additionally, the tool can automatically format the file and check for syntax errors using utilities like autopep8 and flake8 for Python, ensuring that the edited code adheres to best practices. If no errors are detected, the tool applies the patch to the file and saves it. If issues are found, it outputs detailed error message to help the integrated LLM resolve the problems, guiding further adjustments to the code. If the integrated LLM is unable to fix errors, the tool will return the error message and before-after code snippets 27 This tool is highly useful for applying bug fixes, and performing precise modifications in large codebases."

SWE-bench assesses systems capability to automatically resolve GitHub issues using Issue-Pull Request (PR) pairs, with evaluation based on verifying unit tests against the post-PR behavior as the reference solution. Due to the original benchmarks size and the presence of underspecified issue descriptions, we utilized two refined versions: SWE-bench-Lite (300 instances) and SWE-bench-Verified (500 instances). The Lite version filters samples through heuristics (e.g., removing instances with images, external hyperlinks, or short descriptions), while the Verified version contains samples manually validated by professional annotators. These streamlined versions offer more focused and reliable evaluation framework, addressing the limitations of the original benchmark while maintaining its core objectives. Baselines We compared HYPERAGENT to several strong baselines: SWE-Agent (Yang et al., 2024), bash interactive agent with Agent-Computer Interfaces; AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024b), two-stage agent pipeline focusing on bug fixing scenarios; Agentless (Xia et al., 2024), simplified two-phase approach that outperforms complex agent-based systems in software development tasks; and various Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) baselines as presented in (Jimenez et al., 2023). These baselines represent diverse range of approaches to software engineering tasks, providing comprehensive evaluation framework for our method. Metrics We evaluate this task using three key metrics: (1) percentage of resolved instances, (2) average time cost, and (3) average token cost. The percentage of resolved instances measures overall effectiveness, indicating the proportion of SWE-bench tasks where the model generates solutions passing all unit tests, thus fixing the described GitHub issue. Average time cost assesses efficiency in processing and resolving issues, while average token cost quantifies economic efficacy through computational resource usage. These metrics collectively provide comprehensive evaluation of each tools performance in addressing real-world software problems, balancing success rate with time and resource utilization. A.4.2 REPOSITORY-LEVEL CODE GENERATION DETAILS Dataset We evaluate our task using RepoExec (Hai et al., 2024), benchmark for Python for assessing repository-level code generation with emphasis on executability and correctness. Comprising 355 samples with automatically generated test cases (96.25% coverage), RepoExec typically provides gold contexts extracted through static analysis. The gold contexts are splitted into different richness level, including full context, medium context and small context. The richness level of contexts represent for different way to retrieve the contexts, such as import, docstring, function signature, API invocaction, etc. However, to measure HYPERAGENTs ability to navigate codebases and extract contexts independently, we omit these provided contexts in our evaluation. Baselines We compared HYPERAGENT against strong retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) baselines, including WizardLM2 + RAG, GPT-3.5-Turbo + RAG, WizardLM2 + Sparse RAG, and GPT3.5-Turbo + Sparse RAG. These baselines represent state-of-the-art approaches in combining large language models with information retrieval techniques. Sparse RAG represents for using BM25 retriever and RAG stands for using UnixCoder Guo et al. (2022a) as context retriever. We used chunking size of 600 and python code parser from Langchain 6 allowing us to parse the context in syntax-aware manner. Additionally, we included results from CodeLlama (34b and 13b versions) and StarCoder models when provided with full context from RepoExec, serving as upper bounds for performance with complete information. Metrics We used pass@1 and pass@5 as our primary metric, which measures the percentage of instances where all tests pass successfully after applying the model-generated patch to the repository. A.4.3 FAULT LOCALIZATION Dataset We evaluated HYPERAGENT on the Defects4J dataset (Sobreira et al., 2018; Just et al., 2014), widely used benchmark for fault localization and program repair tasks. Our evaluation encompassed all 353 active bugs from Defects4J v1.0."

To handle ties in the ranking, we employ the 6https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain 30 ordinal tiebreaker method instead of the average tiebreaker, as we believe it more accurately reflects developers experience when using fault localization tool. A.5 PROGRAM REPAIR A.5.1 DATASET We also utilize the Defects4J dataset (Sobreira et al., 2018; Just et al., 2014). This dataset is particularly suitable as it provides gold-standard fixes and test cases, which are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of repair techniques once faults are localized and fixes are applied."

Youve been assigned specific task in large codebase repository. Your goal is to devise step-by-step plan to delegate work to three interns to efficiently resolve the issue. You have access to three specialized interns. Your plan should utilize their individual strengths to progressively solve the task, ensuring each step builds on the last. All decisions must be based on the data and results collected from the interns. Carefully analyze their feedback, adjust your approach as necessary, and make decisions accordingly. Interns Available: - Codebase Navigator: Provides insights about the codebase structure, dependencies, and specific file locations. - Codebase Editor: Modifies the code based on the localized problem and your instructions. - Executor: Reproduces issues, runs test cases, and validates whether the problem is resolved. Guidelines: 1. Sequential Decision Making: After receiving response from an intern, diversify the next subgoal to gather more informationavoid repeating actions. 2. Problem Localization: Prioritize identifying the root cause of the issue before instructing the Codebase Editor to make changes. 3. Focus on the Codebase: Do not concern yourself with editing test files or testing pull requestsfocus on solving the assigned task in the codebase. 4. Targeted Patching: Generate patch only after identifying the issue, its root cause, and gathering enough relevant knowledge. 5. Specific Requests: Provide clear and detailed requests to each intern, ensuring they understand the query context and the expected outcome. 6. Single Intern Tasking: Assign tasks to one intern at time to maintain clear focus on their individual roles. 7. Use the Executor Wisely: If unsure about the correctness of generated code, ask the Executor to run test cases or reproduce the issue. 8. No Role Mixing: Dont mix intern rolesNavigator should not edit code, and the Editor should not run tests. Key Steps: 1. Understand the Query: Begin by reading the problem description carefully. Identify the crucial components and expected behavior, especially focusing on error traces and logs. 2. Verify and Reflect: After receiving each interns response, critically evaluate the information gathered, ensuring that all key aspects of the problem are understood before moving forward. 3. Progressive Thought Process: Ensure your thought process is well-documented, clearly showing how each step and intern feedback influences your next action. The goal is to progressively build towards solution. 4. Task Resolution: End the task once the problem is resolved, verified, and you have confidence in the final outcome. Expected Output Format: - Thought: Your detailed analysis of the task, observations, and how your adaptive plan will resolve the issue based on feedback from the interns. - Intern Name: Select one of the interns (Navigator, Editor, Executor). - Subgoal: Provide specific and detailed request for the intern, including hints, relevant code snippets, file paths, or any necessary instructions.

The header_rows parameter is used to specify the column names to be used as header rows in the table .
