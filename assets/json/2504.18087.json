            "content": "Following the commonly used generative models, GAN-based THG methods [21, 42] have achieved remarkable results in generating high-resolution videos through adversarial training between generators and discriminators, particularly in terms of visual quality and lip-sync accuracy. Diffusion model-based THG methods [25, 27], on the other hand, excel in generating high-quality and high-resolution images and videos, and it outperforms GANs in terms of the stability and consistency of the generated content, thus becoming the mainstream methods for THG. These methods xx, xx, xx largely facilitate THG by strengthening the explicit controlling conditions such as facial keypoints and head motion sequences. Yet, critical gap persists: none of these methods holistically model emotion as controllable, multimodal signal. Ignoring such condition forces models to generate \"emotionally flat\" outputs, limiting their applicability in fields like mental health support, where emotional resonance is critical. While it is straightforward to transfer the previous exploration on emotion control such as EAMM [13] and StyleTalk [19] to diffusion backbones, these methods are generally restricted with three main omissions leading to incomprehensive control. (1) Wrongly dominant visual emotion. EAMM and StyleTalk propose adopting videos as the emotion source. However, audio as the elementary input of THG contain rich affective emotion cues such as the prosody and spectral tilt. For example, one can easily tell apart if someone is happy or sad by only listening to him speaking. Lack of such information can severely haunt the comprehensiveness of the emotion representation. (2) Leaked identity characteristics. Existing methods often fail to disentangle emotion from speaker identity, allowing unintended facial features (e.g., unique expressions or micro-movements) to leak into the generated output. This issue stems from treating emotions as fixed, universal attributes while overlooking the identity-specific volatility. For instance, the same emotion (e.g., happiness) may manifest differently across individuals due to unique facial structures or habitual mannerisms. Without explicit modeling of this volatility, transferred emotions may retain source-specific artifacts, compromising both generalization and fidelity when applied to novel identities. Failure to take into account such fact degrades the generalizability of emotion transfer, especially when adapting to unseen identities. (3) Isolated emotion learning. Previous methods generally produce emotion representation based on single source video without extra knowledge. However, different emotions are actually correlated with each other. For example, learning emotions like sad and contempt can help model better understand other negative emotions such as disgusted. Such correlation, anyhow, is yet to be explored. To this end, we propose novel framework named DICE-Talk, which can effectively extract well-disentangled emotion features with the assistance of audio information through self-supervised method, and apply them to the generation of talking head videos in manner suitable for diffusion models. This approach not only improves the overall quality of the generated videos, ensuring better synchronization and control but also accurately transfers facial expressions and individualized details to new faces. Specifically, our DICE-Talk focuses on two main problems, i.e. extracting emotion embeddings and controlling diffusion models with such embeddings. For emotion embedding extraction, we propose the novel disentangled emotion embedder as an alternative to the previous methods such as StyleTalk based on the transformer backbone. Concretely, the audio and visual information of each video interacts with each other in the transformer emotion encoder, which models the emotion-related information of this video as Gaussian distribution with predicted mean and standard deviation, aiming to simultaneously learn the general emotion representation and the identity-specific volatility of this video. Through contrastive learning, the extracted features exhibit significant clustering across different identities and emotions, not only helping the model better understand the video content but also providing an effective way to capture and express the emotion of individuals. In order to control the denoising process with the well learned emotion representation, we propose leveraging an emotion bank module to fully explore the intrinsic correlation between different emotions to boost each other. Specifically, this emotion bank first imports knowledge from the extracted emotion representations, from which the informative ones are then aggregated and incorporated in the diffusion UNet through cross attention. This enables the model to actively utilize the emotion source from the training set, which leads to strong generalization ability of the trained model. To encourage the model to be better controlled by the emotion condition, we further utilize an emotion discrimination objective apart from the noise prediction loss. Our objective incorporates an emotion discriminator trained to classify affective states from intermediate noisy latents of the diffusion UNet, ensuring precise control without sacrificing lip-sync accuracy or visual fidelity. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments and comparisons on the MEAD [33], HDTF [43] and out-of-domain datasets. Our method significantly outperforms other competitors across multiple metrics, including FVD [28], FID [11], SyncNet (Sync-C and Sync-D) [8] and EmoScores. In addition to quantitative evaluation, we also perform comprehensive qualitative assessments. The results indicate that our method can generate highly natural and expressive talking videos and produce different emotions or even multiple changes in expressions within the same video according to user needs, achieving satisfactory visual effects. Overall, our contributions are summarized as follows: We propose DICE-Talk, the first audio-driven diffusion-based THG framework that disentangles speaker identity from emotional expressions. This enables realistic talking head generation with rich emotional expressions while preserving identity fidelity. We introduce cross-modal disentangled emotion embedder, representing emotions as identity-agnostic Gaussian distributions to address identity leakage and leverage audios inherent prosodic cues. correlation-enhanced emotion conditioning mechanism is proposed, which leverages learnable emotion bank to capture inter-emotion relationships."

Among these, X-Portrait [39] and MegActor [41] rely on the pose and expression from the source video to generate the target video, which limits their ability to produce videos based solely on audio. DiffTalk [25] was the first to modify lip movements using audio and diffusion models, but it does not extend to driving other head parts. EMO [27] was the first to leverage LDM [23] and audio features to achieve overall motion in portraits. V-Express [31] controls the overall motion amplitude by adjusting audio attention weights, while Hallo [40] designed hierarchical module to regulate the motion amplitude of different regions. Sonic [12] focus on global audio perception to obtain better talking head results. In summary, current audio-driven diffusion model approaches have not taken into account that each portrait should exhibit corresponding emotion while speaking, which is essential for generating higherquality portrait videos.

MEAD [33] and Emotion [26] directly inject style labels into the network to drive the corresponding emotions. GC-AVT [18] and EAMM [13] map the facial expressions of each frame in the source video to each frame in the target video. LSF [37] and StyleTalk [19] employ 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) to extract facial information and construct style codes that drive the desired styles.

Our method comprises three key components: disentangled emotion embedder, correlationenhanced emotion conditioning, and emotion discrimination objective. These architectural elements work synergistically to decouple identity representations from emotional cues while preserving facial articulation details, thereby generating lifelike animated portraits with emotionally nuanced expressions. identity information from emotion features due to insufficient capability via solely modeling deterministic emotion features. Therefore, such identity-related features would be leaked into the emotion embedding. Our method, on the other hand, model the emotion prior as Gaussian distribution that is more representative, thus learning better disentangled sequential embeddings. Embedder Training. Essentially, codes with similar emotions should cluster together in the emotion space. Therefore, we apply contrastive learning to the emotion priors by constructing positive pairs (𝑠, 𝑠𝑝 ) with the same identity and emotion, and negative pairs (𝑠, 𝑠𝑛) with different identities or emotions. Then, the InfoNCE loss [4] with similarity metric 𝜁 is enhanced between positive and negative sample pairs: 𝜔 ( 𝑠) = exp(𝜁 (𝑠, 𝑠)/𝜏), L𝑐𝑜𝑛 = log (cid:18) 𝜔 (𝑠𝑝 ) 𝜔 (𝑠𝑝 ) + (cid:205)𝑠𝑛 S𝑛 𝜔 (𝑠𝑛) (cid:19) , (7) (8)"

            "content": "In order to control the emotion of talking head videos, straightforward way is to directly inject 𝑠 achieved in Eq. 6 into SVD through cross attention, following other conditional diffusion models such as Sonic [12]. However, while 𝑠 can well depict the emotion condition of each video clip, it still cannot well handle the internal correlation among different emotions, which leads to limited performance. To address the problem, we propose correlation-enhanced emotion conditioning process via an emotion bank attention layer. Rather than directly leveraging information contained in 𝑠 as condition, we instead utilize an emotion bank R𝐾 𝑑𝑠 to first refine the emotion information. Specifically, during training, following previous works on discrete encoding, emotion memory 𝑠 is retrieved from based on the extracted emotion embedding 𝑠, whose information is further aggregated according to 𝑠: 𝑠 C𝑖 2 2, 𝑠 = C𝑘 ; 𝑘 = arg min 𝑖 𝑄𝑠 = 𝑊𝑄 (𝑠); 𝐾𝑠 = 𝑊𝐾 (𝑠); 𝑉𝑠 = 𝑊𝑉 (𝑠), 𝐸𝑆 = CA(𝑄𝑠, 𝐾𝑠, 𝑉𝑠 ), (9) (10) (11) where 𝜏 denotes temperature parameter, S𝑛 denotes all negative samples for 𝑠, and 𝜁 (𝑠𝑖, 𝑠 𝑗 ) is the cosine similarity between sample pairs (𝑠𝑖, 𝑠 𝑗 ). We additionally add fixed constant to stabilize the numerical range of the similarity and make the training process more stable. In the training of the disentangled emotion embedder, we directly train all parameters of this lightweight model. Meanwhile, we use random dropout trick when inputting emotion features 𝑠𝛽 and audio features 𝑠𝛼 by setting some of the emotion features 𝑠𝛽 or audio features 𝑠𝛼 to zero. This allows the model to obtain the emotion prior through single modality. By training with objectives such as commitment loss [29], it learns to memorize the shared emotion-related knowledge among the training set. Intuitively, embeddings with the same emotion would be clustered into similar 𝑠, which in turn reduces the effect of identity leakage. Consequently, the retrieval process matches the appropriate feature distribution for the specific input, thereby expressing the corresponding emotion. Additionally, this method can express entirely new emotions through combinations of different emotional features, providing better generalization. Moreover, the training process can encourage 𝑊𝑄,𝑊𝐾 ,𝑊𝑉 to discover latent subspaces where emotion correlations are salient, which further Disentangle Identity, Cooperate Emotion: Correlation-Aware Emotional Talking Portrait Generation xx, xx, xx benefits the generation process: After achieving well-trained C, the retrieval process can be skipped during inference, i.e. replacing 𝑠 in Eq. 10 with C, i.e. 𝑄𝑠 = 𝑊𝑄 (𝑠); 𝐾𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑊𝐾 (C); 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑊𝑉 (C), 𝐸𝑆 = CA(𝑄𝑠, 𝐾𝑎𝑙𝑙 , 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑙 ).

To utilize the emotion feature 𝐸𝑠 obtained in Sec. 3.2 and guide the denoising process, then 𝐸𝑠 is injected into the diffusion UNet through an additional emotion attention layer, where it interacts with other features via cross-attention mechanism to supplement additional facial details such as expressions and speaking habits. The information of the emotion feature 𝐸𝑠 can be injected into the spatial and temporal cross-attention layers to provide spatial knowledge as follows: 𝑧𝑠 = 𝑧𝑎 + CA (𝑄 (𝑧𝑎), 𝐾 (𝐸𝑠 ), 𝑉 (𝐸𝑠 )) , where 𝑧𝑎 is the spatial latent features after being injected with reference attention and audio attention, and 𝑧𝑠 is the adjusted spatial features guided by emotion prior spatial-aware level.

Emotion Discrimination Objective. To promote the model to generate more precise emotions, we introduce the emotion discrimination objective. Formally, denoting 𝑓𝑡 R(𝐶 𝐻 𝑊 ) 𝑑 as the intermediate features extracted from the U-Net at timestep 𝑡, where 𝐶, 𝐻,𝑊 represent channel, height, and width dimensions respectively.

To assess the accuracy of the generated facial expressions, we use the Emo-Score [24]. Specifically, we selected four easily recognizable emotionsneutral, happy, surprised, and angry (emotions like sad and fear are inherently more easily confused with other emotions)to evaluate the effectiveness of emotion generation. The average of these scores will be used as the overall Emo-Score. Additionally, we will compare the average scores of neutral and non-neutral emotions. As shown in Table 1, our method ranks among the top in metrics on both the MEAD and out-of-domain datasets. Our method achieved the best emotion scores, reflecting that our approach generates vivid and accurate facial expressions through emotion priors. In the quality assessment of videos, single-frame images, and lipsync accuracy, our method is close to the current best methods, as evidenced by the FVD, FID, and SyncNet scores. The results in Table 2 further indicate that our method maintains high visual quality even on datasets like HDTF, which do not have obvious emotions. These results demonstrate that our method can ensure video generation quality while achieving diversity and accuracy in emotional expression."

We\ncompared three approaches: without using emotion bank, without\nusing the emotion discrimination objective, and compute cross at-\ntention between learnable embeddings and the emotion prior. For a\nmore detailed evaluation, we additionally included the F-SIM [27]\nto assess the facial similarity between the generated video and the\nreference image. The experiments show that our method effectively\nenhances emotional expression capabilities while better preserving\nthe identity of the reference image. Table 4 presents the experimen-\ntal results of these schemes, indicating that both the emotion bank\nlearning and the emotion discrimination objective significantly\ncontribute to emotional expression and identity preservation, as\nreflected in the optimization of the F-SIM and Emo-Score metrics.\nDisentangled Emotion Embedder.

We define clustering strength 𝑑𝑐𝑙𝑠 =\nas\nthe ratio between inter-cluster distance 𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 and intra-cluster dis-\ntance 𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎.

The results show that visual information plays crucial role in the extraction of emotion prior, while audio features can serve as an auxiliary to enhance the clustering strength of emotion prior. However, using only audio features is insufficient to obtain effective emotions. When training the diffusion model in Sec. 3.3, if we do not employ an emotion prior sampling from Gaussian distribution in Eq. 6 and instead use deterministic mean 𝜇𝑠 for training, it may lead to overfitting of the training results and lost identity information. Figure 4(b) shows the results of different emotion prior acquisition methods. Using deterministic prior causes the model to transfer (eye reflections/facial contours) from the emotion reference video to the new face, leading to issues with identity deviation. The results in Table 4 confirm this. By employing the disentangled emotion embedder, the emotion prior obtained by the model from the same training video varies each time, thereby preventing the transfer of incorrect content to the generated video. What Can We Learn from Emotion Prior? We use t-SNE [30] to project the emotion priors into two-dimensional space. Figure 4(c) shows the emotion priors of two speakers from the MEAD dataset. Each prior is color-coded according to its corresponding emotion and intensity. The emotion priors with the same emotion first cluster together. Within each cluster, the emotion priors with the same intensity are closer to each other and there are noticeable transitions between emotion priors of different intensities. These observations indicate that our model can learn continuous distribution of emotion embedding. As shown in Figure 4(d), when performing linear interpolation between two emotion embeddings extracted from the test set, the facial expressions and details in the generated video transition smoothly."
