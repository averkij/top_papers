            "content": "Gradient-based learning in multi-player and adversarial settings is ubiquitous, from stylized adversarial training problems and latent-space games to multi-agent reinforcement learning and economic models. The resulting dynamics are typically driven by the pseudo-gradient of the players objectives, and one would like both the continuous-time flow and simple discrete-time schemes to converge robustly to Nash equilibrium. Classical convergence results assume that the pseudo-gradient operator is (strongly) monotone in Euclidean geometry [5, 22], an assumption violated even by simple two-player quadratic games with convex per-player objectives and strong couplings, where simultaneous gradient descent oscillates or diverges. This work takes structural, geometry-design viewpoint rather than proposing new game algorithm. We ask, for which differentiable games can we design block-diagonal metric in which standard gradient-based dynamics are contracting, and hence converge at quantified rate to Nash equilibrium on certified region? Our starting point is block-diagonal metric = diag(Pi), where each block Pi 0 weights player is variables, together with positive weight vector RN ++ that rescales players relative to each other. The resulting geometry is encoded by (w) := diag(wiPi), and we say that the game is contracting with margin α > 0 if the pseudo-gradient operator is α-strongly monotone in the (w)-inner product, or equivalently if the continuous flow = (x) is α-contracting in (w). 1 We introduce structural condition, Small-Gain Nash (SGN), that uses player-wise curvature and cross-player coupling bounds to certify such contraction in block metrics. Once metric and SGN margin α > 0 have been certified on region where these bounds hold, we show that the pseudo-gradient flow and simple explicit schemes (projected Euler and classical RK4) are contracting in this geometry under explicit step-size bounds expressed in terms of α and Lipschitz constant β of := . The pair (α, β) plays the role of game-theoretic CFL number that translates directly into safe step sizes on the certified region. Throughout, all structural bounds are stated on closed convex regions where curvature, coupling, and Lipschitz conditions hold (often compact forward-invariant sets). These are the certified regions on which our global statements should be understood. Contributions. At high level, we do not propose new game algorithm; instead, we design geometry in which existing gradient-based dynamics become contracting. Our main contributions are: We introduce the Small-Gain Nash (SGN) condition, block-diagonal small-gain inequality in weighted block metric that, via the matrix inequality C(w, α) 0, converts curvature and coupling bounds into strong monotonicity of the pseudo-gradient, extending Rosens diagonal concavity and classical small-gain theory to general block metrics. We show that SGN yields existence and uniqueness of variational-inequality/Nash solution on certified regions and exponential contraction of pseudo-gradient flow in the SGN metric, so that the continuous-time game dynamics are globally well-posed and convergent within this designed geometry. We show that SGN induces finite timescale band in the space of player weights w: as long as the geometric ratio = w2/w1 lies in this band, the scalar-step pseudo-gradient dynamics is contractive in the SGN metric. In contrast to TTUR, which stabilizes by sending the step-size ratio to infinity and often imposing large timescale separation, SGN can certify that no TTUR-style slowdown is needed for class of games that look unstable in Euclidean geometry. We develop an offline metric-and-timescale certification pipeline that, on compact region, estimates curvature, couplings, and Lipschitz constants from Hessian/Jacobian probes, optimizes over weights to obtain certificate (α, β, (w)), and validates the framework on non-monotone quadratic games and tabular Markov game, via mirror/Fisher and Markov-game extensions."

This is the best strong monotonicity margin obtainable within this diagonal SGN family; in general, non-block metrics could yield larger margins, but we restrict to this structured class for tractability. On region where the block bounds (1) hold, the SGN matrix C(w, α) encodes block small-gain inequality: C(w, α) 0 is equivalent to strong monotonicity of with margin α in the metric (w) by Theorem 3.2. The normalized gain matrix H(w) and Gershgorin condition of Section A.1 provide conservative but easy-to-check sufficient condition for C(w, α) 0 that depends only on (µ, L) and the weight ratios wi/wj. Remark 3.1 (Sufficiency and conservatism of SGN). The SGN condition is sufficient, not necessary, certificate of stability. Even when the pseudo-gradient is strongly monotone (or the flow is contracting) in some SPD metric, there need not exist weight vector such that the block-diagonal SGN matrix C(w, α) is positive definite. In such cases, more general Jacobian-based directional stability / DSC conditions can certify larger regions or larger margins than SGN. We briefly develop this refinement and its relation to SGN in Section A.3. The appeal of SGN is that it trades metric expressivity for tractability: it reduces the certificate to coarse block summaries (µi, Lij) and structured block-diagonal metric (w), avoiding the need to work with the full Jacobian spectrum while incurring some conservatism. In particular, any margin α certified by SGN guarantees that the DSC condition (16) holds in the same metric with at least margin α (see Section A.3); DSC can then refine this lower bound locally, while SGN provides tractable, block-structured way to obtain computable certificate in the first place."

Remark 5.1 (Finite vs. asymptotic timescales and TTUR). The two-player timescale band has natural connection to two-timescale update rules (TTUR) for stochastic approximation, such as the TTUR analysis of GAN training [10]. Classical TTUR results guarantee convergence by sending the timescale ratio rk = η2,k/η1,k , corresponding to infinite timescale separation between the slow and fast players. Our two-player SGN band instead identifies finite range of geometric ratios = w2/w1 for which the existing scalar-step dynamics is contractive in the SGN metric. In this sense SGN provides non-asymptotic complement to TTUR: it does not alter the update rule, but it certifies when finite timescale ratio suffices, giving license to speed in games that Euclidean analysis would incorrectly classify as unstable. Operationally, the SGN band for = w2/w1 identifies the range of metric weights under which the scalar-step pseudo-gradient flow is contractive. Remark 5.2 (High-dimensional timescale cones). In the = 2 case, the SGN condition reduces to scalar interval for = w2/w1. For > 2, the linearity of C(w, α) in implies that the set of valid weights = {w RN ++ : C(w, α) 0} forms convex cone in the positive orthant. While this does not admit simple 1D interval representation, it geometrically generalizes the band concept: the safe timescales form connected convex region where player update rates are balanced relative to the aggregate coupling structure. Operationally, identifying this cone (or optimizing the margin within it) remains efficient as Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEVP). Consider now the quadratic example f1(x1, x2) = µ1 2 1 + x1x2, f2(x1, x2) = µ2 2 x2 2 + x1x2, so the pseudo-gradient is (x) = (cid:20)µ1x1 + ax2 µ2x2 + bx1 (cid:21) , = = (cid:20)µ1 (cid:21) . µ2 In Euclidean geometry, is monotone iff the symmetric part Js = (J + )/2 Euclidean non-monotonicity. is positive semidefinite, i.e., µ1µ2 ((a + b)/2)2.

Positive definiteness is equivalent to wi(µi α) > 0 and 4w1w2(µ1 α)(µ2 α) (w1L12 + w2L21)2 > 0. Choosing weights that balance the off-diagonal terms, e.g. w1/w2 = L21/L12 = 0.05/10 = 1/200, so = w2/w1 = 200, gives w1L12 = w2L21 and simplifies the determinant condition to (µ1 α)(µ2 α) > L12L21. For the numerical values above, this reduces to (1 α)2 > 0.5, so any α (0, 1 0.5) is admissible; thus SGN holds with positive margin for the balanced weights. In the corresponding (w)-geometry, the vector field is less skewed and trajectories straighten, revealing regime where SGN holds and contraction can be certified. This illustrates how SGN leverages weighted geometry to compensate for strong cross couplings; Figs. 1 and 2 visualize the resulting flow and pseudospectra in Euclidean vs SGN geometries. 8 Figure 1: The Escape vs. Trap visualization of the quadratic example. Both panels display the same standard gradient flow trajectory (red). Left: In the Euclidean view, the trajectory transiently escapes the unit circle (dashed blue) outwards, indicating failure of monotonicity ( dt x2 > 0). Right: In the SGN-metric view (displayed as an ellipse in the original coordinates), the same trajectory strictly enters the sublevel set, visually confirming the contraction certificate provided by the weighted metric.

For example, in Euclidean geometry one has β J2 JF = (cid:112)µ2 2 + a2 + b2 10.1. Given certified monotonicity or DSC margin α > 0 in metric (w) (e.g., on region where the SGN condition holds), the RK4 policy of Theorem 4.3 yields concrete safe step C4/β. Within this step range, the one-step map is contraction in (w), providing priori stability guarantee with per-step factor exp(c4αh). Numerically, for the balanced SGN metric and step satisfying this bound, RK4 converges linearly to the origin, whereas using the same step in the Euclidean geometry leads to large oscillations or divergence, mirroring the qualitative behavior in Fig. 1. 1 + µ"

Setup. We consider discounted two-player Markov game [21] with state space = {s0, s1}, binary actions Ai = {0, 1}, and discount factor γ = 0.9. At each state s, both players receive cooperative reward that is +1 when they coordinate (00 or 11) and 1 on mismatches; the transition kernel encourages staying in the current state under consistent coordination and flips the state under the opposite coordinated action or mismatches. We choose minimal tabular setting to allow exact visualization of the Fisher-SGN geometry, which would be obscured in high-dimensional approximations. Each player uses tabular softmax policy πi( s) and an entropy-regularized objective Ji(π) = Eπ (cid:104) (cid:88) t=0 (cid:105) γtr(st, at) + τ (cid:88) sS H(cid:0)πi( s)(cid:1), fi = Ji, with negative entropy and regularization strength τ = 1. The mirror map is therefore the negative entropy on 2 2 and the associated local metric is the Fisher information matrix of the softmax parametrization, matching the mirror-SGN construction of Appendix B; we denote the player-wise Fisher blocks by Fi(θ). In 13 these Fisher coordinates the pseudo-gradient (θ) = (θ1 f1, θ2 f2) is well-defined, and the natural policy gradient update θk+1 = θk η Fi(θk)1 θifi(θk) is the standard natural policy gradient update (with scalar step size η), which we analyze using the weighted Fisher metric (w) = diag(cid:0)w1F1(θ), w2F2(θ)(cid:1) to certify contraction. Local mirror-SGN certificate. At the unique interior Nash equilibrium θ = 0 (uniform policies), we certify small neighbourhood in logit space by gridding cube {θ : θ θ 0.1} and evaluating the Fisher-normalized curvature, couplings, and Jacobian at each grid point (using the sampling-based SGN pipeline of Appendix A). For every grid point θ we form the own and cross Hessian blocks of fi and rescale them as in Appendix to obtain local (µi(θ), Lij(θ)). Taking the minimum and maximum over this grid yields conservative 21 0.60 for the mirror geometry around θ, so the mirror-SGN block bounds µlo two-player matrix H(w) admits positive margin for nontrivial range of weight ratios = w2/w1. Optimizing over with these bounds gives best diagonal margin α(w) 0.33 at near-balanced ratio 0.98. Using the same Fisher metric and grid we then bound the Jacobian log-norm of the natural-gradient field in the metric (w), obtaining local Lipschitz bound β 1.57. By the mirror-SGN contraction theorem (Appendix B) and the discrete-time Euler bound of Theorem 4.2, any step size 2 0.93 and Lhi 12 Lhi 1 µlo 0 < η < ηSGN := 2α(w) β2 0. ensures that the mirror Lyapunov function (θ) = (cid:80) xi(θ)) contracts along the natural policy gradient iterates in neighbourhood of θ at rate predicted by the factor (cid:112)1 2αη + β2η2. In particular, in this tabular Markov game, NPG enjoys certified local linear convergence guarantee to the interior Nash equilibrium, with contraction rate and admissible step-size band determined explicitly by (α(w), β) and the Fisher-SGN metric (w). wiDψi(x Natural vs Euclidean policy gradient. We instantiate the certified dynamics at conservative step η = 0.5 ηSGN and compare: (i) natural policy gradient (NPG) in the Fisher metric (w), and (ii) Euclidean policy gradient (EPG) on the logit parameters with the same scalar step size η. For each method we initialize policies near uniform and track the mirror Lyapunov Vk and the ℓ2 distance to θ. As shown in Fig. 6, NPG exhibits clean exponential decay of log Vk at rate substantially faster than EPG, and the empirical slope lies safely below the SGN upper bound implied by (α, β); EPG also converges in this benign setting, but with significantly slower decay and no comparable stepsize certificate. The right panel of Fig. 6 sweeps the NPG and EPG step sizes over multiples of ηSGN and shows that NPG is empirically stable (convergent across seeds) for η/ηSGN 1, with increasingly frequent failures beyond the SGN line, while EPG has different and method-dependent stability profile. This matches the intended role of SGN as sufficient design-time bound for NPG rather than sharp, method-independent phase transition. 14 Figure 6: Mirror Lyapunov decay and stability for natural (blue) vs Euclidean (red) policy gradient in the tabular Markov game.

Right: convergence probability (fraction of seeds classified as convergenteither triggering the small-gradient stopping criterion or ending with θk θ2 < 1.0 after 500 steps) as function of the step-size multiplier η/ηSGN, showing that NPG remains stable up to roughly the SGN bound while EPG has different stability profile. Markov timescale band. Finally, we examine the effect of relative player timescales by varying the weight ratio = w2/w1 in the Fisher metric while keeping the game and regularization fixed. Using the same locally estimated (µi, Lij) we compute the mirror-SGN margin α(r) from the 2 2 matrix H(w) and obtain nontrivial band of ratios where α(r) > 0; Fig. 7 plots this band. The band has the same qualitative shape as in the LQ game  (Fig. 4)  : extreme timescale imbalances violate the small-gain inequalities, while moderate interval of ratios admits diagonal mirror metric that certifies local contraction. This Markov example therefore confirms that the SGN timescale intuition and metric-design perspective extend beyond static quadratic games to entropy-regularized policy gradients in tabular Markov games.

This Fisher-Bellman small-gain viewpoint would rigorously decouple policy entropy (curvature) from the value-function scale and discount horizon (coupling), potentially yielding sharper stability conditions for actor-critic methods than those obtained by treating the Bellman operator as generic Lipschitz disturbance. Pursuing this model could lead to small-gain conditions that explicitly balance entropy-induced curvature against reward scale and discount horizon; we leave full development of such Fisher-Bellman SGN models to future work. Beyond existence of suitable metric, one can treat SGN as metric design problem: optimize over diagonal or block metrics to improve contraction margin relative to Lipschitz or log-norm bound (e.g., by minimizing matrix measure of JG or condition proxy such as β/α), and embed this into an IQC/dissipativity framework [3, 14, 16] that co-designs both geometry and algorithm parameters, potentially via vector-dissipativity viewpoints where each player contributes its own Lyapunov component. Finally, systematic empirical evaluation remains important: implementing the certification pipeline on structured quadratic, Markov, and moderately sized differentiable games; comparing certified step sizes and rates with empirically stable regimes; and studying how the cost and conservatism of SGN certificates scale with dimension and number of players. Such studies would indicate which game classes are most amenable to SGN-based certification and where additional structural assumptions or approximations are needed."

            "content": "Convergence of gradient-based dynamics to Nash equilibria under monotonicity conditions has long history, starting with Rosens diagonal strict concavity [22] and the variational inequality framework [5]. Rosens condition can be interpreted as the existence of positive diagonal scaling that renders the symmetric part of the pseudo-gradient positive definite; in matrix terms, this is closely related to diagonal stability conditions of the form DJ + 0 for some 0 [3, see, e.g., diagonal stability surveys in control and network theory]. Our SGN condition is block-diagonal, small-gain refinement of these ideas: instead of arbitrary scalings we work with coarse block summaries (µ, L) and structured weight vector w, and we phrase the diagonal dominance condition in terms of the small-gain matrix C(w, α), which plays the role of block Gershgorin/diagonal-stability certificate for the pseudo-gradient in the metric (w). Small-gain theorems originate in robust and nonlinear control [12, 25] and provide interconnection stability under gain composition conditions. The normalized gain matrix H(w) and the SGN matrix C(w, α) can be viewed as input-output gain composition inequalities for the players subsystems, with µi and Lij acting as selfand cross-gains; the SGN feasibility region is then directly analogous to classical small-gain inequalities phrased in terms of spectral radii or diagonal scalings. Passivity-based methods in games [6, 14] yield convergence under energy dissipation conditions, while potential games [18] admit convergence via scalar potential descent. More recent notions such as variational stability and coherence [17] relax monotonicity via curvature or averaging assumptions. Our work complements these by providing block-structured sufficient condition, expressed in terms of curvature and Lipschitz bounds, together with an explicit metric-design viewpoint that selects block-diagonal geometry to recover strong monotonicity on certified region. On the contraction side, our DSC condition is constant-metric instance of the general contraction-metric framework in nonlinear control and dynamical systems, where one searches for (possibly state-dependent) Riemannian metric (x) that renders flow contractive in differential coordinates [7, 15]. In full generality the contraction inequality must account for the Levi-Civita connection and the Lie derivative of (x), whereas SGN deliberately restricts attention to constant, block-diagonal metrics (w) and expresses contractivity via algebraic small-gain inequalities in terms of block curvature and coupling parameters (µi, Lij). On regions where SGN holds, the resulting metric (w) induces simple quadratic (or Bregman, in the mirror case) Lyapunov function, so the condition can be read as identifying class of games that are provably contractive together with their explicit Lyapunov certificates. 16 On the time-discretization side, explicit integrators for contractive systems have been extensively studied in numerical analysis [4, 9, 23, 24]. We build directly on this literature: the log-norm/matrix-measure bounds and stability regions for explicit Euler and RK methods in general norms are classical, and our contribution is to instantiate these results in the SGN metric and to translate them into concrete step-size policies for projected Euler and RK4 in the geometries induced by (w) and its mirror variants. Algorithms such as Extragradient [13] and OGDA [17, 20] improve convergence in monotone and certain nonmonotone settings. SGN is complementary to these methods: it provides structural condition and geometry in which both simple methods (Euler, RK) and more sophisticated ones (EG, OGDA) can be analyzed, and could in principle be combined with them by applying SGN-based metric design to their underlying pseudo-gradient operators."

The framework extends to local mirror/Fisher geometry on simpliceswhere Bregman Lyapunov functions and mirror flow/discretization contraction guarantees can be obtainedand we have outlined how the same small-gain ideas can be employed in closed-loop Markov games. We also described certification pipeline that, on compact regions, turns the structural SGN condition into formal and computable convergence certificate. Our viewpoint is closer to control and numerical analysis than to benchmark optimization: the goal is not new training algorithm, but framework for certifying that existing dynamics will converge in given game.

Additional Details on Verifying Small-Gain We briefly describe how the bounds (µlo, Lhi, βhi) in the certification pipeline can be obtained in practice on compact region R, and collect proofs of the core continuousand discrete-time contraction statements used in the main text. 18 If the fi are given by structured expressions (e.g., quadratic forms, compositions Tier 1: analytic bounds. of layers with known spectral bounds), one can propagate bounds on Hessian blocks and Jacobian norms across the computational graph using standard rules: positive semidefinite lower bounds for own-player Hessians and operator-norm upper bounds for cross-player blocks. This yields conservative but inexpensive estimates of µlo and Lhi ij , as well as bound βhi on JG(x)M (w)M (w) over R. Tier 2: refinement via sampling. To reduce conservatism, one can sample on finite cover (e.g., low-discrepancy design or grid in low dimension) and, at each S, perform: power iteration on block Jacobians to estimate Jij(s)PjPi over samples; for each (i, j), updating Lhi ij to the maximum Lanczos iterations on 2 minimum over samples; xixi fi(s) to estimate the smallest eigenvalue in the Pi-metric, updating µlo to the power iteration on JG(s) in the (w)-metric to refine βhi. If the Hessian and Jacobian vary Lipschitzly on R, these sample-wise estimates can be inflated by Lipschitz bounds and the cover radius to yield global bounds on in the (w)-geometry. In our experiments we use the sampling-based estimates directly without interval inflation, so the resulting certificates are numerically validated but not worst-case rigorous in the strict sense. From bounds to SGN and steps. Given (µlo, Lhi, βhi) on R, one then searches for weights RN ++ and margin α > 0 such that C(w, α) 0 with entries defined by (2), using, e.g., line search over α and an eigenvalue check for positive definiteness. Any such (w, α) yields certified SGN margin and metric (w) on R. When Jacobian information is available, one can optionally refine the margin by estimating directional/DSC constant αdsc α from the (w)-symmetric Jacobian SM (w)(x) via the condition (16) and replace α by max{α, αdsc}. By Theorems A.3, 3.2, 4.2 and 4.3 and standard results on strongly monotone flows, any resulting α and βhi produce explicit step-size ranges for projected Euler and RK4 that guarantee contraction on R. A.1 Gershgorin-style sufficient conditions for SGN The matrix condition C(w, α) 0 is the exact SGN certificate. Here we record conservative but easy-to-check alternative that depends only on curvature, couplings, and the weight ratios wi/wj. This condition implies SGN (and hence strong monotonicity) but need not be necessary. On region where the block bounds (1) hold, introduce the nonnegative scalars ai := wi xi yiPi , = 1, . . . , N, and coefficients kij := Lij (cid:114) wi wj (i = j). Define symmetric matrix H(w) RN by Hii(w) := µi, Hij(w) := 1 2 (cid:0)kij + kji (cid:1) (i = j). Combining the block bounds with these definitions yields the quadratic inequality y, (x) (y)M (w) aH(w) for all x, R. If H(w) αI for some α > 0, then aH(w)a α 2 for all a. Moreover, a2 2 = (cid:88) wi xi yi2 Pi = y2 (w) . 19 (8) (9) Thus from (9) we obtain the strong monotonicity inequality y, (x) (y)M (w) α y2 (w) x, R. (10) In particular, is α-strongly monotone in the metric (w), and the conclusions of Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 and the exponential convergence of the pseudo-gradient flow hold with this margin. One convenient way to certify H(w) αI is via strict diagonal dominance with margin. This yields the following constructive sufficient condition. Theorem A.1 (Gershgorin-type sufficient condition). Let µmin := mini µi. Suppose there exist weights wi > 0 and number α (0, µmin) such that, for every i, µi α > 1 2 (cid:88) (cid:16)"

By construction (8), all off-diagonal entries of H(w) are nonpositive. Condition (11) states that the diagonal entries of H(w) αI are strictly larger than the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries in the corresponding rows. By Gershgorins circle theorem, all eigenvalues of H(w) αI are strictly positive, so H(w) αI. Substituting this into (9) and using a2 (w) yields (10), and the final claim follows from the discussion in Section A.1. 2 = y2 The condition (11) depends on only through the ratios wi/wj. In the simplest case wi 1 one obtains Rosen-type Euclidean sufficient condition. Optimizing over allows one to reduce the right-hand side of (11) and enlarge the admissible margin α. It is often convenient to express (11) in terms of normalized gain matrix. For example, fixing reference weights wi > 0 and defining Kij := Lij µi , Kii := 0, classical small-gain and diagonal-scaling arguments (see, e.g., [3, 12, 25]) imply that the spectral radius ρ(K) controls the existence of diagonal scalings that satisfy inequalities of the form (11). If ρ(K) < 1, then there exists positive vector and constant λ (0, 1) such that (cid:88) j=i Kijvj λvi, = 1, . . . , N, and any such can be converted into choice of weights guaranteeing (11) with margin α proportional to (1 λ). The Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of corresponds to the least conservative such scaling. We do not pursue full spectral characterization here and instead use (11) as practical sufficient condition that can be evaluated in O(N 2) time independently of the parameter dimension. A.2 Two-player SGN band We record here closed-form characterization of the two-player timescale band used in the main text. Consider two players with curvature parameters µ1, µ2 > 0 and cross-Lipschitz constants L12, L21 0. For any weights w1, w2 > 0 and any margin α R, the SGN matrix specializes to C(w, α) = (cid:20) 2w1(µ1 α) (w1L12 + w2L21) (cid:21) (w1L12 + w2L21) 2w2(µ2 α) . Positive definiteness C(w, α) 0 is equivalent to C11 > 0, C22 > 0, and det > 0. The diagonal conditions simply require µ1 > α, µ2 > α, and do not constrain the ratio w2/w1 as long as wi > 0. The nontrivial constraint comes from the determinant: det C(w, α) = 4w1w2(µ1 α)(µ2 α) (w1L12 + w2L21)2 > 0."

Real roots exist if and only if (µ1 α)(µ2 α) > L12L21, (12) (13) which is the two-player analogue of Rosens diagonal strict concavity condition (in the symmetric case L12 = L21). When (13) holds, solving this quadratic yields two real roots r(α) := 2(µ1 α)(µ2 α) L12L21 2 (cid:113) (µ1 α)(µ2 α)(cid:0)(µ1 α)(µ2 α) L12L21 (cid:1) L2 21 , (14) and, since the leading coefficient is negative, the quadratic is positive on the open interval (r(α), r+(α)) and negative outside it. Consequently, the determinant condition is satisfied if and only if Proposition A.2 (Two-player SGN timescale band). Fix α < min{µ1, µ2} and assume (13) holds. Then for any weights w1, w2 > 0 the SGN matrix C(w, α) is positive definite if and only if the ratio r(α) < < r+(α). (15) = w2 w1 lies strictly between the two roots r(α) and r+(α) defined in (14). In particular, the set Wα := (cid:8)(w1, w2) R2 ++ : r(α) < w2/w1 < r+(α)(cid:9) is exactly the set of weight pairs for which SGN(µ, L; P, w) holds with margin α. The weight ratio therefore parameterizes safe timescale band for the two players in the SGN geometry. Proof. The diagonal conditions C11 > 0 and C22 > 0 are equivalent to µi > α and do not restrict r. The determinant condition det C(w, α) > 0 is equivalent to the quadratic inequality (12) in r. Under (13), this quadratic has two distinct real roots given by (14); since the leading coefficient is negative, the quadratic is positive exactly when (r(α), r+(α)), which yields (15) and the description of Wα. For α = 0, condition (13) reduces to µ1µ2 > L12L21 and the band (14) simplifies to r(0) = 2µ1µ2 L12L21 2(cid:112)µ1µ2(µ1µ2 L12L21) L2 21 , which is simple closed-form expression for safe timescale ratio band.

Thus (4) is equivalent to a(cid:0)C(w, 0) 2α diag(wi)(cid:1)a 0 RN . By definition, C(w, α) = C(w, 0) 2α diag(wi).

By Theorem 3.2, the pseudo-gradient is α-strongly monotone in the inner product induced by (w). Since (w) 0, this is equivalent, under the change of variables = (w)1/2x, to α-strong monotonicity of the transformed operator ˆF (z) := (w)1/2F (M (w)1/2z) in the Euclidean inner product on ˆX := (w)1/2X . Existence and uniqueness of the solution of VI( ˆF , ˆX ) therefore follow directly from standard monotone VI theory [5, Theorem 2.3.3], and the equivalence of VI( ˆF , ˆX ) and VI(F, ) under this linear change of variables yields unique solution to VI(F, ). When each Xi is convex and fi(, xi) is convex for all i, solutions of VI(F, ) coincide with Nash equilibria on product convex sets [5, Section 1.4], so the Nash equilibrium is unique. Directional stability and logarithmic norms. For an SPD metric 0 and Jacobian JG(x) of = , define the -symmetric part SM (x) := 1 (cid:0)M JG(x) + JG(x)M (cid:1). We say the system is diagonally stable in on set with margin α > 0 if the DSC condition used in the main text. The associated logarithmic norm (matrix measure) induced by is SM (x) α for all R, (16) µM (A) := sup zM =1 z, AzM = sup zM =1 1 2 (cid:0)M + AM (cid:1)z, so (16) is equivalent to µM (JG(x)) α for all R, the standard non-Euclidean contractivity condition used in log-norm analyses of ODE integrators [4, 9, 23]. Theorem A.3 (Directional/DSC refinement implies contraction). Suppose (16) holds on convex set R. Then for all x, R, y, G(x) G(y)M α y2 Consequently, the continuous flow = G(x) is α-contracting in on R. If, in addition, is β-Lipschitz in on R, then the discrete-time contraction results of Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 apply on with this directional margin α in place of the SGN margin. . 22 Proof of Theorem A.3. Along the segment xt := + t(x y) we have G(x) G(y) = (cid:82) 0 JG(xt) (x y) dt, so y, G(x) G(y)M = (cid:90) 1 0 (x y)SM (xt) (x y) dt α y2 , using (16). Contraction of the flow with rate α in is standard from matrix-measure arguments, and the discrete-time statements follow by repeating the proofs of Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 with the one-sided inequality above in place of strong monotonicity of . Remark A.1 (Contraction metrics and Riemannian view). The DSC condition (16) can be interpreted as constant-metric instance of Riemannian contraction: plays the role of (state-independent) Riemannian metric tensor and the inequality SM (x) αM ensures exponential decay of differential displacements in this metric along the flow [see, e.g., 7, 15]. More general contraction-metric frameworks allow state-dependent metrics (x), in which case the contraction inequality acquires additional terms involving the Levi-Civita connection and the Lie derivative of (x); by restricting to constant, block-diagonal metrics (w), SGN avoids these geometric terms and reduces the contraction condition to the algebraic Jacobian inequality (16). SGN implies DSC. On region where the block bounds (1) hold and the weighted SGN condition of Theorem 3.1 is satisfied with margin α > 0, Theorem 3.2 implies , (x + ) (x)M (w) α 2 (w) x, . Letting = and using the differentiability of to differentiate this inequality at = 0 shows that , JG(x) (w) α 2 (w) for all and all in the region. By polarization, this is equivalent to SM (w)(x) αM (w), i.e., (16) with = (w). Thus SGN produces diagonally stable metric and guarantees at least the margin α; Jacobian-based estimation of SM (w)(x) can only certify directional margin from (16) that matches or exceeds this SGN margin, so the SGN margin acts as lower bound. Mirror Geometry and Small-Gain Nash Mirror/Fisher variants of our results use standard notions of mirror maps and Bregman divergences on the players strategy spaces (for example, negative entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence on simplices). We sketch how the mirror-geometry ingredients underlying Theorem B.3 can be derived from Hessian bounds and transported to the Lyapunov analysis for mirror flows and mirror discretizations. Throughout, we work on compact region contained in the interior of the players domains where the Hessians of fi and ψi are uniformly bounded and invertible. Rather than imposing symmetric block bounds for all pairs (x, y) as in Theorem 2.1, it is convenient in mirror geometry to work with inequalities relative to fixed equilibrium x. We orient the Bregman divergences as Dψi (x xi) so that they can be used directly as components of Lyapunov function measuring distance from to x. Definition B.1 (Mirror block bounds around x). Let be Nash equilibrium and let (ψi)i be mirror maps. We say that the pseudo-gradient obeys mirror block bounds (µ, L) around on region if for all and each player i, (cid:10)xi i , xifi(x) xifi(x)(cid:11) µi Dψi(x xi) (cid:88) j=i Lij (cid:113) Dψi(x xi) (cid:113) Dψj (x xj). (17) Here µi > 0 and Lij 0 play the role of curvature and coupling parameters in the mirror geometry. Given mirror block bounds, we define normalized gain matrix using the Bregman distances to x. For weights RN ++ define ai(x) := (cid:113) wi Dψi(x xi), kij := Lij 23 (cid:114) wi wj , and let H(w) RN be the symmetric matrix with entries exactly as in Section A.1. We say that mirror-SGN(w, α) holds with margin α > 0 if H(w) αI. Hii(w) := µi, Hij(w) := 1 2 (cid:0)kij + kji (cid:1) (i = j), (18) Multiplying (17) by wi and summing over shows that (cid:10)x x, (x) (x)(cid:11) wiui, vi and a(x) = (ai(x))i. where u, vw := (cid:80) α (cid:80) wiDψi (x Lemma B.2 (Mirror strong monotonicity at x).

(19) Next we consider mirror analogue of the pseudo-gradient flow = (x). Introduce dual variables zi = ψi(xi) and let = (z1, . . . , zN ). The mirror pseudo-gradient flow is defined in dual coordinates by (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1) = xifi xi(t) = ψ zi(t) = Gi (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1), (zi(t)). (20) For negative entropy mirror maps on simplices this flow coincides with natural-gradient ODE whose trajectories remain in the interior of the product simplex [1, 2]. Define the Bregman Lyapunov function (x) := (cid:88) i=1 wi Dψi (x xi). Theorem B.3 (Mirror flow contraction under mirror SGN). Assume each ψi is Legendre mirror map on Xi and is an interior Nash equilibrium with (x) = 0 in the chosen coordinates (for example, after reparameterizing policies via logits so that the simplex constraint is implicit). Suppose mirror block bounds (17) hold on region containing and mirror-SGN(w, α) holds there for some RN ++ and α > 0. Let x(t) solve the mirror flow (20) with x(0) and assume x(t) for all 0. Then decays exponentially along the flow: (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1) α (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1), (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1) eαt (cid:0)x(0)(cid:1), dt and in particular x(t) as . Corollary B.4 (Mirror Euler and mirror RK contraction). Under the assumptions of Theorem B.3, suppose in addition that satisfies Lipschitz and log-norm bounds on analogous to those in Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 in the weighted inner product , w. Then there exist step-size ranges of the form 0 < η < 2α β2 , 0 < C4 β , for which mirror-Euler and mirror-RK4, respectively, are contractions with respect to the Bregman Lyapunov function : for some (0, 1) and all iterates that remain in R.

Then standard integration-along-segments argument analogous to Theorem 2.1 shows that the mirror block inequality (17) holds on with these (µi, Lij), with Bregman divergences Dψi(x xi) playing the role of squared distances. 24 B.2 Proof of mirror strong monotonicity Starting from (17), multiply by wi > 0 and sum over players to obtain wi (cid:10)xi , xifi(x) xifi(x)(cid:11) (cid:88) wiµiDψi(x xi) (cid:88) (cid:88) i=j (cid:113) wiLij Dψi(x xi) (cid:113) Dψj (x xj). Introducing ai(x) := (cid:112)wiDψi(x xi) and kij := Lij (cid:10)x x, (x) (x)(cid:11) (cid:112)wi/wj yields a(x)H(w) a(x), with H(w) as in (18). exactly (19). If H(w) αI, then a(x)H(w)a(x) αa(x)2 2 = α (cid:80) wiDψi(x xi), which is B.3 Lyapunov derivative for the mirror flow For Legendre mirror maps the change of variables zi = ψi(xi) is diffeomorphism between primal neighbourhood of and dual neighbourhood of ). Recall the mirror flow (20), := ψi(x with = . Using the representation zi(t) = Gi (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1), xi(t) = ψ (zi(t)), Dψi(x xi) = ψi(x ) ψi(xi) (cid:10)ψi(xi), xi (cid:11), and differentiating along trajectory x(t) shows that dt Dψi(x xi(t)) = (cid:10)Gi (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1), xi(t) (cid:11), where we have used zi = 2ψi(xi) xi and the Legendre property to cancel the ψi and zi, xi terms. Summing over players with weights wi yields dt (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1) = (cid:88) wi (cid:10)Gi(x(t)), xi(t) (cid:11) = (cid:10)x(t) x, G(x(t)) G(x)(cid:11) w, since G(x) = (x) = 0 at an interior Nash equilibrium. Combining this with the mirror strong-monotonicity inequality (19) and = gives which proves Theorem B.3. (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1) α (cid:0)x(t)(cid:1), dt B.4 Mirror Euler and mirror RK discretizations Finally, the contraction of mirror-Euler and mirror-RK4 schemes follows by transporting the Euclidean arguments of Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 to dual coordinates. In dual space the mirror flow is an ODE = G(ψ(z)) endowed with the weighted Euclidean inner product , w. The log-norm and Lipschitz bounds induced by mirror block bounds and mirror SGN yield one-sided inequalities for z, G(ψ(z)) G(ψ(z))w exactly as in the Euclidean case. Explicit Euler and RK4 applied to this dual ODE therefore satisfy the same contractivity estimates as in Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 for sufficiently small step sizes. Numerically, one integrates the unconstrained dual dynamics in Rd (for example, Fisher-natural logits on the simplex) using standard RK4 stages and maps back to the primal variables via = ψ(z) only for analysis or termination, so intermediate RK4 stages never hit the primal boundary and no projection on the simplex is required. When the dual domain itself is constrained, metric nonexpansiveness of the corresponding mirror projection ΠZ plays the role of Theorem 4.1 in the contraction argument."

All experiments use the balanced metric (wbal) with w1/w2 = b/a and the same coupling grid as in Fig. 3. Phase diagrams and flow norms. For each λ we compute the SGN Euler and RK4 step-size bounds and the true stability thresholds obtained from spectral radii of the one-step matrices. The resulting phase diagrams on the (λ, h)-plane are shown in Fig. 5. In both cases the SGN step-size curves lie strictly inside the true stability boundaries but remain within moderate factor of them, confirming that the SGN step-size policies are conservative but nontrivial. Figure 8 shows median norms x(t)M (wbal) along continuous-time flows for representative couplings, together with reference exponential curves at rates αtrue and α; the empirical decay closely tracks the true metric margin whenever SGN holds. Figure 8: Continuous-time flows for the canonical LQ game in the balanced metric. For three representative couplings we plot median norms x(t)M (wbal) over random initial conditions, together with reference exponentials at rates αtrue and α. The empirical decay is consistent with the certified metric margins. Structured noise robustness and random LQ ensemble. To probe robustness beyond the perfectly structured canonical game we perturb both coupling matrices by spectrally normalized Gaussian noise. For each noise level ϵ [0, 1] we compute the true metric margin and the SGN margin (based on spectral norms of the perturbed couplings) and report the average conservatism ratio αtrue/α in Fig. 9. At ϵ = 0 the ratio is close to 1, while for ϵ 1 SGN becomes more conservative but remains valid lower bound whenever it certifies. We also ran small random LQ ensemble, drawing heterogeneous quadratic games with the same (a, b) but random curvature and cross-player blocks, and evaluating Euclidean and SGN margins and RK4 step bounds at several couplings. With fixed balanced metric, SGN is intentionally conservative: whenever it certifies positive margin, the ratio α/αtrue typically lies between 0.15 and 1 over small and moderate couplings, and the logarithmic step-size ratio log10(hSGN/hstab) clusters just below zero. For larger couplings the true metric margin can remain positive while SGN in this fixed metric fails, indicating that metric redesign would be necessary; aggregate statistics and plots are reported in Fig. 10. Figure 9: Structured coupling noise robustness for the canonical LQ game. The curve shows the average conservatism ratio αtrue/α as function of the noise fraction ϵ. SGN remains tight in the structured case and becomes gradually more conservative as the couplings become unstructured. Figure 10: Random LQ ensemble: SGN vs true margins and RK4 step bounds. Left: scatter of α/αtrue per coupling, with medians and interquartile ranges. Middle: scatter of log10(hSGN/hstab).
