            "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs; Jiang et al. 2023; Gemma Team et al. 2024; Grattafiori et al. 2024) are increasingly able to follow complex user instructions and memorize internet-scale data. However, these advancements have also made it easier to access harmful or personally identifiable information that is present on the internet directly from their parametric memory. Because of these safety risks, substantial work has focused on aligning 1Code and data for reproducing our study are available here: https://github.com/McGill-NLP/malicious-ir. 2These documents are for illustrative purposes and contain deliberate inaccuracies. (b) RAG-based Approach Figure 1: Instruction-following retrievers can easily satisfy malicious requests. Top: Retrievers can select malicious content using fine-grained queries. Bottom: Retrieved malicious content can be fed to safety aligned LLM which can use the content to answer the request.2 LLMs with human values to ensure their safe use (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). Similar to LLMs, we are at pivotal moment with instructionfollowing retrievers (Asai et al., 2023; Su et al., 2023; Oh et al., 2024), where recent performance increases have also introduced new safety risks. While instruction-following retrievers top the leaderboards of retrieval benchmarks, such as MTEB (Muennighoff et al., 2023) and BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021), their capabilities can also be used for malicious purposes. These retrievers can be used for malicious information retrieval using either direct approach or by using retrieval-augmented generation-based (RAG) approach. With the direct approach, user instructs the retriever to fetch passages with certain targeted information (see Figure 1a). The instructionfollowing capability of these models can be further exploited by refining the query to select highly relevant passages. With the RAG-based approach, retrieved harmful passages are fed to an LLM, which is then used to answer targeted queries (see Figure 1b). In this paper, we demonstrate that current instruction-following retrievers can be exploited, using either approach, for malicious information retrieval. Concretely, in this paper we investigate whether six strong retrievers, including NV-Embed and LLM2Vec, can satisfy malicious information requests either directly (3.1), by leveraging their instruction-following ability (3.2), or by using RAG-based approach (3.3) where retrieved harmful passages are included in-context to generate final response. With respect to the direct approach, we find current retrievers exhibit worringly level capability for malicious retrievalfor instance, LLM2Vec and NV-Embed select correct passages for 61.35% and 59.04% of the malicious queries we evaluate, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the instruction-following capabilities of these retrievers can be easily exploited for finegrained passage selection. Finally, with respect to the RAG-based approach, we find safety-aligned LLMs, such as Llama3, can be made to satisfy malicious requests by including relevant passages in-context."

            "title": "2 Background",
            "content": "Existing work on retriever safety has focused largely on corpus poisoning attacks (Zhong et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2023; Su et al., 2024) where adversarial passages are added to retrieval corpora with undesirable qualities like misinformation. In poisoning attacks, malicious actor deliberately injects misinformation to mislead retrievers into fetching incorrect content for safe-looking queries (e.g., who is the CEO of Apple?), causing LLMs to generate incorrect answers (Xue et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024). recent Additionally, research on training instruction-following retrievers (Asai et al., 2023; Su et al., 2023; Oh et al., 2024; Weller et al., 2024), in conjunction with work on adapting decoder-only LLMs for retrieval (Li et al., 2025; BehnamGhader et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2025; Weller et al., 2025), has resulted in the development of retrievers with greater controllability. While prior research has highlighted safety risks with real-world retriever deployment, the growing sophistication of these models underscores the need to investigate their potential for direct malicious use. In this paper, we study the safety risks of retrievers handling malicious queries, where fulfilling the information need poses significant risks (Weidinger et al., 2022; Hendrycks et al., 2023), e.g., providing recipe for making homemade explosive device."

            "content": "We begin by investigating retriever malicious information retrieval performance. Below, we discuss our retrieval corpus, as well as the retrievers and benchmarks used in our study. Retrieval corpus. To evaluate whether retrievers can fetch harmful passages, we construct retrieval corpus consisting of harmful and benign passages. For the harmful passages, we use an unaligned LLM to generate passages corresponding to AdvBench queries (Zou et al., 2023). Concretely, we use Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 to generate passage for each of the 520 AdvBench queries.3 For the benign passages, we use Wikipedia passages (from an English Wikipedia dump from December 20, 2018). See Table 3 for sample passages and Figure 4 for additional data statistics in Appendix B. Retrievers. We experiment with six retrievers: DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020), Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022), LLM2Vec (BehnamGhader et al., 2024), NV-Embed (Lee et al., 2025), Promptriever (Weller et al., 2025), and BGE-en-icl (Li et al., 2025).

We evaluate whether retrievers can correctly select passages for malicious and benign queries from the retrieval corpus and report top-k accuracies (for = 1 or = 5). To assess harmful capability, we evaluate whether retrievers can select passages corresponding to the AdvBench queries. Henceforth, we refer to this set of malicious queries and passages as AdvBench-IR. To assess benign capability, we evaluate whether retrievers can select Wikipedia passages corresponding to TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) and NaturalQuestions (NQ; Kwiatkowski et al. 2019) queries.4 Malicious results. We present the performance of retrievers in selecting relevant passages for AdvBench-IR queries in Table 1. We find all retrievers correctly select relevant passages for many malicious queries (e.g., LLM2Vec selects the correct passage for 61.35% of queries). Moreover, we find all four LLM-based retrievers have top-5 accuracies over 78%. Furthermore, despite LLM2Vec and Promptriever being fine-tuned on top of LLMs which have been safety-trained, we observe this alignment transfers poorly to retrieval. We also analyze how frequently retrievers select harmful passages for malicious queries, irrespective of their relevance. For five of our retrievers, we find they retrieve malicious passages for over 90% of the queries. See Appendix for further details and harm category-based results on AdvBench-IR. Benign results. From the AdvBench-IR results alone, one might conclude that LLM-based retrievers are substantially less safe than DPR and Figure 2: Average passage rankings for fine-grained retrieval. Rank values can vary from zero to 100 (i.e., most to least similar). Contriever. To contextualize our findings, we provide results for two benign retrieval tasksNQ and TriviaQAin Table 1. We find BGE-en-icl performs best on NQ and TriviaQA, obtaining top-1 accuracies of 62.66% and 74.65%, respectively. Generally, we observe that performance on NQ and TriviaQA is strongly correlated with performance on AdvBench-IR. For instance, all four LLM-based retrievers outperform DPR and Contriever on both malicious and benign benchmarks."

For example, with ten in-context passages, 67.12% of Llama3-8B-Instructs responses are flagged harmful. These results show that with an unsafe retriever, even aligned LLMs can be made to comply with malicious requests."

            "content": "Below, we summarize our three key findings on the malicious misuse of retrievers, whether used directly, through their instruction-following ability, or within RAG-based setup. Retrievers can select relevant passages for malicious queries (3.1). We found that all six studied retrievers can select relevant passages for diverse range of malicious queries. Furthermore, despite two of our retrieversLLM2Vec and Promptrieverbeing fine-tuned on LLMs optimized for harmlessness, we observed little transfer of these safety capabilities to retrieval tasks. Retrievers will increasingly be able to search over the vast amount of harmful internet content and we hope our work highlights these emerging risks. Instruction-following retrievers can be exploited for fine-grained malicious information retrieval (3.2). We demonstrated that the greater controllability provided by recent instruction-following retrievers can be exploited to retrieve highly specific malicious content. Increasing retriever capability will enable harmful information to be easily retrieved from large text corpora via fine-grained queries. We believe developing retrievers which are unable to carry out such malicious requests, while maintaining benign retrieval capability, is an important area for future work. LLMs satify malicious requests with unsafe retrieval (3.3). We found that including harmful retrieved passages in-context increases the harmfulness of LLM responses, even for safety-aligned models, such as Llama3-8B-Instruct, showing that the LLMs can satisfy malicious information needs using RAG-based approach. We believe integratFigure 3: Response harmfulness () for AdvBench-IR queries with varying numbers of in-context retrieved passages. ple, for an AdvBench query about building homemade bomb, the passages each can describe construction processes which use different materials or tools. Then, for each query-passage pair, we use an LLM to generate fine-grained query based upon the passages characteristics, which can be used to identify the passage. For example, fine-grained query might request recipe for homemade explosive device using limited set of materials. We add these 500 passages to our retrieval corpus and investigate Promptrievers performance. For each of the 50 diverse AdvBench queries, we compute the rank of each of the ten generated passages for each fine-grained query (resulting in 10 10 matrix) and average these rankings across the 50 diverse queries. We provide example fine-grained queries and passages in Table 9 of Appendix D. Results. We present our results in Figure 2. We observe, evident by the rankings of the diagonal elements, that the fine-grained queries can be used by Promptriever to accurately identify corresponding passages. Concretely, we observe that fine-grained query-passage pairs obtain ranking of 2.09, on average. Our results demonstrate that instructionfollowing retrievers can be easily exploited for finegrained malicious information retrieval. See Figure 8 in Appendix for additional results."

            "title": "Limitations",
            "content": "Below, we describe two main limitations to our work. 1) Retrievers may be biased towards LLM generated passages. As collecting real-world harmful passages is difficult, we instead use LLM generated passages. Previous work has suggested that LLMs may be biased towards their own generated content (Panickssery et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024). Future work can use more realistic retrieval corpora for investigating safety risks surrounding retrievers. 2) We do not investigate how retrievers can be used for finding sensitive or personally identifiable information. In our work, we focused on evaluating whether retrievers can select relevant passages for malicious requests (e.g., making homemade bomb). However, instruction-following retrievers could also be used to select sensitive information, such as personal addresses or private information, from large text corpora. We believe investigating and mitigating such capabilities to be an important area for future work."

We provide the Hugging Face checkpoints for the models studied in our work in Table 2. AdvBench-IR Malicious Data Generation and Statistics In Figure 5, we provide the prompt used to generate malicious documents for AdvBench-IR. We use Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 to generate all the documents within the corpus. AdvBench-IR has 1796 passages obtained by splitting the 520 generated documents into chunks of at most 100 tokens. The generated documents are on average 294.68 tokens long. The chunks in the malicious corpus have an average length of 85.3 tokens. All of the documents are generated with maximum of 1024 tokens using temperature of 1.0 and top-p of 0.95. AdvBench-IR contains queries across five diverse harm categories introduced by Mazeika et al. (2024): Cybercrime & Unauthorized Intrusion, Chemical & Biological Weapons/Drugs, Misinformation & Disinformation, Harassment & Bullying, Illegal Activities. We present the distribution of the categories in AdvBench-IR in Figure 4. We provide example query-passage pairs for each harm category in Table 3."

We also provide results for each of the five AdvBench-IR harm categories in Table 4. Details of Using Instruction-Following Retrievers with Fine-Grained Queries To generate the ten malicious document and finegrained query pairs for the 50 diverse AdvBench queries (discussed in Section 3.2), we use temperature of 1.0 and top-p of 0.95. We generate these documents with maximum of 512 tokens using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The documents and finegrained queries are generated using the prompts provided in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively. In Table 9, we provide examples of documents generated for two different queries, and their corresponding fine-grained generated queries. In addition to the results presented in Section 3.2, Figure 8 highlights the impact of generated finegrained queries for the 24 AdvBench-IR queries related to bombs. The light diagonal colour of the fine-grained ranking demonstrates that with finegrained queries, the retriever is capable of distinguishing between the correct passage and the other relevant passages."
