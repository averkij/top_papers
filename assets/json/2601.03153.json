However, a persistent challenge in recommendation\nlies in the sparsity of user behavioral data, which fundamentally\nlimits traditional models’ capability to perform complex logical\ninference for uncovering users’ potential interest patterns and pref-\nerence dynamics [36, 38, 60]. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in\nlarge language models (LLMs) [5, 16, 30], where incorporating rea-\nsoning mechanisms has demonstrated remarkable improvements\nin challenging tasks such as mathematical problem-solving [2, 43]\nand code generation [9, 22], an emerging paradigm in sequential\nrecommendation has begun to embrace test-time computation strate-\ngies [63].

            "content": "Despite their promise, existing reasoning-enhanced recommendation methods encounter several critical limitations. For explicit reasoning approaches, two fundamental challenges persist: (1) Inference latency overhead: The generation of verbose reasoning chains incurs substantial computational costs, creating prohibitive delays for real-time online serving scenarios. (2) Reasoning chain definition ambiguity: Unlike mathematical reasoning or code synthesis tasks, where LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 [11], Qwen3 [55], and Kimi1.5 [40]) leverage extensive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data during post-training that can be rigorously verified against objective ground truth. However, recommendation scenarios lack welldefined reasoning trajectories. The absence of expert-annotated, high-quality correct reasoning chains makes it inherently challenging to guide explicit reasoning in recommendation contexts. In contrast, latent reasoning-enhanced recommendation methods adopt data-driven, annotation-free approach to unlock models reasoning potential. However, these methods face distinct bottleneck: current techniques mainly rely on depth computational scalingdeepening the reasoning process through recurrent autogressive steps. Empirical evidence suggests that further increases Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al. in reasoning depth yield diminishing or even negative performance gains [24, 35, 65]. We argue this limitation likely stems from two intertwined factors: (i) the models initial reasoning direction may be suboptimal, and (ii) error accumulation along extended reasoning chains progressively degrades the thinking quality, ultimately constraining the models reasoning capability ceiling. In this work, to meet the demands of real-time online inference, we adopt the latent reasoning paradigm while rethinking its computational approach. Rather than pursuing deeper reasoning along singular trajectory, we draw inspiration from cognitive science [6, 17], which reveals that humans typically explore multiple plausible solution paths concurrently before converging to comprehensive conclusion. Building upon this insight, we propose novel computational scaling dimension: width-level reasoning enhancement. Multi-stream latent reasoning enables the model to capture users dynamic and multifaceted interest preferences through diverse reasoning trajectories, preventing premature lockin to single, potentially suboptimal thought process. However, applying this idea is non-trivial due to the following challenges: Challenge 1: How to construct multi-stream reasoning? Unlike discrete decoding in LLMs, where techniques such as beam search [49, 51], self-consistency [1, 46], and majority voting [4, 45] operate on language token sequences, it remains unclear how to effectively construct multiple reasoning streams in the continuous latent representation space. Challenge 2: How to avoid reasoning homogeneity? While width scaling increases computational capacity, it is critical to prevent multiple streams from converging to similar reasoning patterns, leading to redundant resource consumption without bringing positive benefits. Challenge 3: How to aggregate different reasoning streams? After parallel exploration, the model needs to synthesize insights from multiple reasoning pathways into unified solution. Naive aggregation strategies (e.g., mean pooling) risk diluting the contributions of superior reasoning streams while amplifying the interference from inferior ones. To address these challenges, we propose simple yet effective framework for parallel latent reasoning in sequential recommendation, named Parallel Latent Reasoning (PLR). Specifically, to expand the latent representation from sequential encoder to multiple streams, we introduce learnable trigger tokens that actively guide the model to conduct parallel multi-stream reasoning. This simple design effectively resolves the challenge of stream construction in continuous latent space. Furthermore, to enhance the distinctiveness among different streams and across reasoning steps within each stream, we introduce global reasoning regularization mechanism that mitigates the homogeneity issue. For aggregating results from multiple parallel reasoning streams, we design an mixtureof-reasoning-streams aggregation module that adaptively weights and combines outputs from different streams to synthesize the final sequence representation. Additionally, to improve the models reasoning robustness, we propose reasoning contrastive learning objective that enhances the models ability to handle sparse user behaviors. We also provide in-depth theoretical analysis to explain the effectiveness of our approach, offering insights that advance the understanding of reasoning-enhanced recommendation. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We pioneer the exploration of width-level computational scaling for latent reasoning in sequential recommendation, enabling novel architecture that synergizes breadth and depth reasoning while maintaining real-time inference efficiency. We propose PLR, model-agnostic framework for parallel latent reasoning that employs learnable trigger tokens to construct diverse reasoning streams in continuous latent space, regularizes global reasoning patterns to preserve diversity, and aggregates multi-stream outputs through mixture-of-reasoning-streams. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PLR achieves substantial improvements and establishes new ceilings for sequential recommendation, opening new avenues for latent reasoning-enhanced recommendation research."

            "content": "Traditional recommendation methods rely on single forward pass to encode the sequence representation, where the fixed computational budget limits their modeling capability, particularly in sparse interaction scenarios. To enable more fine-grained reasoning and deeper representation learning, recent works have explored latent reasoning-enhanced recommender systems [8, 24, 35, 64], which shift from the conventional shallow input-output paradigm to multi-step input-think-output reasoning framework. Formally, given an input sequence S𝑢 , latent reasoning-enhanced model first encodes the sequence into latent representation h0 through an encoder 𝑓enc: h0 = 𝑓enc (S𝑢 ; 𝜃enc), where 𝜃enc denotes the encoder parameters. Subsequently, the model performs 𝑇 iterative reasoning steps to progressively refine the representation: h𝑡 = 𝑓rea (h𝑡 1; 𝜃rea), 𝑡 = 1, 2, . . . ,𝑇 , where 𝑓rea is the reasoning module with parameters 𝜃rea (which can be shared with or distinct from 𝜃enc depending on the specific method). Finally, the model generates the prediction based on the refined representation h𝑇 . The core principle of this paradigm is to enhance the models computational expressiveness through iterative reasoning, thereby improving accuracy on complex tasks.

Subsequently, X0 is fed into multi-layer multi-head self-attention module to capture complex dependencies among items in the sequence. Specifically, for the 𝑙-th layer, the computation is formulated as: X𝑙 = MultiHead(X𝑙 1) + X𝑙 1, where the multi-head self-attention operation is defined as: MultiHead(X) = Concat(head1, . . . , head𝐻 )W 𝑂, with each attention head computed as: Figure 1: Overall architecture of the Parallel Latent Reasoning framework. RPE denotes reasoning position embedding. However, empirical studies on existing latent reasoning-enhanced methods reveal critical limitation: after stacking multiple reasoning steps (e.g., 2 steps in ReaRec [35], 3-4 steps in LARES [24], and 1 step in LatentR3 [65]), models often exhibit marginal or even negative performance gains, phenomenon known as overthinking [29, 53]. This issue suggests that depth-only computational scaling may be insufficient to unlock the models full potential. More advanced reasoning mechanisms are needed to further unleash the latent reasoning capabilities of recommendation models."

After 𝐿 encoder layers, we obtain the final encoded representation Henc = X𝐿 R𝑛𝑑 . , W𝑉 3.1.2 Depth-Level Latent Reasoning. Following recent latent reasoning methods (e.g., ReaRec [35]), we extend the conventional one-pass encoding paradigm to incorporate depth-level multi-step reasoning computation. Rather than directly using the encoder output Henc as the final sequence representation, which is constrained by limited computational capacity for capturing fine-grained user interests, we introduce additional autoregressive reasoning steps to progressively refine the latent representation. Specifically, we extract the representation of the last item in the sequence as the initial reasoning state: h0 = Henc [1] R𝑑 . Then, the model performs 𝑇 iterative reasoning steps: h𝑡 = 𝑓 (h𝑡 1, r𝑡 ; 𝜃 ), 𝑡 = 1, 2, . . . ,𝑇 , (2) where 𝑓 denotes the reasoning module implemented as Transformer layers with shared parameters 𝜃 from the encoder, and r𝑡 R𝑑 is the Reasoning Position Embedding (RPE) for step 𝑡 that helps distinguish the reasoning phase from the encoding phase. 3.1.3 Width-Level Parallel Reasoning. However, depth-only computational scaling remains susceptible to several critical limitations: suboptimal initial reasoning directions and error accumulation across continuous reasoning chains. To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel dimension of computational scaling: width-level parallel latent reasoning. The key challenge lies in extending the continuous latent state vector into multiple parallel streams in the latent space. To enable this extension, we introduce learnable trigger tokens {𝝉1, 𝝉2, . . . , 𝝉𝑀 } R𝑑 to explicitly guide different reasoning streams, where 𝑀 denotes the number of parallel reasoning streams. Specifically, we adopt simplistic approach: we add each trigger token to the initial reasoning state h0 to obtain 𝑀 distinct beginning reasoning states, which is formulated as: h0,𝑚 = h0 + 𝝉𝑚, 𝑚 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑀. This design allows each stream to start from perturbed initial state, encouraging the exploration of diverse reasoning trajectories. (3) Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al. For the attention mechanism across multiple reasoning streams, we adopt stream-isolated causal reasoning approach with shared input attention. Formally, for each stream 𝑚 at reasoning step 𝑡, the computation is formulated as: h𝑡,𝑚 = Attention(Q𝑡,𝑚, K𝑡,𝑚, V𝑡,𝑚) + h𝑡 1,𝑚, (4) where: 𝑄, 𝐾, (5) Q𝑡,𝑚 = (h𝑡 1,𝑚 + r𝑡 )W K𝑡,𝑚 = [X0; h1,𝑚; . . . ; h𝑡 1,𝑚]W V𝑡,𝑚 = [X0; h1,𝑚; . . . ; h𝑡 1,𝑚]W here, [; ] denotes concatenation along the sequence dimension. This design ensures that: (i) each stream attends to the shared interaction context, preserving access to the original input information; (ii) reasoning within each stream follows causal pattern, where the state at step 𝑡 only attends to previous steps within the same stream; (iii) different streams remain isolated during reasoning, enabling independent exploration of diverse reasoning paths. 𝑉 , 1 , Hrea 2 , . . . , Hrea After 𝑇 reasoning steps, we obtain 𝑀 refined representation groups {Hrea 𝑀 }, where Hrea 𝑚 = {h1,𝑚, h2,𝑚, . . . , h𝑇 ,𝑚 } corresponds to the reasoning trajectory of the 𝑚-th stream. Following the Ensemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) strategy from ReaRec, we apply average pooling over the multi-step outputs within each reasoning stream to obtain the stream-specific representation: z𝑚 = 1 𝑇 𝑇 𝑡 =1 h𝑡,𝑚, 𝑚 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑀. (6) The final sequence representation is then derived by aggregating the outputs {z1, z2, . . . , z𝑀 } from all reasoning streams. In Section 3.2.3, we will introduce our adaptive mixture-of-reasoning-streams approach for combining multi-stream reasoning results."

            "content": "3.2.1 Global Reasoning Regularization. To prevent multiple reasoning streams from collapsing into homogeneous patterns, where different streams exhibit highly similar reasoning states, we introduce global reasoning regularization mechanism. Specifically, we enforce diversity constraints across all reasoning states (both within and across streams) through bidirectional Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization. Formally, let h𝑡,𝑚 denote the hidden state at step 𝑡 of stream 𝑚. We compute the distribution over the item vocabulary for each reasoning state as: 𝑝𝑡,𝑚 (𝑣) = softmax(h 𝑡,𝑚E[𝑣]), where E[𝑣] is the embedding of item 𝑣. The global reasoning regularization loss is formulated as: KL(𝑝𝑡,𝑚 𝑝𝑡 ,𝑚 ), (7) LKL = 1 𝑇 𝑀 (𝑇 𝑀 1) (𝑡,𝑚) (𝑡 ,𝑚 )(𝑡,𝑚) where the summation iterates over all pairs of distinct reasoning states across all 𝑇 𝑀 positions. This constraint encourages: (i) within each stream, different reasoning steps progressively explore distinct reasoning directions to capture high-order feature interactions; (ii) across different streams, parallel reasoning paths diverge to discover diverse sequence patterns. By penalizing similarity among all reasoning states globally, this mechanism mitigates both intra-stream and inter-stream homogeneity simultaneously. 3.2.2 Reasoning Contrastive Learning. To enhance the models reasoning robustness for better capturing user preferences from sparse interactions, we design Reasoning Contrastive Learning (RCL) objective. Specifically, we introduce dropout strategy along two orthogonal dimensions, representation and interaction, to construct diverse contrastive views. During the forward pass of the Transformer, we simultaneously apply random dropout to both the hidden representations (with dropout rate 𝑝rep) and the attention score matrices (with dropout rate 𝑝attn). By performing two independent forward passes with different dropout realizations, we obtain two augmented versions of reasoning outputs: {h(1) 𝑇 ,𝑀 } and {h(2) 𝑇 ,𝑀 }, where the superscripts denote different dropout masks. 1,1 , . . . , h(2) 1,1 , . . . , h(1) To enforce consistency between the two augmented views, we adopt an in-batch contrastive learning objective [13, 23, 32]. Specifically, for stream 𝑚 at reasoning step 𝑡, we treat the corresponding reasoning states from the two dropout views of the same user as positive pairs, while treating states from other users in the same batch as negative samples. Given batch of 𝐵 users, the contrastive loss for stream 𝑚 at step 𝑡 is defined as: L𝑡,𝑚 RCL = 1 𝐵 𝐵 (cid:18) 𝑖=1 log exp(𝑠 (1,2) /𝜏) 𝑖𝑖 𝑗=1 exp(𝑠 (1,2) 𝑖 𝑗 (cid:205)𝐵 /𝜏) + log exp(𝑠 (2,1) /𝜏) 𝑖𝑖 𝑗=1 exp(𝑠 (2,1) 𝑖 𝑗 (cid:205)𝐵 /𝜏) (cid:19) , 𝑖 𝑗 = where 𝑠 (1,2) (2) 𝑡,𝑚,𝑗 (2) 𝑡,𝑚,𝑗 denotes the cosine similarity between (1) 𝑡,𝑚,𝑖 (1) 𝑡,𝑚,𝑖 different views (similarly for 𝑠 (2,1) ), and 𝜏 is the temperature hyperparameter. The overall reasoning contrastive loss aggregates over all reasoning steps and streams: 𝑖 𝑗 LRCL = 1 𝑇 𝑀 𝑇 𝑀 𝑡 =1 𝑚=1 L𝑡,𝑚 RCL. (8) This objective encourages the model to learn task-relevant representations that remain invariant across different augmented views, thereby enhancing generalization and robustness capabilities. 3.2.3 Mixture-of-Reasoning-Streams Aggregation. To synthesize outputs from multiple reasoning streams, naive uniform averaging risks contaminating superior reasoning outputs with inferior ones, leading to suboptimal final representations. To address this, we propose Mixture-of-Reasoning-Streams (MoRS) aggregation method that adaptively weights different streams. Inspired by gated mechanisms [26, 31, 52], we introduce lightweight gating network to compute stream-specific importance weights. Specifically, we feed the encoded representation h0 (extracted from Henc) into gating network: = softmax(W𝑔h0 + b𝑔), where W𝑔 R𝑀 𝑑 and b𝑔 R𝑀 are learnable parameters, and = [𝑔1, . . . , 𝑔𝑀 ] R𝑀 represents the normalized gating weights Parallel Latent Reasoning for Sequential Recommendation Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY for 𝑀 streams. The final output is then computed as: 𝑀 𝑔𝑚z𝑚, zrea = (9) 𝑚=1 where z𝑚 is the pooled representation from stream 𝑚 (see Eq.(6)). Dual-Process Inference. Motivated by the dual-process theory in human cognitive science [18, 33], which posits that human cognition involves both fast intuitive thinking (System 1) and slow deliberative reasoning (System 2), we combine the encoder output (fast-thinking) with the reasoning output (slow-thinking) during inference. Specifically, the final sequence representation is: zfinal = h0 + zrea, (10) where h0 represents the fast-thinking component directly from the encoder, and zrea encapsulates the refined insights from deliberate multi-stream reasoning. This design leverages both rapid pattern recognition and deep logical inference for next-item prediction."

This design forces the model to develop genuine reasoning capabilities rather than taking shortcuts by relying solely on the fast-thinking encoder output h0. By preventing direct access to the encoder representation during training, we ensure that the model learns to perform deliberate multi-step reasoning. Inference with Dual-Process Integration. During inference, we combine both the fast-thinking and slow-thinking outputs using zfinal (Eq. (10)) to rank candidate items. This dual-process integration leverages the complementary strengths of both reasoning modes: the fast-thinking component h0 provides rapid pattern recognition based on direct encoding, while the slow-thinking component zrea contributes refined insights from deliberate multistream reasoning.

This breakthrough, which extends computation during test time rather than relying solely on encoding capacity, has inspired new era of reasoningenhanced recommendation research. Explicit Reasoning Approaches. The first line of work leverages LLMs logical capabilities to generate explicit reasoning chains for recommendation tasks. RecGPT-series [57, 58] and OneRecseries [25, 68] employ LLMs to verbalize insights about user interests, thereby improving prediction accuracy through interpretable reasoning paths. DeepRec [67] introduces multi-turn interactions for iterative refinement of recommendations, while R2ec [59] unifies reasoning and recommendation within an autoregressive LLM framework. However, explicit reasoning faces two critical challenges: (i) the absence of well-defined, verifiable reasoning chains in recommendation contexts (unlike mathematical or coding tasks with objective ground truth), and (ii) prohibitive inference latency from verbose token generation, rendering these methods impractical for real-time industrial deployment. Latent Reasoning Approaches. To overcome these limitations, an emerging paradigm adopts data-driven latent reasoning in continuous representation space, eliminating the need for explicit CoT annotations while maintaining low latency. ReaRec [35] pioneers this direction by introducing multi-step autoregressive reasoning with ensemble (ERL) and progressive (PRL) learning strategies. LARES [24] proposes architectural decoupling between encoding (pre-blocks) and reasoning (core-blocks) modules, employing selfsupervised pre-training and reinforcement learning for enhanced reasoning quality. OnePiece [8] upgrades to block-wise latent reasoning and introduces multi-task progressive supervision to enhance reasoning quality. LatentR3 [65] extends this paradigm to LLM backbones with RL-based optimization. Despite their promise, existing latent reasoning methods exclusively focus on depth-level computational scaling through sequential reasoning steps, exhibiting diminishing returns and over-thinking issues. In contrast, our work pioneers width-level parallel reasoning, exploring multiple diverse reasoning trajectories simultaneously to unlock further performance gains while maintaining real-time efficiency."

Detailed dataset statistics are presented in Table 1. Feature Construction: For ID-based sequential models (e.g., SASRec, BERT4Rec), we construct item representations using the multilevel category hierarchy, store ID, and item ID provided by the dataset. For text-based models (e.g., UniSRec), we concatenate the item title, hierarchical categories, and store name to synthesize textual descriptions. These text sequences are then encoded using the BGE embedding model [3] to obtain dense sentence embeddings. 6.1.2 Evaluation Metrics. We adopt two widely-used ranking metrics in the field of recommender systems to evaluate models personalized modeling capability: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at (NDCG@K, abbreviated as N@K) and Recall at (R@K). We report results for 𝐾 {10, 20}. NDCG@K accounts for the position of relevant items in the ranking list with logarithmic discount, while Recall@K measures the proportion of ground-truth items successfully retrieved within the top-K recommendations. 6.1.3 Baselines. To comprehensively evaluate PLRs effectiveness, we select three representative backbone architectures and three state-of-the-art latent reasoning-enhanced methods. Base Models. We choose three widely-adopted sequential recommendation models as our backbone architectures: SASRec [19]: pioneering Transformer-based sequential recommendation model that employs unidirectional multi-head selfattention to capture sequential dependencies in user behavior. BERT4Rec [34]: An extension of SASRec that leverages bidirectional self-attention with Cloze task (masked item prediction) for sequence modeling, enabling richer contextual representations. UniSRec [15]: text-based sequential recommender that learns universal item representations through textual features and Mixtureof-Experts (MoE) adapters for cross-domain transfer. Latent Reasoning-Enhanced Methods. We focus exclusively on latent reasoning baselines to ensure fair comparison under comparable inference latency and model capacity. Explicit reasoning approaches and LLM-based methods are excluded due to their prohibitive computational overhead for real-time online serving and vastly different parameter scales. ReaRec-ERL [35]: The first latent reasoning framework for sequential recommendation, which firstly introduces multi-step autoregressive computation in latent space to explore test-time reasoning. ERL (Ensemble Reasoning Learning) aggregates outputs from all reasoning steps via average pooling. ReaRec-PRL [35]: variant of ReaRec that employs PRL (Progressive Reasoning Learning), which incrementally refines representations and uses only the final steps output for prediction. LARES [24]: two-stage reasoning architecture consisting of pre-blocks for encoding and core-blocks for reasoning. LARES incorporates self-supervised pre-training and reinforcement learningbased post-training to enhance reasoning capabilities. We implement different latent reasoning methods on top of the three backbone architectures for comprehensive evaluation. Implementation Details. All experiments are conducted 6.1.4 using the PyTorch framework on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. To ensure fair comparison across all models, we standardize the embedding dimension to 𝑑 = 256 and batch size to 𝐵 = 2048. We employ the Adam optimizer [20] with learning rate of 1𝑒 3 and apply the GeLU activation function. User interaction sequences are truncated to maximum length of 50 items. For text-based models, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the BGE-encoded representations from their original dimensionality to 768 dimensions, preserving the most informative features. For PLR, we perform grid search to determine optimal hyperparameters: the number of reasoning streams 𝑀 and reasoning steps 𝑇 are searched in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; the KL regularization weight 𝜆 is tuned in {1𝑒 3, 1𝑒 2, 1𝑒 1, 1}; dropout rates 𝑝rep and 𝑝attn are set equal and searched in {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6}; and the temperature 𝜏 is fixed at 1. We use early stopping based on validation NDCG@10 with patience of 10 epochs. To optimize inference efficiency, we employ KV Caching technique that stores and reuses the computed key-value pairs from the input sequence encoding across all reasoning streams and steps, significantly reducing redundant computation overhead during multi-stream parallel reasoning."

            "content": "(1) Reasoning-enhanced methods outperform base models across most settings, validating the effectiveness of test-time computational scaling. On CDs & Vinyl with SASRec, ReaRec-ERL improves Recall@10 by 5.15% and Recall@20 by 2.23%. On Movies & TV with BERT4Rec, ReaRec-ERL demonstrates strong improvements of 16.67% in Recall@10 and 13.49% in NDCG@10. These gains validate that allocating additional computation during inference enables deeper reasoning, particularly beneficial for sparse datasets. (2) Among depth-only reasoning methods, ReaRec-ERL generally demonstrates the strongest performance across most scenarios. For instance, on CDs & Vinyl with SASRec, ReaRec-ERL achieves Recall@10 of 0.0572 and NDCG@10 of 0.0269, outperforming both ReaRec-PRL and LARES. However, the performance differences among these methods remain relatively modest, indicating inherent limitations in depth-only reasoning where simply increasing reasoning depth yields diminishing returns. (3) PLR achieves substantial improvements over all baselines across the majority of metrics. On CDs & Vinyl with SASRec, PLR attains 12.07% improvement in Recall@20 over the best baseline ReaRec-ERL, with even more remarkable gains of 14.91% in Recall@10 on UniSRec. While improvements vary across different datasets and metrics, PLR demonstrates superior performance in most scenarios, particularly excelling on sparser datasets like CDs & Vinyl where it achieves over 10% improvements. These results demonstrate that width-level parallel reasoning effectively captures diverse user interests beyond single-trajectory depth reasoning. Crucially, these gains come with minimal inference overhead  (Table 4)  , making PLR practical for real-time systems. Conference acronym XX, June 0305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.

The results demonstrate that each component contributes meaningfully to PLRs performance. Removing MoRS leads to notable performance degradation (Recall@20 drops from 0.0873 to 0.0785 on CDs & Vinyl), validating that adaptive gating effectively identifies superior reasoning streams, consistent with Theorem 4.6. Removing RCL causes decline particularly on Video & Games (Recall@20 drops from 0.1033 to 0.0970), confirming its role in enhancing robustness. Removing KL also leads to performance drops on both datasets, though the degradation is relatively modest, suggesting that diversity regularization provides consistent but moderate benefits. Overall, all components show positive contributions, with MoRS and RCL demonstrating more substantial effects.

These results demonstrate PLRs practical value for real-world recommendation scenarios where user behavioral data is inherently sparse and incomplete. Figure 4: Performance ceiling analysis on the CDs & Vinyl dataset with different backbones. 6.5.2 Performance Ceiling Analysis. To understand the theoretical potential of different reasoning approaches, we analyze performance ceilings by evaluating each reasoning steps output independently and selecting the best-performing step for each user sample (oracle selection). Figure 4 compares current performance (using fixed aggregation strategies) against oracle ceiling performance across three backbones on the CDs & Vinyl dataset. The results reveal that PLR and ReaRec-series achieve comparable oracle ceilings (e.g., NDCG@20 [0.0402, 0.0416]), indicating similar theoretical upper bounds. However, PLR exhibits notably smaller gaps between current and oracle performance, suggesting that its parallel multi-stream design enables more effective utilization of reasoning capacity. In contrast, depth-only methods show larger performance gaps, indicating that appropriate step selection is more critical but challenging without width-level exploration. This demonstrates that PLRs co-design of depth and width provides more accessible path to near-optimal performance, reducing reliance on oracle-level step selection while maintaining competitive ceiling potential. 6.5.3 Efficiency Analysis. To evaluate the computational overhead, we compare the FLOPs and inference latency per sample on the CDs & Vinyl dataset with SASRec backbone. As shown in Table 4, PLR introduces 5.22% additional FLOPs and 5.80% latency increase compared to the base SASRec, which represents remarkably efficient trade-off considering the substantial performance gains. Notably, PLRs computational overhead remains comparable Figure 3: Robustness analysis on the CDs & Vinyl dataset."

Increasing 𝑀 beyond 2 leads to performance degradation, likely because excessive streams introduce redundant reasoning paths that dilute superior streams contributions, and limited training data becomes insufficient for effectively optimizing numerous specialized streams. We set 𝑀 = 2 as the default configuration. Number of Reasoning Steps (𝑇 ). Figure 2(b) shows performance peaks at 𝑇 = 2, then declines with deeper reasoning. This aligns with our theoretical analysis (Theorem 4.4): while moderate reasoning steps enable sufficient refinement, excessive depth causes diversity decay due to Lipschitz contraction. The optimal 𝑇 = 2 balances refinement quality and diversity preservation, confirming the over-thinking phenomenon in depth-only methods. Regularization Weight (𝜆). Figure 2(c) shows optimal performance at 𝜆 = 0.1. Insufficient regularization (𝜆 < 0.1) fails to enforce diversity, allowing streams to collapse into homogeneous patterns. Overly aggressive regularization (𝜆 > 0.1) negatively impacts learning by pushing different reasoning streams too far apart, hindering convergence toward high-quality solutions. Dropout Rate (𝑝). Figure 2(d) indicates that moderate dropout rates 𝑝 [0.2, 0.5] yield the best performance. Low dropout (𝑝 < 0.2) provides insufficient augmentation for contrastive learning, while excessive dropout (𝑝 > 0.5) corrupts reasoning by removing too much information.

Consequently, PLR achieves width-level computational scaling while maintaining real-time inference feasibility, making it practical for industrial deployment where both accuracy and response time are critical. 6.5.4 Attention Visualization Analysis. To provide deeper insights into the multi-stream reasoning mechanism, we visualize the attention distributions across different streams and reasoning steps in Figure 5. The visualization reveals that different streams exhibit distinct attention patterns, focusing on complementary aspects of the input sequence: while one stream concentrates on recent interactions, another explores long-term dependencies. This diversity in attention allocation substantiates that our multi-stream architecture encourages exploration of heterogeneous reasoning paths, enabling more comprehensive coverage of user interests and contributing to PLRs superior performance."

Complete Theoretical Proofs A.1 Proof of Theorem 4.1 (Ensemble Error Decomposition) Proof. For any sequence S𝑢 , the expected negative log-likelihood under 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) is: E𝑣𝑝 [ log 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 )] = 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) log 𝑣 (cid:33) ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) . (cid:32) 1 𝑀 𝑀 𝑚=1 By Jensens inequality (concavity of log): log (cid:32) 1 𝑀 𝑀 𝑚=1 (cid:33) ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) 1 𝑀 𝑀 𝑚=1 log ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 ), with strict inequality when predictions differ. Therefore: E𝑣𝑝 [ log 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 )] = 1 𝑀 1 𝑀 𝑀 𝑚=1 𝑀 𝑚=1 E𝑣𝑝 [ log ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 )] L𝑚 (S𝑢 ), where L𝑚 (S𝑢 ) is the loss of stream 𝑚 on sequence S𝑢 . Taking expectation over S𝑢 yields: Lens Lind. The gap (S𝑢 ) = Lind Lens (S𝑢 ) quantifies the benefit of diverse predictions. By the AM-GM inequality, (S𝑢 ) 0 with equality if and only if all ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) are identical. A.2 Proof of Proposition 4.2 Averaging over all pairs (𝑚, 𝑚): 𝐷 (𝑇 ) = 1 𝑀 (𝑀 1) 𝑚𝑚 h𝑇 ,𝑚 h𝑇 ,𝑚 2 𝐿2𝑇 𝐷 (0) . For 𝐿 < 1, writing 𝐿 = 𝑒 𝛾 with 𝛾 = log 𝐿 > 0 yields the exponential form: 𝐷 (𝑇 ) 𝑒 2𝛾𝑇 𝐷 (0) . (cid:33) A.4 Proof of Theorem 4.6 (Gating Benefit) Proof. For any S𝑢 , by Jensens inequality: (cid:32) 𝑀 E𝑣𝑝 [ log 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 )] = 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) log 𝑤𝑚 (S𝑢 ) ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) 𝑣 𝑣 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) 𝑀 𝑚=1 𝑚=1 𝑤𝑚 (S𝑢 ) log ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) 𝑀 = 𝑤𝑚 (S𝑢 )E𝑣𝑝 [ log ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 )]. 𝑚=1 The gap between gated and uniform ensemble is: Luniform (S𝑢 ) Lgated (S𝑢 ) = E𝑣𝑝 [log 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) log 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 )] . When streams specialize (per-stream losses vary across 𝑚 and S𝑢 ), optimal weighting assigns higher 𝑤𝑚 (S𝑢 ) to streams with lower losses. This gain is quantified by the conditional mutual information: 𝐼 (𝑍 ; 𝑉 S𝑢 ) = 𝑀 𝑚= 𝑤𝑚 (S𝑢 )E𝑣𝑝 (cid:20) log ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) 𝑝 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) (cid:21) , (Diversity-Specialization Connection) Proof. Under linear scoring, ˆ𝑝𝑚 (𝑣 S𝑢 ) = softmax(z𝑚, e𝑣). For two distinct streams 𝑚, 𝑚: which measures how much knowledge of the selected stream 𝑍 reveals about the target 𝑉 . Under specialization, 𝐼 (𝑍 ; 𝑉 S𝑢 ) > 0. ˆ𝑝𝑚 (S𝑢 ) ˆ𝑝𝑚 (S𝑢 )TV 𝛿𝑒 2𝑅 z𝑚 z𝑚 , where TV is total variation distance, 𝑅 bounds item embeddings, and 𝛿𝑒 is minimum embedding separation. By Pinskers inequality, total variation bounds KL divergence: KL( ˆ𝑝𝑚 ˆ𝑝𝑚 ) 1 2 ˆ𝑝𝑚 ˆ𝑝𝑚 2 TV 𝛿 2 𝑒 8𝑅2 z𝑚 z𝑚 2. The specialization benefit (from Jensens inequality gap) is lower bounded by the average pairwise KL divergence: (S𝑢 ) 1 𝑀 (𝑀 1) KL( ˆ𝑝𝑚 ˆ𝑝𝑚 ) Setting 𝑐 = 𝛿 𝑚𝑚 𝑒 /(8𝑅2) > 0 completes the proof. 𝛿 2 𝑒 8𝑅2 𝐷 (S𝑢 ). A.3 Proof of Theorem 4.4 (Diversity Decay) Proof. By the Lipschitz property (Assumption 4.3): h𝑡,𝑚h𝑡,𝑚 = 𝑓 (h𝑡 1,𝑚, r𝑡 )𝑓 (h𝑡 1,𝑚, r𝑡 ) 𝐿h𝑡 1,𝑚h𝑡 1,𝑚 . Iterating from 𝑡 = 0 to 𝑡 = 𝑇 : h𝑇 ,𝑚 h𝑇 ,𝑚 𝐿𝑇 h0,𝑚 h0,𝑚 = 𝐿𝑇 𝝉𝑚 𝝉𝑚 . Squaring both sides: h𝑇 ,𝑚 h𝑇 ,𝑚 2 𝐿2𝑇 𝝉𝑚 𝝉𝑚 2."
