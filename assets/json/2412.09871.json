            "content": "We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), tokenizer-free architecture that learns from raw byte data and, for the first time, matches the performance of tokenization-based models at scale, with significant improvements in efficiency and robustness (6). Existing large language models (llms) are trained almost entirely end-to-end, except for tokenizationa heuristic pre-processing step that groups bytes into static set of tokens. Such tokens bias how string is compressed, leading to shortcomings such as domain/modality sensitivity (Dagan et al., 2024), sensitivity to input noise (6), lack of orthographic knowledge (Edman et al., 2024), and multilingual inequity (Liang et al., 2023; Petrov et al., 2024; Limisiewicz et al., 2024). Tokenization has previously been essential because directly training llms on bytes is prohibitively costly at scale due to long sequence lengths (Xue et al., 2022). Prior works mitigate this by employing more efficient self-attention (El Boukkouri et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2022) or attention-free architectures (Wang et al., 2024) (8). However, this primarily helps train small models. At scale, the computational cost of Transformer is dominated by large feed-forward network layers that run on every byte, not the cost of the attention mechanism. To efficiently allocate compute, we propose dynamic, learnable method for grouping bytes into patches (2) and new model architecture that mixes byte and patch information. Unlike tokenization, BLT has no fixed vocabulary for patches. Arbitrary groups of bytes are mapped to latent patch representations via light-weight learned encoder and decoder modules. We show that this results in more efficient allocation of compute than tokenization-based models. Tokenization-based llms allocate the same amount of compute to every token. This trades efficiency for performance, since tokens are induced with compression heuristics that are not always correlated with the 1 Figure 1 Scaling trends for fixed inference flop models (fully) trained with varying training budgets. In token-based models, fixed inference budget determines the model size. In contrast, the BLT architecture provides new scaling axis allowing simultaneous increases in model and patch size while keeping the same training and inference budget. BLT patch-size (ps) 6 and 8 models quickly overtake scaling trends of bpe Llama 2 and 3. Moving to the larger inference budget makes the larger patch size 8 model more desirable sooner. Both BPE compute-optimal point and crossover point are indicated with vertical lines. complexity of predictions. Central to our architecture is the idea that models should dynamically allocate compute where it is needed. For example, large transformer is not needed to predict the ending of most words, since these are comparably easy, low-entropy decisions compared to choosing the first word of new sentence. This is reflected in BLTs architecture (3) where there are three transformer blocks: two small byte-level local models and large global latent transformer (Figure 2). To determine how to group bytes into patches and therefore how to dynamically allocate compute, BLT segments data based on the entropy of the next-byte prediction creating contextualized groupings of bytes with relatively uniform information density. We present the first flop-controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes, showing that we can train model end-to-end at scale from bytes without fixed-vocabulary tokenization. Overall, BLT matches training flop-controlled performance1 of Llama 3 while using up to 50% fewer flops at inference (5). We also show that directly working with raw bytes provides significant improvements in modeling the long-tail of the data. BLT models are more robust than tokenizer-based models to noisy inputs and display enhanced character level understanding abilities demonstrated on orthographic knowledge, phonology, and low-resource machine translation tasks (6). Finally, with BLT models, we can simultaneously increase model size and patch size while maintaining the same inference flop budget. Longer patch sizes, on average, save compute which can be reallocated to grow the size of the global latent transformer, because it is run less often. We conduct inference-flop controlled scaling experiments (Figure 1), and observe significantly better scaling trends than with tokenization-based architectures. In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: 1) We introduce BLT, byte latent llm architecture that dynamically allocates compute to improve flop efficiency, 2) We show that we achieve training flopcontrolled parity with Llama 3 up to 8B scale while having the option to trade minor losses in evaluation metrics for flop efficiency gains of up to 50%, 3) BLT models unlock new dimension for scaling llms, where model size can now be scaled while maintaining fixed-inference budget, 4) We demonstrate the improved robustness of BLT models to input noise and their awareness of sub-word aspects of input data that token-based llms miss. We release the training and inference code for BLT at https://github.com/facebookresearch/blt."

            "content": "Segmenting bytes into patches allows BLT to dynamically allocate compute based on context. Figure 3 shows several different methods for segmenting bytes into patches. Formally, patching function fp segments 1We calculate the computational cost of model by counting the number of Floating Point OPerations (flops) needed. 2 Figure 2 BLT comprises three modules, lightweight Local Encoder that encodes input bytes into patch representations, computationally expensive Latent Transformer over patch representations, and lightweight Local Decoder to decode the next patch of bytes. BLT incorporates byte n-gram embeddings and cross-attention mechanism to maximize information flow between the Latent Transformer and the byte-level modules (Figure 5). Unlike fixed-vocabulary tokenization, BLT dynamically groups bytes into patches preserving access to the byte-level information. sequence of bytes xxx = {xi, = 1, . . . n} of length into sequence of < patches ppp = {pjj = 1, . . . , m} by mapping each xi to the set {0,1} where 1 indicates the start of new patch. For both token-based and patch-based models, the computational cost of processing data is primarily determined by the number of steps executed by the main Transformer. In BLT, this is the number of patches needed to encode the data with given patching function. Consequently, the average size of patch, or simply patch size, is the main factor for determining the cost of processing data during both training and inference with given patching function (4.5). Next, we introduce three patching functions: patching with fixed number of bytes per patch (2.1), whitespace patching (2.2), and dynamically patching with entropies from small byte lm (2.3). Finally, we discuss incremental patching and how tokenization is different from patching (2.4)."

            "content": "Perhaps the most straightforward way to group bytes is into patches of fixed size as done in MegaByte (Yu et al., 2023). The fixed stride is easy to implement for training and inference, provides straightforward mechanism for changing the average patch size, and therefore makes it easy to control the flop cost. However, this patching function comes with significant downsides. First, compute is not dynamically allocated to where it is needed most: one could be either wasting transformer step if only predicting whitespace in code, or not allocating sufficient compute for bytes dense with information such as math. Second, this leads to inconsistent and non-contextual patching of similar byte sequences, such as the same word being split differently. 3 Figure 3 Patching schemes group bytes in different ways, each leading to different number of resulting patches. Since each patch is processed using large transformer step, the number of patches directly determines the bulk of the compute expended in terms of flops. These schemes group bytes into patches by (a) striding every four bytes (2.1) as in MegaByte (Yu et al., 2023), (b) tokenizing with Byte-Pair Encoding (bpe), in this case the Llama-3 (Dubey et al., 2024) tokenizer, (c & d) entropy-based patching as in this work (2.3), (e) patching on space-bytes (Slagle, 2024), (f) and patching on entropy using small CNN byte-level model with 2-byte context.

Patches end when H(xi) exceeds the global threshold θg, shown as red horizontal line. The start of new patches are shown with vertical gray lines. For example, the entropies of and in George R.R. Martin exceed θg, so is the start of single byte patch and of larger patch extending to the end of the named entity as the entropy H(xi) stays low, resulting in no additional patches."

            "content": "Slagle (2024) proposes simple yet effective improvement over strided patching that creates new patches after any space-like bytes2 which are natural boundaries for linguistic units in many languages. In Space patching, latent transformer step (i.e., more flops) is allocated to model every word. This ensures words are patched in the same way across sequences and that flops are allocated for hard predictions which often follow spaces. For example, predicting the first byte of the answer to the question Who composed the Magic Flute? is much harder than predicting the remaining bytes after since the first character significantly reduces the number of likely choices, making the completion Mozart comparatively easy to predict. However, space patching cannot gracefully handle all languages and domains, and most importantly cannot vary the patch size. Next, we introduce new patching method that uses the insight that the first bytes in words are typically most difficult to predict, but that provides natural mechanism for controlling patch size."

We use “tokens” to refer to byte-groups drawn from a finite vocabulary determined prior to\ntraining as opposed to “patches” which refer to dynamically grouped sequences without a fixed vocabulary.\nA critical difference between patches and tokens is that with tokens, the model has no direct access to the\nunderlying byte features.",
            "content": "A crucial improvement of BLT over tokenization-based models is that redefines the trade off between the vocabulary size and compute. In standard llms, increasing the size of the vocabulary means larger tokens on average and therefore fewer steps for the model but also larger output dimension for the final projection layer of the model. This trade off effectively leaves little room for tokenization based approaches to achieve significant variations in token size and inference cost. For example, Llama 3 increases the average token size from 3.7 to 4.4 bytes at the cost of increasing the size of its embedding table 4x compared to Llama 2. When generating, BLT needs to decide whether the current step in the byte sequence is at patch boundary or not as this determines whether more compute is invoked via the Latent Transformer. This decision needs to occur independently of the rest of the sequence which has yet to be generated. Thus patching cannot assume access to future bytes in order to choose how to segment the byte sequence. Formally, patching scheme fp satisfies the property of incremental patching if it satisfies: bpe is not an incremental patching scheme as the same prefix can be tokenized differently depending on the continuation sequence, and therefore does not satisfy the property above3. fp(xxx<i) = fp(xxx)<i"

Throughout the paper, we use the subscript to denote patches and to denote bytes. The global model uses block-causal attention mask (Dubey et al., 2024), which restricts attention to be up to and including the current patch within the current document. This model consumes the bulk of the flops during pre-training as well as inference, and thus, choosing when to invoke it allows us to control and vary the amount of compute expended for different portions of the input and output as function of input/output complexity. 3Using special delimiter token to indicate patch boundaries can turn bpe into an incremental patching scheme but increases the byte-sequence length."

            "content": "The Local Encoder Model, denoted by E, is lightweight transformer-based model with lE << lG layers, whose main role is to efficiently map sequence of input bytes bi, into expressive patch representations, pj. primary departure from the transformer architecture is the addition of cross-attention layer after each transformer layer, whose function is to pool byte representations into patch representations (Figure 5). First, the input sequence of bytes, bi, are embedded using R256hE matrix, denoted as xi. These embeddings are then optionally augmented with additional information in the form of hash-embeddings (3.2.1). series of alternating transformer and cross-attention layers (3.2.2) then transform these representations into patch representations, pi that are processed by the global transformer, G. The transformer layers use local block causal attention mask; each byte attends to fixed window of wE preceding bytes that in general can cross the dynamic patch boundaries but can not cross document boundaries. The following subsections describe details about the embeddings and the cross-attention block. 3.2.1 Encoder Hash n-gram Embeddings key component in creating robust, expressive representations at each step is to incorporate information about the preceding bytes. In BLT, we achieve this by modeling both the byte bi individually and as part of byte n-gram. For each step i, we first construct byte-grams gi,n = {bin+1, . . . , bi} (2) for each byte position and from three to eight. We then introduce hash n-gram embeddings, that map all byte n-grams via hash function to an index in an embedding table Ehash with fixed size, for each size {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (Bai et al., 2010). The resulting embedding is then added to the embedding of the byte before being normalized and passed as input to the local encoder model. We calculate the augmented embedding ei = xi + (cid:88) n=3,...,8 Ehash (Hash(gi,n)) where, Hash(gi,n) = RollPolyHash(gi,n)%Ehash (3) (4) We normalize ei by the number of n-grams sizes plus one and use RollPolyHash as defined in Appendix C. In Section 7, we ablate the effects of n-gram hash embeddings with different values for and embedding table size on flop-controlled scaling law trends. In addition to hash n-gram embeddings, we also experimented with frequency based n-gram embeddings, and we provide details of this exploration in Appendix D. 3.2.2 Encoder Multi-Headed Cross-Attention We closely follow the input cross-attention module of the Perceiver architecture (Jaegle et al., 2021), with the main difference being that latent representations correspond to variable patch representations as opposed to fixed set of latent representations (Figure 5), and only attend to the bytes that make up the respective patch. The module comprises query vector, corresponding to each patch pj, which is initialized by pooling the byte representations corresponding to patch pj, followed by linear projection, EC RhE (hE UE ), where UE is the number of encoder cross-attention heads. Formally, if we let fbytes(pj) denote the sequence of bytes corresponding to patch, pj, then we calculate P0,j = EC(fbytes((pj)), is pooling function Pl = Pl1 + Wo softmax (cid:18) (cid:18) QK dk (cid:19) (cid:19) where Qj = Wq(Pl1,j), Ki = Wk(hl1,i), Vi = Wv(hl1,i) hl = Encoder-Transformer-Layerl(hl1) (5) (6) (7) (8) where RnphG represents np patch representations to be processed by the global model, which is initialized by pooling together the byte embeddings ei corresponding to each patch pj. Wq, Wk, Wv and Wo are the 4We omit byte-grams of size or more when < n. 6 Figure 5 The local encoder uses cross-attention block with patch representations as queries, and byte representations as keys/values to encode byte representations into patch representations. The local decoder uses similar block but with the roles reversed i.e. byte representations are now the queries and patch representations are the keys/values. Here we use Cross-Attn = 2. projections corresponding to the queries, keys, values, and output where the keys and values are projections of byte representations hi from the previous layer (ei for the first layer). We use masking strategy specific to patching where each query Qj only attends to the keys and values that correspond to the bytes in patch j. Because we use multi-headed attention over Q, and and patch representations are typically of larger dimension (hG) than hE , we maintain Pl as multiple heads of dimension hE when doing cross-attention, and later, concat these representations into hG dimensions. Additionally, we use pre-LayerNorm on the queries, keys and values and no positional embeddings are used in this cross-attention module. Finally, we use residual connection around the cross-attention block."

The local decoder predicts sequence of raw bytes, as function of previously decoded bytes, and thus, takes as input the hidden representations produced by the local encoder for the byte-sequence. It applies series of lD alternating layers of cross attention and transformer layers. The cross-attention layer in the decoder is applied before the transformer layer to first create byte representations from the patch representations, and the local decoder transformer layer operates on the resulting byte sequence. 3.3.1 Decoder Multi-headed Cross-Attention In the decoder cross-attention, the roles of the queries and key/values are interchanged i.e. the byterepresentations are now the queries, and the patch representations are now the key/values. The initial byte-representations for the cross-attention are initialized as the byte embeddings from the last encoder layer i.e. hlE . The subsequent byte-representations for layer l, dl,i are computed as: D0 = hlE (cid:18) Bl = Dl1 + Wo (cid:18) QK dk where Qi = Wq(dl1,i), Ki = Wk(DC(oj)), Vi = Wv(DC(oj)) softmax (cid:19) (cid:19) , Dl = Decoder-Transformer-layerl(Bl) 7 (9) (10) (11) (12) where once again, Wk, Wv are key/value projection matrices that operate on linear transformation and split operation DC, applied to the final patch representations oj from the global model, Wq is query projection matrices operating on byte representations dl1 from the previous decoder transformer layer (or hlE for the first layer), and Wo is the output projection matrix, thus making RhDnb , where nb is the number of output bytes. The next decoder representations Dl are computed using decoder transformer layer on the output of the cross-attention block, B.

In BLT, unlike with tokenization, the patch size can be arbitrarily chosen having significant implications on the context size used by the model. To maintain the same average context length and avoid giving larger patch sizes unfair advantage, we ensure that the number of bytes in each batch remains constant in expectation. This means that we reduce the sequence length of models with larger patch sizes. On Llama 2 data, we use 8k byte context while on the BLT-1T dataset we increase the context to 16k bytes on average while maintaining the same batch size of 16M bytes on average. While the average batch size is constant, when loading batches of data, dynamic patching methods yield different ratios of bytes to patches. For efficiency reasons, our implementation of BLT training packs batches of patches to avoid padding steps in the more expensive latent transformer. This ensures that every batch has the same number of patches. During training we pad and possibly truncate byte sequences to 12k and 24k bytes respectively for Llama 2 and BLT-1T datasets, to avoid memory spikes from sequences with unusually large patches."

            "content": "As illustrated in Figure 6 (right), BLT models either match or outperform their bpe counterparts and this trend holds as we scale model size and flops. To the best of our knowledge, BLT is the first byte-level Transformer architecture to achieve matching scaling trends with BPE-based models at compute optimal regimes. This therefore validates our assumption that the optimal ratio of parameters to training compute for bpe also applies to BLT, or at least it is not too far off. Both architectural improvements and dynamic patching are crucial to match bpe scaling trends. In Figure 6 (left), we compare space-patching-based models against Llama 3. We approximate SpaceByte (Slagle, 2024) using BLT space-patching without n-gram embeddings and cross-attention. Although SpaceByte improves over Megabyte, it remains far from Llama 3. In Figure 6 (right), we illustrate the improvements from both architectural changes and dynamic patching. BLT models perform on par with state-of-the-art tokenizer-based models such as Llama 3, at scale. We also observe the effects of the choice of tokenizer on performance for tokenizer-based models, i.e., models trained with the Llama-3 tokenizer outperform those trained using the Llama-2 tokenizer on the same training data. Finally, our BLT architecture trends between Llama 2 and 3 when using significantly larger patch sizes. The bpe tokenizers of Llama 2 and 3 have an average token size of 3.7 and 4.4 bytes. In contrast, BLT can achieve similar scaling trends with an average patch size of 6 and even 8 bytes. Inference flop are inversely proportional to the average patch size, so using patch size of 8 bytes would lead to nearly 50% inference flop savings. Models with larger patch sizes also seem to perform better as we scale model and data size. BLT with patch size of 8 starts at significantly worse point compared to bpe Llama 2 at 1B but ends up better than bpe at 7B scale. This suggests that such patch sizes might perform better at even larger scales and possibly that even larger ones could be feasible as model size and training compute grow."

This point is achieved at much smaller scales compared to many modern training budgets. trained with an equivalent flop budget. However, with BLT-Entropy we additionally make an inference time adjustment of the entropy threshold from 0.6 to 0.1 which we find to improve task performance at the cost of more inference steps. The BLT-Entropy model outperforms the Llama 3 model on 4 out of 7 tasks while being trained on the same number of bytes. This improvement is like due to combination of (1) better use of training compute via dynamic patching, and (2) the direct modeling of byte-level information as opposed to tokens. On the other hand, BLT-Space underperforms the Llama 3 tokenizer on all but one task, but it achieves significant reduction in inference flops with its larger average patch size of 6 bytes. In comparison, the bpe and entropy-patching based models have roughly equivalent average patch size of approximately 4.5 bytes on the training data mix.

We also report the performance of Llama 3.1 on the same tasks and underline best result overall. BLT outperforms the Llama 3 BPE model by large margin and even improves over Llama 3.1 in many tasks indicating that the byte-level awareness is not something that can easily be obtained with more data. Figure 1 shows that BLT models achieve better scaling trends than tokenization-based architectures for both inference flop classes. In both cases, BPE models perform better with small training budgets and are quickly surpassed by BLT, not far beyond the compute-optimal regime. In practice, it can be preferable to spend more during the one-time pretraining to achieve better performing model with fixed inference budget. perfect example of this is the class of 8B models, like Llama 3.1, which has been trained on two orders of magnitude more data than what is compute-optimal for that model size. The crossover point where BLT improves over token-based models has shifted slightly closer to the computeoptimal point when moving to the larger flop class models (from 3x down to 2.5x the compute optimal budget). Similarly, the larger patch size 8 model has steeper scaling trend in the larger flop class overtaking the other models sooner. As discussed in Section 5.1, larger patch sizes appear to perform closer to BPE models at larger model scales. We attribute this, in part, to the decreasing share of total flops used by the byte-level Encoder and Decoder modules which seem to scale slower than the Latent Transformer. When growing total parameters 20x from 400M to 8B, we only roughly double BLTs local model parameters. This is important as larger patch sizes only affect flops from the patch Latent Transformer and not the byte-level modules. In fact, that is why the BLT-Entropy ps=8 went from 1.6x to 1.7x of the Llama 2 model size when moving to the larger model scale. In summary, our patch-length scaling study demonstrates that the BLT patch-based architecture can achieve better scaling trends by simultaneously increasing both patch and model size. Such trends seem to persist and even improve at larger model scales."

We present these results in Table 3. Noisy Data We create noised versions of the benchmark classification tasks described in Section 5.2, to compare the robustness of tokenizer-based models with that of BLT. We employ five distinct character-level noising strategies to introduce variations in the text: (a) AntSpeak : This strategy converts the entire text into uppercase, space-separated characters.

RandomCase: Converts 50% of the characters to uppercase and 50% to lowercase randomly throughout the text. (d) Repeat: Repeats 20% of the characters up to maximum of four times. (e) UpperCase: Transforms all characters in the text to uppercase. During evaluation, we apply each noising strategy to either the prompt, completion, or both as separate tasks and report the average scores. In Table 3 we report results on noised HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019) and find that BLT indeed outperforms tokenizer-based models across the board in terms of robustness, with an average advantage of 8 points over the model trained on the same data, and even improves over the Llama 3.1 model trained on much larger dataset. Phonology - Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) We assess BLTs capability to map sequence of graphemes (characters representing word) into transcription of that words pronunciation (phonemes). In Table 3, we present the results of the G2P task in 5-shot setting using Phonology Bench (Suvarna et al., 2024) and find that BLT outperforms the baseline Llama 3 1T tokenizer-based model on this task. CUTE To assess character-level understanding, we evaluate BLT on the CUTE benchmark (Edman et al., 2024), which comprises several tasks that are broadly classified into three categories: understanding composition, understanding orthographic similarity, and ability to manipulate sequences. This benchmark poses significant challenge for most tokenizer-based models, as they appear to possess knowledge of their tokens spellings but struggle to effectively utilize this information to manipulate text. Table 3 shows that BLT-Entropy outperforms both BPE Llama 3 models by more than 25 points on this benchmark. In particular, our model demonstrates exceptional proficiency in character manipulation tasks achieving 99.9% on both spelling tasks. Such large improvements despite BLT having been trained on 16x less data than Llama 3.1 indicates that character level information is hard to learn for BPE models. Figure 7 illustrates few such scenarios where Llama 3 tokenizer model struggles but our BLT model performs well. Word deletion and insertion are the only two tasks where BPE performs better. Such word manipulation might not be straightforward for byte-level model but the gap is not too wide and building from characters to words could be easier than the other way around. We use the same evaluation setup in all tasks and the original prompts from Huggingface. BPE models might benefit from additional prompt engineering. Low Resource Machine Translation We evaluate BLT on translating into and out of six popular language families and twenty one lower resource languages with various scripts from the FLORES-101 benchmark (Goyal et al., 2022) and report SentencePiece BLEU in Table 4. Our results demonstrate that BLT outperforms model trained with the Llama 3 tokenizer, achieving 2-point overall advantage in translating into English and 0.5-point advantage in translating from English.

Entropy Model Hyper-parameters To study the effect of varying entropy model size and context window length on scaling performance, we train byte-level entropy transformer models of different model sizes between 1m and 100m parameters, with varying context window lengths from 64 to 512. We plot bpb vs training flop scaling law curves, created using our 400m and 1b BLT models trained on the Llama-2 dataset and present them in Figure 8. We find that scaling performance is positively correlated with both these dimensions of the entropy model, with diminishing returns when we scale beyond 50m parameters. Types of Patching We ablate the four different patching schemes, introduced in Section 2 i.e. 1) Strided Patching with stride of 4 and 6, 2) Patching on whitepsace, 3) BPE Tokenizer patching based on the Llama 3 tokenizer, and 4) Entropy based patching using small byte llm. 16 Figure 8 Variation of language modeling performance in bits-per-byte (bpb) with training flops for 400m and 1b BLT models patched with entropy models of different sizes and context windows.

Table 6 Benchmark evaluations of two patching schemes for 8b BLT models and BPE Llama3 baseline. These models are trained on the Llama 2 data for the optimal number of steps as determined by Dubey et al. (2024). While dynamic patching reduces the effective length of sequences, we control for the sequence length to maintain similar context length for all patching schemes. All the models see the same number of bytes in each sequence during training and inference in expectation to prevent any confounding factors from being able to model larger contexts. Figure 6 highlights the results of these ablations. All the remaining patching schemes outperform static patching, with space patching being very close competitor to dynamic entropy based patching. In Table 6, we present benchmark evaluations for BLT models comparing tokenizer-based models, space patching, and entropy-based patching, trained on the Llama 2 dataset for an optimal number of steps (Dubey et al., 2024). Although space patching is simpler strategy that does not involve running an entropy model on the fly during training, we find that the gains we observed using entropy-based patching on scaling trends (Section 5) do indeed carry forward even to downstream benchmark tasks.7 Cross-Attention In Table 7, we ablate including cross-attention at various points in the encoder and decoder of BLT. For the encoder cross-attention we test initializing the queries with 1) the same learned embedding for every global state, 2) hash embedding of the bytes in the patch, and 3) pooling of the encoder hidden representation of the patch bytes at the given encoder layer. We find that using cross-attention in the decoder is most effective. In the encoder, there is slight improvement in using cross-attention but only with pooling initialization of queries. Additionally, we find that cross-attention helps particularly on Common-Crawl and especially with larger patch sizes. 7Space patching results are from earlier runs without cross-attention, but similar trends are observed even with cross-attention."

Table 8 Ablations on the use of n-gram hash embedding tables for 1B BLT model trained on 100B bytes. We find that hash n-gram embeddings are very effective with very large improvements in BPB. The most significant parameter is the per-ngram vocab size and that smaller ngram sizes are more impactful than larger ones. n-gram Hash Embeddings We ablate settings of 0, 100K, 200K and 400K n-gram hash embedding vocabularies and present results in Table 8. We find that hash embeddings help on all domains, but particularly on Wikipedia and Github (0.04 bpb difference compared to 0.01 bpb difference after 15k steps at 8B). At 8B scale going from 500K to 300K hashes changed performance by 0.001 bpb on 15k steps. This indicates that hashes are vital to bringing the performance of BLT to match those of tokenizer based models, however, after 300K hashes, there are diminishing returns. Additionally, it appears that the gains are largely complementary with cross-attention as they provide improvements on different datasets. Local Model Hyperparamaters In Table 9, we ablate various settings for the number of layers in the local encoder and decoder. When paired with hash n-gram embeddings, BLT works well with an encoder that is extremely light-weight i.e. just one layer, and with heavier decoder."

More layers can then be allocated to the decoder for the same cost. models that outperformed word-level models again on morphologically-rich Turkish and Russian languages. Along similar lines, Zhang et al. (2015) used character-based convolutional models for classification tasks, which outperformed word-level models for certain tasks. Chung et al. (2019) use hierarchical LSTM models using boundary-detectors at each level to discover the latent hierarchy in text, to further improve performance on character level language modeling. ByteNet by Kalchbrenner et al. (2016) uses CNN based layers on characters as opposed to attention for machine translation. Character-Level Transformers: The development of transformer models using attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) together with subword tokenization (Sennrich et al., 2016), significantly improved the performance of neural models on language modeling and benchmark tasks. However, word and sub-word units implicitly define an inductive bias for the level of abstraction models should operate on. To combine the successes of transformer models with the initial promising results on character language modeling, Al-Rfou et al. (2019) use very deep transformers, and with the help of auxiliary losses, train transformer-based models that outperformed previous LSTM based character llms. However, they still saw significant gap from word level LLMs. GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) also observed that on large scale datasets like the 1 billion word benchmark, byte-level LMs were not competitive with word-level LMs. While Choe et al. (2019) demonstrated that byte-level llms based on transformers can outperform subword level LLMs with comparable parameters, the models take up much more compute and take much longer to train. Similarly, El Boukkouri et al. (2020) train BERT model (CharFormer) that builds word representations by applying convolutions on character embeddings, and demonstrate improvements on the medical domain, but they also expend much more compute in doing so. Clark et al. (2022) develop CANINE, 150M parameter encoder-only model that operates directly on character sequences. CANINE uses deep transformer stack at its core similar in spirit to our global model, and combination of local transformer and strided convolutions to downsample the input characters, and outperforms the equivalent token-level encoder-only model (mBERT) on downstream multilingual tasks. ByT5 (Xue et al., 2022) explored approaches for byte-level encoder decoder models, that do not use any kind of patching operations. While their model exhibited improved robustness to noise, and was competitive with tokenizer-based models with 4x less data, the lack of patching meant that the models needed to compute expensive attention operations over every byte, which was extremely compute heavy. Directly modeling bytes instead of subword units increases the sequence length of the input making it challenging to efficiently scale byte level models. Recently, using the Mamba Architecture (Gu and Dao, 2023), which can maintain fixed-size memory state over very large context length, Wang et al. (2024) train byte-level Mamba architecture also without using patching, and are able to outperform byte-level transformer models in flop controlled setting at the 350M parameter scale in terms of bits-per-byte on several datasets. Patching-based approaches: The effective use of patching can bring down the otherwise inflated number of flops expended by byte-level LLMs while potentially retaining performance, and many works demonstrated initial successes at small scale of model size and number of training bytes. Nawrot et al. (2022) experiment with static patching based downsampling and upsampling and develop the hourglass transformer which outperforms other byte-level baselines at the 150M scale. Nawrot et al. (2023) further improve this with the help of dynamic patching schemes, including boundary-predictor that is learned in an end-to-end fashion, boundary-predictor supervised using certain tokenizers, as well as an entropy-based patching model similar to BLT, and show that this approach can outperform the vanilla transformers of the time on language modeling tasks at 40M parameter scale on 400M tokens. Lester et al. (2024) investigate training on sequences compressed using arithmetic coding to achieve compression rates beyond what BPE can achieve, and by using equal-info windows technique, are able to outperform byte-level baselines on language modeling tasks, but underperform subword baselines. Our work draws inspiration and is most closely related to MegaByte (Yu et al., 2023), which is decoder only causal LLM that uses fixed static patching and concatenation of representations to convert bytes to patches, and uses local model on the decoder side to convert from patches back into bytes. They demonstrate that MegaByte can match tokenizer-based models at 1B parameter scale on dataset of 400B bytes. We ablate MegaByte in all our experiments and find that static patching lags behind the current state-of-the-art compute optimally trained tokenizer based models in flop controlled setting and we demonstrate how BLT bridges this gap. Slagle (2024) make the same observation about MegaByte and suggest extending the static patching method to patching on whitespaces and other space-like bytes, and also add local encoder model. They find improvements over tokenized-based transformer models in compute controlled setting on some domains such as Github and arXiv at the 1B parameter scale. We also report experiments with this model, and show that further architectural improvements are needed to scale up byte-level models even further and truly match current state-of-the-art token-based models such as Llama 3."

            "content": "In this work, for the purposes of architectural choices, we train models for the optimal number of steps as determined for Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024). However, these scaling laws were calculated for BPE-level transformers and may lead to suboptimal (data, parameter sizes) ratios in the case of BLT. We leave for future work the calculation of scaling laws for BLT potentially leading to even more favorable scaling trends for our architecture. Additionally, many of these experiments were conducted at scales upto 1B parameters, and it is possible for the optimal architectural choices to change as we scale to 8B parameters and beyond, which may unlock improved performance for larger scales. Existing transformer libraries and codebases are designed to be highly efficient for tokenizer-based transformer architectures. While we present theoretical flop matched experiments and also use certain efficient implementations (such as FlexAttention) to handle layers that deviate from the vanilla transformer architecture, our implementations may yet not be at parity with tokenizer-based models in terms of wall-clock time and may benefit from further optimizations. While BLT uses separately trained entropy model for patching, learning the patching model in an end-to-end fashion can be an interesting direction for future work. In Section 6.2, we present initial experiments showing indications of success for byte-ifying tokenizer-based models such as Llama 3 that are trained on more than 10T tokens, by initializing and freezing the global transformer with their weights. Further work in this direction may uncover methods that not only retain the benefits of bytefying, but also push performance beyond that of these tokenizer-based models without training them from scratch."

            "content": "This paper presents the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), new architecture that redefines the conventional dependency on fixed-vocabulary tokenization in large language models. By introducing dynamic, learnable method for grouping bytes into patches, BLT effectively allocates computational resources based on data complexity, leading to significant improvements in both efficiency and robustness. Our extensive scaling study demonstrates that BLT models can match the performance of tokenization-based models like Llama 3 at scales up to 8B and 4T bytes, and can trade minor losses in evaluation metrics for up to 50% reductions in inference flops. Furthermore, BLT unlocks new dimension for scaling, allowing simultaneous increases in model and patch size within fixed inference budget. This new paradigm becomes advantageous for compute regimes commonly encountered in practical settings. While directly engaging with raw byte data, BLT also improves the models ability to handle the long-tail of data, offering significant improvements in robustness to noisy inputs and deeper understanding of sub-word structures. Overall, these results position BLT as promising alternative to traditional tokenization-based approaches, providing scalable and robust framework for more efficient and adaptable language models."

For each {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} there is an embedding matrix Engram that contains the most frequent byte-grams for the given n. Since it is intractable to store embeddings as grows, we only store embeddings for the most frequent 100, 000 byte-grams for each byte-gram. If particular position includes an n-gram present in the corresponding the embedding matrix, then this embedding is passed to the next step, encoder multi-headed cross-attention. If byte-gram is infrequent and therefore not in the matrix, then its embedding is obtained from encoder hash embeddings instead. Since frequency-based n-grams are limited by the vocabulary of the n-gram tables with infrequent n-grams not being represented at all, we subsequently moved to hash-based n-gram embeddings. See Table 12 for comparison of hash and frequency based n-gram embeddings.

            "content": "We illustrate how few-shot example from downstream task i.e. MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), is patched using an entropy-model trained for use with BLT models in Figure 9. Directly using the entropy model with the full-context window causes repetitive patterns to be heavily patched. For example, 10 times, with an rms deviation of about in the MMLU query is patched frequently the first time it is encountered, but is part of very large patches the next three times, which, although inference efficient, maybe undesirable for reasoning. One method that we use to avoid such entropy drift is by resetting the entropy context with new lines and using approximate monotonicity constraint (see Section 4.4). 26 Figure 9 An example of default entropy-based patching with global threshold during inference on mmlu. Green denotes the prompt, Blue denotes the few-shot examples, and red denotes the question to be answered. Note that the size of the patches for the repeated phrases in the answer choices is much larger, which means that the global model is invoked significantly fewer times than its tokenizer-based counterpart, with this inference patching scheme."
