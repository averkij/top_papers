            "content": "Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become widely used approach to enhance the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), e.g., OpenAI o3 [42], DeepSeek-R1 [18], and Seed1.5-VL [24]. Through the RLVR training procedure, the model can possess the ability to perform complex reasoning actions [15, 28], e.g., self-reflection, self-verification, and self-correction, which can also be called the large reasoning model (LRM). During the RLVR training process, the LRMs first explore and reason over given question, and then verifier provides rewards for the generated solutions. The LRMs learn from these experiences and gradually acquire the ability to perform complex reasoning behaviors [14, 58]. Although RLVR has achieved substantial success in effectively improving the reasoning capabilities of LRMs, series of studies [41, 65, 71, 74] have pointed out that RLVR struggles to raise the upper bound of model performance, thereby hindering continued capability growth in later training stages. To alleviate this issue, prior work [16, 17, 22, 61] has focused on designing reward functions and advantage functions to encourage LRMs to explore and solve more challenging problems, thereby enhancing the models exploration capability. Despite encouraging the model to explore, supervision provided only at the outcome level, which is the popular RLVR training settings [18, 50], offers limited guidance for effective exploration [38], leaving the model in state of largely blind exploration [54, 64, 78]. In this case, the models exploration often leads to failure in solving the given problems, which will be punished by the RLVR process, causing the model to adopt conservative reasoning strategies and reduce further exploration. In the RLVR procedure, which is low-information setting [11, 36], the loss of the models exploration capability implies that further training is unlikely to yield performance improvements [20, 63, 74], limiting the scaling process. Existing studies [38] have discussed the amount of information provided to the model by different training methods, noting that RLVR can only supply less information than the distillation process. Following this theory, to increase the amount of information available during RLVR training, one can introduce distilled data or manually annotated data. We consider whether decomposing the original problem into subproblems and providing them as additional information to the model can further raise its performance upper bound, since we observe that some prior work suggests that planning then reasoning can achieve better performance [21, 43]. To verify this hypothesis, we conduct the empirical study and present the results in Fig. 1. The model achieves higher Pass@k scores with subquestion-based prompts, indicating that the model already possesses the requisite knowledge to solve the task and can effectively integrate this knowledge to reach solution when guided appropriately. This phenomenon suggests that the model lacks compositional generalization, i.e., the ability to combine simple knowledge components to solve complex problems [5, 37], demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating additional information into RLVR and sub-question guidance can serve as one of the effective forms of additional information. To provide additional information to the RLVR procedure, prior work (e.g., LUFFY [67] and Scaf-GRPO [77] has guided the model to perform more effective exploration during RLVR training by introducing data generated by powerful model (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) as prompts, including knowledge point, planning, and solution. These methods rely on stronger models to annotate data, which on one hand incurs higher costs, and on the other hand, they remain within the paradigm of imitation learning, making it difficult for the student model to surpass the upper bound of the teacher model [52, 60]. According to the above discussion, we consider whether it is possible to start from single model and, by employing different tasks and RLVR training methods, derive hint model and reasoning model. Based on given problem, the hint model can supply additional information to assist the reasoning model in performing more effective exploration. In this setting, the decomposer and reasoner trained from the same model can mutually reinforce each other, thereby enabling model self-evolution and surpassing its reasoning performance limits. Building on this idea, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Ability Decomposing method for enhancing the effectiveness of RLVR, named as A2D. Concretely, we first utilize RLVR to train decomposer that can serve as the hint model and decompose the original questions into simple sub-questions, providing additional information for training the reasoning model, since decomposing problem can help the model solve the complex original tasks [46, 79]. Next, differing from earlier studies that simply insert prompt-generated answers into the training dataset [67, 77], we utilized in-context distillation loss (IDL) to guide the model to learn from the experiences obtained through sub-question-guided exploration. This makes our algorithm plug-and-play component, capable of adapting to various RLVR algorithms. In summary, the major contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: To provide more information without relying on external models, we propose A2D, training decomposer and reasoner starting from the same model. The decomposer is used to decompose questions, and the decomposed sub-questions serve as additional information to assist the reasoner during RLVR. We evaluate and compare our A2D with competitive baselines on eight mathematical tasks to validate the effectiveness. With the assistance of sub-question guidance from the decomposer, the reasoner is able to explore more effectively during various RLVR algorithms and achieve better performance. We analyze the decomposer and its training process, revealing how different methods affect its performance and behavior. We also find that specific and fine-grained hints help improve the reasoners Pass@1 score, while abstract and coarse-grained hints can enhance the reasoners Pass@k score."

In the RLVR training dataset = {(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖)}𝑛 , the 𝑖-th training instance contains question description 𝑥𝑖 and ground truth answer 𝑦𝑖. Give the question 𝑥, policy with the parameter 𝜃 (denoted as 𝜋 𝜃 ) is required to generate solution with final answer ˆ𝑦. Once the predicted answer ˆ𝑦 is obtained, verifier will be utilized to verify its correctness and provide the reward 𝑟 based on the ground truth answer 𝑦. When the predicted answer is correct, the verifier provides positive reward 𝑅pos, while it provides negative reward 𝑅neg for other situations. Based on question 𝑥, generated solution and answer ˆ𝑦, and reward 𝑟 from the verifier, following the process of GRPO, the objective function of the RLVR can be formulated as follows, (𝜃) = ( 𝑥,𝑦)D,{ˆ𝑦 }𝐺 𝑖=1 𝜋𝜃 ( 𝑥) 𝐺 𝑖=1 1 ˆ𝑦𝑖 ˆ𝑦𝑖 𝑡=1 (cid:16) min 1 𝐺 𝑟𝑖,𝑡 ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 , clip (cid:0)𝑟𝑖,𝑡 , 1 𝜀, 1 + 𝜀(cid:1) ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 𝛽𝐷KL , (cid:17) (1) where 𝑟𝑡 and ˆ𝐴𝑡 refer to the importance sampling coefficient and estimated advantage values, and 𝐺 denotes the number of generated responses based on question 𝑥.

            "content": "Given the large consumption of data annotating for the SFT process of the decomposer, we consider utilizing RLVR to guide the LLMs to learn to decompose the complex question through self-exploration. In the following, we first introduce the construction of the training dataset of the decomposer 𝜋 𝜃D , and then present the details of the RLVR process. 3 Figure 2 The comparison between vanilla RLVR and our approach A2D. In A2D, we first train decomposer 𝜋 𝜃D through RLVR, guided by the format reward 𝑅F and quality reward 𝑅Q. Next, we use this decomposer to annotate sub-questions for each question in the training dataset, and design the in-context distillation loss (IDL), i.e., Eq. 5, to integrate the sub-question guidance into the RLVR process for reasoner 𝜋 𝜃R . To better demonstrate the pipeline of our A2D, we present the pseudo code in Algorithm 1. Training Dataset Construction. We collect the question and its corresponding answer to construct an instance of the training dataset. Formally, we construct training dataset = {𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖}𝑛 , where 𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖, and 𝑛 denote the question, the corresponding ground truth answer, and the number of training data. As discussed in previous work [45, 70], decomposing the original question is essentially planning process, during which the model possesses greater capacity to explore potential solution strategies. Under this assumption, we think that the trained decomposer can provide useful guidance for the subsequent training of the reasoner, even though no additional information is introduced throughout the entire training process. 𝑖=1 RLVR Training Procedure. To effectively train the Decomposer, we design multi-dimensional reward function, including both quality reward 𝑅Q and format reward 𝑅F. Concretely, to evaluate the quality of the sub-questions generated from decomposer, we conduct proxy reasoner to generate the solution for 𝑛proxy times based on the original question and the decomposed sub-questions. The quelity reward is set to 1 if and only if at least one of the 𝑛proxy attempts is correct (i.e., 𝑅Q = 1). Otherwise, the quality reward is set to 0 (i.e., 𝑅Q = 0). Moreover, for the format reward, we examine whether the responses from the decomposer satisfy the required format, i.e., whether it uses <subquestion> to indicate the beginning of the decomposed sub-questions and whether the corresponding content is non-empty (The details can be found in Appendix B). The format reward will be set to 1 when and only when the response passes the format examination (i.e., 𝑅F = 1), while it will be set to 0 in other situations (i.e., 𝑅F = 0). After obtaining the quality reward and format reward, we compute the final reward for response from the decomposer by multiplying 𝑅Q and 𝑅F, i.e., 𝑅 = 𝑅Q 𝑅F. With this reward design, we encourage the model to produce responses in the correct format and to assist the proxy reasoner in generating correct answers, thereby reducing the likelihood of reward hacking. In practice, we utilize GRPO [50] to train the decomposer based on the above reward function."

After that, we provide the methods to integrate this loss function into the RLVR algorithms. Annotating Training Data with Sub-question Hint. In Sec. 2.2, we introduce the approach to train decomposer only with the dataset containing questions and corresponding answers = {𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖}𝑛 . This dataset will also be utilized in the RLVR process of the reasoner. To provide additional guidance for the training procedure of the reasoner, we use the decomposer to decomposer each question in the training dataset and annotate it with list of its potential sub-questions. Formally, given the question 𝑥𝑖, the decomposer will decompose this question into several sub-questions S𝑖 = {𝑠𝑖,1, . . . , 𝑠𝑖, 𝑝 }, and construct them into triples 𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖, S𝑖. After annotating all questions in the dataset D, we construct the training dataset with sub-question hint using the above triples, i.e., DSQ = {𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖, S𝑖}𝑛 . These sub-questions can be viewed as an idea of solving the corresponding question. After the reasoner sequentially addresses these sub-questions, it is likely to arrive at the solution to the original problem. 𝑖=1 𝑖=1 In-context Distillation Loss. In this part, we introduce in-context distillation loss (IDL) to enhance the models capabilities after RLVR training with the guidance of the sub-question hint. IDL can be regarded as plug-and-play component that is compatible with various RLVR algorithms. Specifically, given the question 𝑥𝑖 and its decomposed sub-questions S𝑖, the reasoner generates multiple solutions ˆY = {ˆ𝑦 }. With the guidance of sub-questions S𝑖, the generated solutions ˆY are more likely to contain the correct answer. After generation, we verify the correctness of each response in ˆY, obtaining the corresponding rewards }. Based on the rewards of the solutions, we can select the positive solutions to fine-tune {𝑅 the parameters of the reasoner 𝜋 𝜃R . Since no sub-question hints are available during real testing, we train the model to generate solutions directly from the question, aiming to internalize the correct problem-solving strategies into the inner knowledge of the reasoner. The loss function can be formulated as follows, , . . . , ˆ𝑦 , . . . , 𝑅 𝑖,𝑛rollout 𝑖,𝑛rollout 𝑖,1 𝑖, LIDL (𝜃R) = 1 𝑁pos 𝑛rollout 𝑗=1 𝜋 𝜃R (ˆ𝑦 𝑖, 𝑗 𝑥𝑖) I[𝑅 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1], 𝑁pos = 𝑛rollout 𝑗=1 I[𝑅 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1], (3) 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1] is an indicator function, which returns 1 when and only when 𝑅 where I[𝑅 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1 and returns 0 for other situations. By optimizing the reasoners parameters 𝜃R to minimize the loss function LIDL, the reasoner 𝜋 𝜃R can learn more from these hints, enabling it to surpass its prior performance boundary. Integrating IDL into RLVR Procedure. Following the process of vanilla RLVR training, for given problem, we first have the reasoner generate multiple solutions ˆY = {ˆ𝑦𝑖,1, . . . , ˆ𝑦𝑖,𝑛rollout }, and then compute the reward for each solution as well as the average reward 𝑅. For integrating the IDL function into the RLVR training process, the purpose is to provide auxiliary guidance for questions on which the reasoner is unable to obtain correct answers through the rollout process. Following this motivation, we preset threshold 𝑘1 (0 < 𝑘1 < 1) such that when the average reward falls below this threshold (i.e., 𝑘1 > 𝑅), the IDL is applied. Otherwise, the IDL is not activated. Moreover, since the reasoner 𝜋 𝜃R is likely to follow the guidance to solve the question, the generated responses might show high similarity to each other. Thus, to prevent overfitting, we collect the positive response generated under the sub-question guidance ˆY, and retain at most 𝑘2 𝑛rollout (0 < 𝑘2 < 1) positive responses. Formally, the set of the selected positive responses can be denoted as ˆY Sel = {ˆ𝑦𝑖,1,Sel, . . . , ˆ𝑦𝑖,𝑞,Sel}, 𝑞 = min(𝑁pos, 𝑘2 𝑛rollout). (4) Furthermore, we observe that several generated solutions in ˆY are not rigorous, as they might fail to consider Sel the scenarios not covered in the hints, thereby performing imprecise reasoning. In this situation, directly fine-tuning the parameters of the reasoner on these imprecise data will hurt its performance. Therefore, we appended different prompts to the original problem and used these prompts to segment the models capabilities, as mentioned in previous work [25, 26, 51]. The following formula presents the adjusted IDL, IDL (𝜃R) = 1 ˆY Sel ˆY Sel 𝑗=1 𝜋 𝜃R (ˆ𝑦 𝑖, 𝑗,Sel𝑥𝑖, 𝑝). (5) Based on the above discussion, we can rewrite the function of IDL and integrate it into the training process of RLVR, which can be formulated as follows, where (𝜃R) is the objective function of RLVR (Eq. 1), and 𝛼 is hyperparameter to balance the effect of the above two objective functions. LA2D (𝜃R) = (𝜃R) + 𝛼L IDL (𝜃R) I[𝑘1 > 𝑅], (6)"

Datasets. We utilize the dataset proposed in previous work [15] as the training dataset for the decomposer and reasoner. To perform the evaluation, we adopt eight mathematical benchmarks as the downstream tasks, including AIME24 [2], AIME25 [3], AMC23 [4], BeyondAIME [9], MATH500 [35], Minerva [40], OlymMATH-Easy [56], and OlymMATH-Hard [56]. Baselines. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct several popular approaches as the baselines in our evaluation, including SFT-based and RLVR-based methods. For SFT-based methods, we utilize seed-1.6 (no_thinking mode) [10] to generate the solution and leverage the generated instances to perform SFT on the backbone models (i.e., SFT w/ CoT). Besides, given the sub-questions generated by the decomposer mentioned in our approach (Sec. 2.2), we combine these generated sub-questions and the solutions mentioned above to conduct the SFT process (i.e., SFT w/ CoT & SQ). For RLVR-based methods, we compare the performance of our approach with the previous work, i.e., LUFFY [67] and Scaf-GRPO [77]. Since these two approaches require an external teacher model to provide guidance, to conduct fair comparison, we utilize our well-trained decomposer mentioned in Sec. 2.2 to provide the guidance. Implementation Details. We adopt the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the backbone model of the decomposer and employ GRPO [50] as the backbone RLVR algorithm for the whole training process.

During the training of the Decomposer, we use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the proxy reasoner. Once the Decomposer is trained, its decomposed sub-questions can assist not only the RLVR training of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct but also that of Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct and other models from the LLaMA family, yielding performance improvements for these models. This indicates that the trained Decomposer can guide the training of various models without requiring specific training for different reasoners, demonstrating that our method A2D is both efficient and effective. Third, comparing the two SFT-based training methods, we find that adding decomposer-generated subquestions to the training data does not improve model performance. Instead, it even leads to performance degradation in certain scenarios, e.g., AIME25 and AMC23. The underlying reasons are twofold. First, learning to decompose the original question may not directly aid in solving it, as these are two dissimilar abilities. Second, although the decomposer-generated sub-questions can stimulate exploration that occasionally leads to the correct answer, they do not necessarily represent complete reasoning process and may overlook certain cases. For these reasons, directly learning the decomposer-generated sub-questions does not contribute to improving the models reasoning ability. Our method effectively avoids this issue by leveraging the decomposed sub-questions through the IDL function, thereby providing richer guidance for the RLVR process. Finally, directly training the model using teacher-generated solutions that do not contain the thinking process (i.e., SFT w/ CoT and LUFFY) is unlikely to yield improvements and may even impair the models reasoning ability. possible explanation for this phenomenon is that these backbone models have already learned substantial amount of instructions during post-training. Further training on such data may lead to overfitting, 7 Table 2 Results of the ablation study.

Compared to SFT with CoT, LUFFY introduces data distilled from the teacher model only when the model struggles to answer question, reinforcing knowledge that the model has not yet mastered and thereby partially alleviating the overfitting caused by learning from teacher data. However, this approach requires the introduction of an external model and relies on the teacher model possessing strong capabilities to produce correct and complete reasoning processes."

Ablation Study about Training Process of Decomposer. To evaluate the capability of the decomposer, we concatenate the sub-questions that it generates with the original question as combined prompt, and then ask the LLM (i.e., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) to produce an answer. We report the Pass@k score in the top part of Table 2. Based on the evaluation results, the Format Reward and Pass@k Reward both contribute to the enhancement of the capacities of decomposer. Format Reward teachs decomposer to generate formal list of subproblems, and Pass@k Reward helps it to present the sub-problems that are more likely to guide the reasoner to arrive at the correct answer. By training with the above two rewards, the decomposer can better assist the subsequent RLVR training process of the reasoner, thereby improving the training effect. Ablation Study about RLVR with Sub-question Guidance. In the bottom part of the Table 2, we present the results of removing Selection and Deversirty Prompt mechanism of our approach. We can observe the decrease of the models performance without these two modules. For problems that the model is already capable of solving through its own exploratory reasoning, it is unnecessary to introduce additional external guidance, so as to avoid potential conflicts between such guidance and the models inherent problem-solving trajectory. For problems that require external guidance, training with diverse prompts can mitigate the influence of external knowledge on the model, thereby improving its overall performance. 8 Table 3 Accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct trained through different approaches on mathematical tasks.

Theoretically, our approach is orthogonal to existing RLVR methods and can be combined with other RLVR algorithms to improve their training effectiveness. To further validate our approach experimentally, we collected commonly used RLVR training algorithms (e.g., GRPO [50], RLOO [1], and REINFORCE++ [27]) and combined A2D with these methods. The results are presented in Table 3. From the experimental results, we observe that traditional RLVR algorithms can enhance the models reasoning ability. Building on these algorithms, our A2D can further improve the models capabilities and achieve better performance on downstream tasks. For more challenging tasks (e.g., AIME25 and BeyondAIME), vanilla RLVR struggles to yield improvements, as the models limited capabilities make it difficult to discover correct solutions through self-exploration and thus produce accurate answers. In such cases, the decomposers breakdown of the original problem can provide the reasoner with novel problem-solving strategies, extending its capability boundaries and enabling it to tackle these more complex tasks during the RLVR training process. Through our analysis, we find that A2D can be adapted to various RLVR algorithms, effectively enhancing the models capabilities."

In Fig. 3a, we observe that adding sub-questions generated by the decomposer into the prompt (i.e., Prompt w/ SQ) leads to improvements in both the Pass@1 score and the Pass@k score. This phenomenon indicates that decomposing the original problem can guide large models to explore and reason more effectively, resulting in improved performance. This also serves as one of the key motivations behind our method. Moreover, we added sub-question hints to both the training and test sets and trained the reasoner using GRPO on this augmented data i.e., GRPO + Prompt w/ SQ. In Fig. 3b, we compare its performance with our approach (i.e., GRPO + A2D). We observe that in the early stages of training (first 100 steps), GRPO + Prompt w/ SQ achieves better performance. This is because the sub-question hints can directly provide the reasoner with solution strategies, leading to improved reasoning performance. However, as training progresses, the model becomes overly reliant on the sub-question hints provided by the decomposer for reasoning, which diminishes its exploratory capability and prevents further improvement in reasoning performance. In contrast, during the training of A2D, the model uses hints only when the question is sufficiently difficult, while relying on self-exploration in all other cases. As result, A2D does not lead to rapid decline in the models exploratory ability and enables the model to achieve better performance on downstream tasks through RLVR."

First, by examining the number of sub-questions produced by the decomposer and the number of generated tokens, we observe that both remain at relatively low levels. Specifically, on average, question can be decomposed into two sub-questions, and describing these sub-questions requires only about 60 tokens. This phenomenon indicates that the sub-questions produced by the decomposer operate at relatively high level of abstraction and can be regarded as coarse-grained reasoning process rather than step-by-step solution. Moreover, we find that the responses generated by the decomposer do not contain keywords related to the final answer, indicating that the decomposer provides problem-solving guidance without revealing the solution itself, thereby not constraining the reasoners reasoning and exploratory process. Such decomposer can provide the reasoner with guidance and inspiration while retaining certain degree of exploratory capability, which is precisely what we aim for. The decomposer does not engage in overly detailed reasoning that would excessively reinforce exploitative behavior and consequently diminish its exploratory capacity."

In Fig. 4, we present the case study of the generated sub-questions of different models, i.e., our method (i.e., A2D) and the approach that removes the Format Reward while using the Pass@1 Reward to replace the Pass@k Reward (i.e., A2D w/o Format Reward w/ Pss@1 Reward). The example problem involves sets and requires knowledge of intersections and unions. The model trained with our method decomposes this problem into two sub-questions: first, it identifies that the problem involves sets, guiding the reasoner to select relevant knowledge for solving the problem; then, it guides the reasoner to apply this knowledge to the specific question. The Decomposer performs relatively coarse-grained decomposition of the problem, which can inspire the reasoner to explore while preventing over-reliance on the hints. This phenomenon reflects the effect of using the Pass@k Reward during training. In contrast, the model trained by removing the Format Reward and using the Pass@1 Reward instead of the Pass@k Reward produces more concrete content, with the sub-questions degenerating into step-by-step reasoning solutions. This phenomenon indicates that high-level, coarse-grained hints can guide the models exploration, thereby improving its Pass@k performance. In contrast, fine-grained hints better enhance the models exploitative capability, leading to higher Pass@1 performance. The analysis of the models generated content validates the rationale of our training method."

During the RLVR process, the reward design [7, 55], advantage shaping [16, 17, 19], and sampling mechanism [62, 81] are leveraged to unlock the potential of LRMs, balancing their exploration and exploitation that guides them to find the global optimal. In addition to enabling the model to perform exploration via one-step generation, previous works [8, 12, 31, 70] have employed reward models to provide supervision signals for reasoning steps, thereby facilitating more robust reasoning. Besides, existing work [75] also adopts outcome-level reward models to guide the reasoning processes of the models. Given that models can effectively solve simple problems but struggle with multi-hop reasoning tasks [44, 66, 77], this work focuses on how to guide the model to transfer its ability to solve subproblems toward solving more complex problems, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of RLVR. In principle, our approach is orthogonal to previous work and can be effectively combined with those methods."

The training instances that contains the complex actions for the SFT process are usually distilled from the powerful teacher models [23, 29], e.g., GPT-5 or Gemini-2.5-pro. Moreover, previous studies have shown that responses from the teacher model [67, 77] and self-reflection [32, 49] can be used to elicit the reasoning ability of LRMs, in the RLVR process. Besides, parallel reasoning enhances the performance of LRMs by enabling the model to explore multiple reasoning paths and obtain the final answer based on the previous generation [39, 47, 53], which is an alternative way of leveraging natural language guidance. In this work, we investigate the use of the tips (i.e., the sub-problems derived from the decomposition of the original problem) during training to aid the model in accurately solving these problems and to activate its internal knowledge."

However, the compositional generalization ability of LLMs is limited [6, 48, 68]. Specifically, the model has acquired some basic knowledge, but it still cannot combine these related pieces of knowledge to solve more complex tasks, e.g., puzzle tasks [13, 16] and question answering tasks [34, 69]. To improve such an ability of LLMs, previous studies usually adopt several simple problems to synthesize the hard multi-hop problems and utilize these problems to perform training process [57, 73], or utilize multi-turns reasoning solve the complex problems step-by-step [33, 80]. The compositional generalization ability is vital for the self-evolution of LLMs [48, 68], such as RLVR, where LLMs should explore the potential solutions to the given question based on their knowledge and learn from these experiences [76, 77]. Inspired by this, in this work, we focus on teaching LLMs to combine the knowledge it has learned to answer complex questions in RLVR, which can increase the efficiency of the models exploration, thereby improving the training effectiveness."

Concretely, we first trained decomposer to decompose the complex questions into several subquestions, and then utilized these generated sub-questions to assist the RLVR procedure of the reasoner. With the additional information, the reasoner can explore more effectively and further enhance its reasoning ability during the RLVR process. To better understand the features of the decomposer, we conducted detailed analysis of its training approach and the behaviours after training. Through our experiments, we find that abstract and coarse-grained hints, e.g., sub-question guidance, are beneficial for enhancing the models exploration ability, whereas concrete and fine-grained prompts are more effective for improving the models exploitation ability. Our work investigated how to guide the model toward more effective exploration. 12 In future work, the compatibility between the decomposer and the reasoner is promising direction for future research. As the reasoners capability improves, the style and granularity of the hints provided by the decomposer should also evolve accordingly. Furthermore, whether our algorithm can be extended to online settings is also an important question for future exploration. While AI assistants help humans solve problems, they must also continuously evolve and improve based on real feedback provided by users."
