            "content": "Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 (Jaech et al., 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), have greatly improved performance on complex reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022). However, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) (Schulman et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2024), these models often generate unnecessarily long reasoning chains, causing substantial computational overhead. Prior work (Sui et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024b; Kumar et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025) has identified this overthinking Figure 1: Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism: accurate answer achieved via Continue-Thinking behavior, but not when No-Thinking process is suppressed. phenomenon, where redundant reasoning persists even for simple questions, such as which is larger, 0.9 or 0.11?, despite efforts such as short-chain datasets and length-based rewards. Ideally, LRMs should dynamically adjust their reasoning length, using detailed reasoning for complex problems and minimal or no reasoning for simple ones to maximize efficiency. Recent work (Ma et al., 2025; Yue et al., 2025) systematically explored LRM performance in No-Thinking mode,1 where models generate answers without explicit reasoning chains. These studies show that LRMs can still achieve high accuracy under the NoThinking mode, especially as the number of parallel samples increases. Our empirical analysis reveals that this is partly because models sometimes implicitly supplement the reasoning process during answer generation, particularly for challenging questions, phenomenon we refer to as Continue1Implemented by adding an output prefix such as Think- *Corresponding author. ing finished. or no_think. 1 Thinking. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1, when the model engages in Continue-Thinking, it successfully arrives at the correct answer for challenging problem. In contrast, the model fails to answer correctly. We term this Continue-Thinking phenomenon as the Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism, indicating that models possess preliminary ability for difficulty perception and reasoning budget allocation. However, while this self-adaptive behavior is promising, our analysis reveals two major limitations: (1) models often fail to sufficiently engage in Continue-Thinking behavior on more difficult questions, resulting in incomplete reasoning and lower accuracy; and (2) they may unnecessarily invoke Continue-Thinking on simple questions, leading to overthinking and inefficiency. These issues highlight the need for more accurate difficulty perception and more rational allocation of reasoning resources. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Self-Recovery Reasoning (ASRR) framework, which guides LRMs to dynamically adjust reasoning length based on problem difficulty. ASRR introduces an accuracy-thresholded reward mechanism: length penalties are applied only when sufficient accuracy is achieved within group, balancing efficiency and correctness. Experiments across various models and benchmarks show that ASRR significantly reduces reasoning length while maintaining performance. Moreover, ASRR enhances the correlation between Continue-Thinking frequency and problem difficulty, reflecting improved difficulty perception and budget allocation. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: We quantitatively analyze the upper bounds of LRMs under both Long-Thinking and No-Thinking modes, and identify the Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism behind the Continue-Thinking behavioral pattern. We propose the ASRR Framework, which enables LRMs to better perceive problem difficulty, thereby making more effective utilization of the Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism to flexibly allocate reasoning budget across various questions. We introduce an accuracy-adaptive reward regulation mechanism that conditionally applies and scales length penalties based on grouplevel accuracy, thereby preventing premature brevity at low accuracy and effectively suppressing overthinking as accuracy improves. Empirical evaluations against multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our proposed ASRR."

            "content": "In this section, we first present our systematic analysis, which reveals that LRMs possess latent ability to supplement missing reasoning steps during answer generation, phenomenon we term the Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism. Building upon this observation, we then introduce our proposed Adaptive Self-Recovery Reasoning framework. 2.1 Observations and Motivations In this section, we analyze the Internal SelfRecovery Mechanism of LRMs and explore the impact of the No-Thinking prefix on model performance. We conduct exploratory experiments and quantitative analysis on four benchmarks: AIME 2024 (AIME), OlympiadBench, AMC 2023 (AMC), and MATH500. Figure 2: Pass@256 on four benchmarks. First, we evaluate the model under two settings: (1) Long-Thinking Mode, where response including full reasoning process and answer summarization, and (2) No-Thinking Mode, where nonreasoning prefix (e.g., Okay, think have finis appended to the prompt to ished thinking.) discourage explicit reasoning. For both settings, we perform 256 parallel forward passes and compute the pass@256 metric. Surprisingly, our results show that Long-Thinking and No-Thinking Modes achieve nearly identical performance, with an average pass@256 of 86.4% and 84.98% across four benchmarks, respectively (see Figure 2). Further analysis across benchmarks and individual cases reveals that this is primarily due to the emergence of Continue-Thinking behavior under the Figure 3: Overview of reasoning mode effects in LRMs. (a) Pass@1 and pass@256 under different reasoning modes: the models pass@1 drops sharply across the three modes. (b) Insufficient reasoning leads to failure on difficult problem. (c) Overthinking causes the model to change correct answer to an incorrect one. No-Thinking mode. As the cases reported in Appendix B.1, the LRMs often continue to generate reasoning steps and answers even after receiving No-Thinking prefix, effectively following reasoning trajectory similar to Long-Thinking. To better understand this effect, we exclude samples exhibiting Continue-Thinking behavior, and observe that the pass@256 score of No-Thinking mode drops significantly, with the average dropping from 84.98% to 74.98%. The largest drop occurs on AIME 2024, where the score falls from 73.33% to 46.66%, shown in Figure 2). Moreover, we observe strong positive correlation between the frequency of Continue-Thinking behavior and the difficulty of the benchmark: the Continue-Thinking ratio is 42.6% on AIME 2024(the most difficult), 19.7% on OlympiadBench, 22.2% on AMC 2023, and only 9.4% on MATH500(the easiest). These indicate that the model inherently possesses preliminary difficulty awareness and answer verification capability, and that Continue-Thinking behavior constitutes the Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism of LRMs. However, the current difficulty perception and budget allocation abilities of LRMs still exhibit notable limitations. We analyze the pass@1 metric compared to the above pass@256 under different reasoning modes, shown in Figure 3(a). comparison of pass@256 and pass@1 across benchmarks reveals key limitation: while No-Thinking mode achieves similar pass@256 to Long-Thinking mode on hard problems (e.g., only 3.4% drop on AIME 2024), its pass@1 performance drops much more sharply (by 16.9%). This indicates that the model struggles to consistently supplement reasoning for difficult questions in single-pass settings. Meanwhile, on easier benchmarks, the model still generates unnecessarily long outputs, reflecting persistent overthinking, shown in Figure 3(c) for instance. These results highlight the need for mechanisms that enable LRMs to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on problem difficulty, without sacrificing overall performance. 2.2 Adaptive Self-Recovery Reasoning Framework To address the aforementioned issues, we propose Adaptive Self-Recovery Reasoning (ASRR), dynamic reasoning optimization framework that leverages the Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism of LRMs. The core objective of ASRR is to achieve balance between difficulty perception and reasoning budget allocation by explicitly suppressing unnecessary reasoning while allowing implicit recovery when needed. As illustrated in Figure 4, ASRR comprises two main components: Explicit reasoning suppression and implicit self-recovery: Under No-Thinking mode, this module uses special output prefixes to activate simplified reasoning mode, encouraging the model to skip redundant reasoning steps for simple problems, yet allowing implicit recov3 Figure 4: Overview of the ASRR framework. Under No-Thinking mode, special prefixes suppress unnecessary reasoning while allowing implicit self-recovery on harder problems. RL training incorporates dynamic length penalty based on group-level accuracy to encourage adaptive reasoning. After training, LRMs can adaptively perceive problem difficulty and switch reasoning modes during inference. ery for more challenging cases. Dynamic length penalty (DLP): This module applies dynamic length penalty based on accuracy thresholds, adaptively penalizing excessive reasoning only when the model achieves sufficient accuracy at the group-level. This framework is designed to enhance both the efficiency and accuracy of LRMs across tasks of varying complexity. Below, we detail the design and implementation of each module. 2.2.1 Explicit Reasoning Suppression and Implicit Self-Recovery Under No-Thinking Mode Motivated by our observations of the models Continue-Thinking behavior, we find that LRMs can internally recover reasoning steps even when explicit reasoning is suppressed. To harness this capability, we introduce training strategy under the No-Thinking mode that explicitly suppresses reasoning by appending special prefix to the input prompt, while still enabling implicit self-recovery. Formally, given pretrained reasoning language model LLMθ and dataset = {(xi, yi)}N i=1, where each instance consists of an input prompt xi and final answer yi (without intermediate reasoning traces). For each input xi, we construct an augmented prompt through No-Thinking prefix injection: xi = xi pterm, pterm = Okay, have finished thinking., (1) where denotes string concatenation, and pterm denotes the No-Thinking prefix. Given the augmented prompt, the model generates an output sequence = (y1, ..., yT ) according to the conditional probability: Pθ(yxi) = (cid:89) t=1 Pθ(ytxi, y<t) (2) Through this design, we expect No-Thinking mode to enable efficient inference by: Explicit Reasoning Suppression: For simple inputs where the intrinsic task difficulty (xi) is low, the prefix pterm is intended to bias the model towards generating direct answers, minimizing the expected number of reasoning tokens: [ℓreason(yxi) (xi) < γ] 0 (3) where ℓreason(yxi) denotes the length of the reasoning segment in y. Implicit Recovery: For more difficult inputs (T (xi) γ), we expect the model to internally activate latent reasoning pathways, resulting in longer, but necessary, answergeneration sequences: [ℓreason(yxi) (xi) γ] > 0 (4) To further improve model performance and effectively reduce the reasoning length overhead in this mode, we introduce dynamic regulation mechanism described below. 2.2.2 Dynamic Length Penalty (DLP): Accuracy-Aware Reward Regulation Traditional length penalties enforce output shortening in all cases, but this often leads to two issues: 4 (a) The model sacrifices correctness to minimize length, resulting in short but wrong outputs. (b) The penalty is too weak to suppress overthinking, leading to accurate but verbose reasoning. To address this, we design conditional penalty mechanism that balances efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we dynamically adjust both the timing and strength of the length penalty: the penalty is only activated when the model achieves an accuracy threshold τ , and its strength increases progressively as performance improves. Group-wise Accuracy Thresholding. We partition the training data into groups and compute the average group accuracy AccG as sampling proceeds. The length penalty is activated only when AccG τ , where τ is pre-defined threshold. Overlong Ratio and Reward Formulation. For each group, the overlong ratio Oi for each sample is computed as: Oi = clip (cid:18) Li Lcorrect_shortest Lwindow (cid:19) , 0, 1 (5) where Lcorrect_shortest is the minimal generation length among correctly answered samples in the group, and Lwindow is constant length penalty window. The overall reward for each sample is then given by: Ri = I(yi = ˆyi) (cid:125) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) Correctness Reward α Oi (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) Length Penalty (6) where I() is the indicator function for answer correctness, and α is the penalty strength coefficient. Dynamic Penalty Strength. The penalty coefficient α is dynamically tuned based on group accuracy: α = (cid:40) 0 β(AccG τ +ϵ) 1τ +ϵ if AccG < τ otherwise (7) where β is scaling factor that sets the upper bound of the penalty, and ϵ is small constant to ensure numerical stability. When the accuracy AccG is below the threshold τ , the length penalty is disabled (α = 0), allowing the model to focus solely on maximizing correctness without the risk of premature length optimization. As the accuracy reaches or exceeds the threshold (AccG τ ), the length penalty is progressively introduced, encouraging the model to reduce redundant reasoning while still maintaining correctness. This dynamic balancing mechanism allows the model to first master answer correctness, and then gradually optimize for efficiency, ultimately achieving short yet accurate reasoning process."

We compare four settings: the original model, GRPO long-chain reasoning, No-thinking prompt (zero-shot), and our proposed ASRR. As shown in the table, GRPO significantly improves the models reasoning accuracy but still produces long generation chains. The No-thinking prompt drastically reduces output length, but at the cost of substantial accuracy drop, especially on challenging benchmarks such as AIME In contrast, our frameand Olympiad Bench. work achieves notable reduction in generation length with only minimal performance degradation. On the 1.5B model, the average generation length is reduced by 32.5% compared to GRPO, with only 1.2 percentage point drop in pass@1 accuracy. For the 7B model, the generation length is reduced by 25.7%, while the performance drop is merely 0.6 percentage points. These results demonstrate that our method enables efficient budget allocation by leveraging the Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism of the LRMs: it suppresses unnecessary reasoning on simple problems while flexibly triggering additional reasoning steps on more difficult instances to maintain high accuracy. This validates the effectiveness of our adaptive framework in balancing reasonFigure 5: Illustration of the trade-off between inferencetime thinking length and pass@1 accuracy, across various length-controlled LRMs. Figure 5 illustrates the trade-off between inference-time thinking length and performance (pass@1 accuracy) for various length-controlled LRMs, with our approach evaluated under different accuracy thresholds (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Each point on the graph represents our methods reasoning results across benchmarks at these accuracy settings. We compared our approach against other budget control algorithms on AMC and AIME datasets. Detailed results about more benchmarks are available in Appendix D. ASRR significantly enhances performance within constrained thinking token budgets. For example, at the 100% accuracy threshold, our approach achieves superior accuracy levels compared to other budget constraint methods. This suggests Figure 6: Continue-Thinking Ratio (primary y-axis) and pass@1 accuracy (secondary y-axis) of our method on six subplots, including AIME, Olympiad Bench, AMC, MATH500, GSM8K, and the average across all five benchmarks. The x-axis in each subplot represents model size (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and 7B). Our method enables adaptive thinking strategies under the Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism: Achieves 80.6% (1.5B) and 81.5% (7B) Continue-Thinking ratios on high-difficulty AIME tasks, significantly higher than the 2.6% (1.5B) and 0.3% (7B) ratios observed on low-difficulty GSM8K. that ASRR empowers the model to reason more efficiently, maximizing the effectiveness of limited token budget. In summary, ASRR not only advances accuracy but also optimize computational efficiency by smartly allocating token resources according to task demand, thereby achieving the balance between performance and efficiency. 3.4 Difficulty Awareness Figure 6 demonstrates our methods dynamic thinking capabilities across mathematical reasoning tasks of varying difficulty levels. Through the proposed Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism mechanism, models autonomously adjust their thinking chains based on perceived problem complexity: (1) On the most challenging AIME tasks, ContinueThinking ratios reach 80.6% (1.5B) and 81.5% (7B), corresponding to 75% (1.5B: 24.8%43.3%) and 110% (7B: 27.7%58.1%) relative improvements in pass@1 accuracy over No-Thinking mode. This confirms that prolonged thinking chains substantially enhance reasoning capacity for complex problems. (2) On elementary GSM8K problems, models maintain high pass@1 accuracy at 85.4% (1.5B) and 91.0% (7B) with minimal ContinueThinking ratios (2.6% and 0.3% respectively), demonstrating effective computation-cost awareness without sacrificing performance. These results demonstrate that our approach enables the model to allocate computation adaptively, focusing resources on more difficult problems while remaining efficient on simpler tasks. 3.5 Safety Alignment Improvement Recent research (Huang et al., 2025) has demonstrated that LRMs are prone to generating unsafe or harmful outputs when prompted to engage in unnecessary or irrelevant reasoning chains. Our proposed approach selectively enables the model to perform reasoning only when necessary, while avoiding extended reasoning on straightforward or potentially unsafe queries. This targeted reasoning mechanism significantly enhances the safety alignment of LRMs. Table 2: Harmless rate () on BeaverTails and HarmfulQA for DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and 7B. Method BeaverTails HarmfulQA DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B Original Model + GRPO Ours (τ = 100%) 72.1% 70.1% 83.2%(+13.1%) 61.1% 61.7% 83.4%(+21.7%) DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B Original Model + GRPO Ours (τ = 100%) 81.5% 86.8% 91.8%(+5.0%) 89.3% 90.4% 96.8%(+6.4%) 7 As presented in Table 2, our method achieves substantial improvements in harmless rates on both the BeaverTails and HarmfulQA benchmarks across different model sizes. Specifically, for DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, our approach improves the harmless rate on BeaverTails from 70.1% (GRPO) to 83.2% and on HarmfulQA from 61.7% to 83.4%, representing gains of +13.1% and +21.7%, respectively. Similarly, for the 7B model, our method increases the harmless rate on BeaverTails from 86.8% to 91.8% and on HarmfulQA from 90.4% to 96.8%, corresponding to improvements of +5.0% and +6.4%. These results indicate that our selective reasoning strategy not only preserves or enhances task performance but also serves as an effective means for improving safety alignment. By reducing unnecessary reasoning, our method makes LRMs more robust and trustworthy when deployed in real-world applications, effectively mitigating potential safety risks associated with overthinking or adversarial prompts."

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) enhance large language models by increasing inference-time computation (Snell et al., 2024) rather than simply scaling parameters. Chainof-Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2022), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps, significantly boosts performance on complex tasks. Building upon this, recent works further optimize reasoning via reinforcement learning, leading to advanced models such as OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024), DeepSeekR1 (Guo et al., 2025), Kimi k1.5 (Team et al., 2025), and QwQ (Qwen et al., 2025). Trained with answer-based rewards, these models autonomously extend reasoning chains at inference, achieving substantial gains on challenging tasks like advanced mathematics and logical reasoning (Zhang et al., 2025b; Shao et al., 2024). Efficient Reasoning. Despite significant advances in reasoning, LRMs often exhibit the overthinking problem (Sui et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024b; Kumar et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025): for simple questions, they generate unnecessarily long and redundant reasoning chains, leading to inefficiency. Prior research has addressed this issue from several perspectives: (a) Model Optimization: utilizes techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Yu et al., 2025; Kang 8 et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025b) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Shen et al., 2025; Rafailov et al., 2023; Han et al., 2024) to enable fine-grained control over output length by curating datasets with short reasoning chains. Reinforcement learning with length-based rewards (Luo et al., 2025; Arora and Zanette, 2025; Qu et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025) encourages concise reasoning. While some hybrid models combine reasoning and nonreasoning modules (Liu et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025) to balance performance and efficiency. (b) Prompt Control: use varying prompts to enforce reasoning models to generate concise CoT with less unnecessary reasoning steps (Chen et al., 2024a; Xu et al., 2025a; Aytes et al., 2025; Chuang et al., 2025). (c) Dynamic Reasoning Step Control: focuses on optimizing the best-of-N sampling, , for example by pruning low-quality samples (Xie et al., 2023; Liao et al., 2025) or implementing early stopping strategies (Zhang et al., 2025a; Yang et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025) to reduce superfluous computation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on explicit control mechanisms or prompt engineering to reduce redundant reasoning, our method enables LRMs to adaptively allocate reasoning effort based on task difficulty. By introducing accuracythresholded length rewards, we achieve efficient and adaptive reasoning without sacrificing performance or requiring additional control structures."

Such adaptive mechanisms could further enhance the robustness and applicability of our method across wider range of tasks and domains. Limited Evaluation on Model Scale and Architecture. Our current experiments primarily focus on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. We have not systematically explored the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across broader range of model architectures and sizes. As model scale and architecture can have significant impact on reasoning ability and length control, future work should include comprehensive evaluations on diverse models to better understand the scalability and robustness of our method. Human Evaluation. Our current analysis focuses on complex mathematical reasoning tasks and relies primarily on automatic evaluation metrics. Although we have conducted case studies, detailed and quantitative human evaluation results are lacking. Incorporating comprehensive human evaluations across wider range of tasks will help provide deeper insights into the strengths and potential limitations of our approach. This remains an important direction for future work."

We are given the equation = in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z), and we are asked to determine the shape it describes. Lets analyze this step by step. Step 1: Understand Cylindrical Coordinates In cylindrical coordinates, point is represented as (r, θ, z), where: ... Step 2: Analyze the Equation = The equation = is independent of both and θ. That means: ... This is the definition of plane that is horizontal (i.e., parallel to the xy-plane) and located at height = c. Hmm, let me double-check this conclusion. If = and both and θ can vary freely, then were describing all points at fixed height. Yes, thats definitely plane. Step 3: Eliminate Ambiguity Lets verify this by converting the equation to Cartesian coordinates for clarity. In cylindrical coordinates: ... Final Answer The shape described by the equation = in cylindrical coordinates is plane. Table 5: Responses of Qwen3-8B.

The equation = in cylindrical coordinates specifies constant height z. In cylindrical coordinates, and θ can vary independently while is fixed. This describes horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at the height = c. QwQ-32B Line (A) is incorrect because line would require two coordinates to be fixed or related linearly, but here only is fixed. Circle (B) would require both and θ to be constrained, which isnt the case here. Plane (C) is correct because all points with the same z-coordinate form plane. Sphere (D) involves relation with all coordinates squared and summed, which isnt the case here. Cylinder (E) typically requires fixed r, but here can vary. Cone (F) involves relationship between and z, which isnt present here. Thus, the answer is (C). However, wait second. In cylindrical coordinates, plane is indeed represented by = c. ... But hold on, remember that in some contexts, maybe the cylinder is when is fixed? Let me think. cylinder (circular) would be when = c, which is cylinder around the z-axis. ... ... But let me check an example: if is 5, then every point where the z-coordinate is 5, regardless of and θ, so thats horizontal plane at height 5. So yes, definitely plane. So (C).

This is reflected in their low pass@1 performance under the No-Thinking setting. Table 7 presents case illustrating that the model fails to effectively utilize Continue-Thinking to correctly solve challenging problemeven after additional reasoning, the answer remains incorrect. Table 8 shows case where the models unnecessary Continue-Thinking on simple problem leads to overthinking: the initial answer was correct, but further reasoning resulted in an incorrect response. prompt Let ABCDEF be convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon. To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Additionally, the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. 1. Understanding the Hexagon: Equilateral Hexagon: All sides are equal in length. Convex: All internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Opposite Sides Parallel: AB DE, BC EF, and CD FA. 2. Analyzing the Triangle: The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the extensions of the opposite sides of the hexagon. 3. Setting Up the Proportions: ... 4. Calculating the Ratio: ...Lets try another solution. The sides of the triangle (200, 240, 300) are in the ratio 200 : 240 : 300, which simplifies to 5 : 6 : 7.5. The side length of the hexagon relates to these sides proportionally. 5. Determining the Hexagons Side Length: By analyzing the proportions and considering the properties of similar triangles, we can find that the side length of the hexagon is 60. DeepSeek-R1Distill-Qwen-7B Final Answer: The side length of the hexagon is 60 . Table 7: Solution to the hexagon problem with step-by-step explanation. 17 prompt Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats. In how many ways can we form subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party? To solve the problem of forming subcommittee with at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. Method: Complementary Counting First, we calculate the total number of ways to form subcommittee of 5 members without any restrictions. This is given by the combination formula: (cid:0)14 5 Next, we subtract the number of subcommittees that are composed entirely of Republicans and those composed entirely of Democrats. The number of all-Republican (cid:1), and the number of all-Democrat subcommittees is (cid:0)8 5 (cid:1). subcommittees is (cid:0)6 5 So, the formula is: ... (cid:1). Subtracting the all-Republican and all-Democrat subcommittees from the total gives: 2002 56 6 = (8) QwQ-32B Therefore, the number of ways to form subcommittee with at least one member from each party is 1940. Wait, hold on. Let me check my calculations again to be sure. Double Check Alternatively, lets consider all valid combinations (at least one from each party): (cid:1) = 8 15 = (cid:1) (cid:0)6 1 Republican and 4 Democrats: (cid:0)8 4 1 120 (cid:1)(cid:0)6 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats: (cid:0)8 3 2 560 (cid:1) = 2820 = ... (cid:1) = 56 1 = (cid:1) (cid:0)6 5 Republicans and 0 Democrat: (cid:0)8 0 5 56 Summing these: 120 + 560 + 840 + 420 + 56 = 1996 Therefore, the answer is 1996 .
