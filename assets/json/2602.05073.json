Introduction LLM-based agents operating in open-world environments take actions that have real consequences: making costly bookings, modifying databases, or issuing irreversible commands (Google, 2025; OpenAI, 2025) at the next level of autonomy (Steinberger, 2026). In such settings, failures are no longer limited to incorrect text generation: agents may act prematurely under unresolved ambiguity, propagate errors across long interaction trajectories, or commit to outcomes that are costly or difficult to undo. To be deployed responsibly, agents must be able to assess and act upon the likelihood of failure (Kochenderfer, 2015). This makes reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) an urgent and central requirement for agentic systems. Despite the importance, most existing UQ research treats LLMs as static oracles: system examined in isolation, prompted once, and evaluated by the uncertainty of single response or chain of responses (Figure 1, left). These methods implicitly assume static system in which no new information is acquired after the initial prompt (Farquhar et al., 2024; Kadavath et al., 2022; Malinin and Gales, 2021). Under this assumption, uncertainty is treated as point-wise estimate or uni-directional propagation. While appropriate for single-turn inference and non-interactive multi-step reasoning, they do not meet the growing needs of UQ in agentic AI settings featured by its long-horizon interactive environment. Interactive agents operate in multi-turn interactive environments with feedback from users, tools, and external systems (Figure 1, right). For example, flight-booking agent may need to decide whether to finalize Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents Figure 1 Comparison between UQ setups. Traditional LLM UQ (a) measures the uncertainty of an answer given question, whereas the UQ for LLM reasoning (b) expands the problem by considering multi-step responses rather than single response. Agent UQ (c) goes further by considering continual interactions between agent and user/environment across the trajectory, making it multi-turn, interactive inference setup (example sourced from 𝜏 -bench Airline; Barres et al. (2025)). reservation or ask follow-up questions about dates, budget, or layover preferences. Early uncertainty should prompt information-seeking actions, while subsequent dialogue and database queries can resolve ambiguities and reduce uncertainty, enabling confident execution. Here, uncertainty does not strictly accumulateit may also decrease as direct consequence of interaction, even as the trajectory grows longer. In this paper, we argue that making LLM agents trustworthy requires shift in focus: from pointwise uncertainty of answers to structured uncertainty flow in open, interactive decision processes; and new framework is necessary for this. We present the following perspective: Uncertainty quantification for an LLM agent must incorporate interactivity to model reducible uncertainty: in non-isolated, agentic systems, total uncertainty should be allowed to decrease as new information is acquired through interaction. To ground this perspective in formal discussion, we first provide concrete definition of agent UQ and general formulation that captures broad categories of existing UQ setups (Sec. 3). Specifically, we model the agents problem-solving trajectory as stochastic process over actions, observations, and environment states, represented as simple graphical model. Then, we define both turn-level and trajectory-level uncertainty in simple, probabilistic expression, where we show that many prior UQ approaches arise as special cases. This unified view also exposes fundamental limitation of existing methods: uncertainty is implicitly treated as accumulating monotonically along the trajectory, regardless of the role played by different actions; thus fails to relate uncertainty to task reward. To address this limitation, we introduce in Sec. 4 conceptual framework that models agent UQ as conditional uncertainty reduction process, through an information-gating mechanism that operationalizes the distinction between uncertainty-increasing and uncertainty-reducing actions by considering their interactivity. We further derive the analytic bounds that improve the interpretability of the resulting uncertainty estimates. 2 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents Figure 2 Graphical model for an agent problem-solving trajectory with examples. Given task specification 𝐸0 and an initial user query 𝑂0, an agent spans multi-turn trajectory characterized by chain of action 𝐴, observation 𝑂, and environment state 𝐸. This simple abstraction describes some representative agentic prompting methods such as ReAct (Yao et al., 2022). See Appendix A.1 for details. In addition, Sec. 5 discusses practical implications of agent UQ across diverse domains, including healthcare, software engineering, and robotics, as well as frontier LLM research on adaptive reasoning and post-training. Finally, we outline open problems unique to uncertainty modeling in agentic systems (Sec. 6). Together, we view this work as step toward providing the field with necessary foundation and clearer direction for future research on uncertainty-aware agentic systems. We formalize agent UQ as distinct problem setup and show why existing LLM UQ formulations are insufficient for interactive agent setups. To tackle that limitation, we present conceptual framework for agent UQ by viewing it as conditional uncertainty reduction process. To give actionable insights and promote discussion, we describe promising examples of agent UQ applications in various domains and also remaining open problems. 2. Related Work In contrast to classic UQ (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016; MacKay, 1992; Neal, 1992), LLM UQ in LLMs. UQ brings extra challenges from its computational cost and free-form outputs. Common approaches include aggregating output token probability (Aichberger et al., 2024; Duan et al., 2024; Fadeeva et al., 2024; Fomicheva et al., 2020; Malinin and Gales, 2021; Zhang et al., 2023, 2025b), measuring consistency over samples (Farquhar et al., 2024; Manakul et al., 2023; Nikitin et al., 2024), verbalizing confidence (Kadavath et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022; Yona et al., 2024), or conformal prediction (Cherian et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2023; Quach et al., 2024). While promising, they mostly use single-step question-answering as testbed, which limits their practical applicability to agentic setups. UQ in reasoning and agent setups. Beyond single-step generation, researchers show growing interest in measuring the confidence of LLMs during their reasoning. This kind of (un)certainty information has been used to improve the quality of response (Fu et al., 2025; Kang et al., 2025b; Wang et al., 2023) or to guide model during inference or training (Cheng et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2024; Lightman et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025a,b; Zhu et al., 2025). Recently, there have also been attempts to model uncertainty in interactive and/or agentic setups (Chan et al., 2025; Duan et al., 2025; Frankel et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025). Although UQ here aims to model uncertainty dynamics over long-horizon generation, existing methods do not capture the reducible nature of uncertainty in open environments (Kirchhof et al., 2025b), highlighting the need for new framework for agent UQ. 3 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents 3. General Formulation for Agent UQ 3.1. Problem Statement and Definitions Imagine flight booking agent depicted in Figure 1 right. Here, the types of action 𝐴 and observation 𝑂 are diverse: for 𝐴, there is information-seeking, questioning for clarification, calling an API function, and thinking or updating without interactive behaviors. The observation 𝑂, on the other hand, can be database status report, tool-calling results, or the users clarification. Both action and observation can be displayed in flexible forms of natural language messages or structured strings, e.g., code. Concretely, given task specification 𝐸0, e.g., flight booking, user makes stochastic initial query 𝑂0, and the agent first requests the users ID to get relevant information. Then, it calls programmed function to get privileged information from the database. Not only does the agent interact with the user or tool, but it also thinks about better future actions (i.e., planning) or makes system update without external observation 𝑂 = {}. All interactions and other actions are stored in environment state 𝐸 for context-grounded actions over long horizon inference. This makes up trajectory ℱ𝑡 (chain of 𝐴, 𝐸, and 𝑂) up to 𝑡-turn which continues until the task-specific termination rule is met, e.g., when the agent submits an answer (Jimenez et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2018), the user generates stop sign (Barres et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2024), or goal completion (Shridhar et al., 2021) with multiple constraints (Xie et al., 2024). Now, to formalize UQ in this real-world agent context, we begin with concrete definition of the agent system in Definition 1, and introduce graphical model for the agent trajectory in Figure 2. This can generalize many existing agent benchmark setups (Jimenez et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Mialon et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2024). Definition 1 (Stochastic Agent System). Let 𝐸𝑖 be an environment state, mixture of context memory of agent-user-tool interaction logs up to the 𝑖-th turn that is fully accessible to the agent, and state of the system database, which is not directly accessible to the agent (only partially observable via toolcalling). Let 𝑂𝑖 and 𝐴𝑖 be the 𝑖-th turn observation and action derived from distributions 𝑃 and 𝑃𝜋,𝒯 , respectively, where 𝒯 indicates tool set and 𝜋 is an LLM policy. Then, under task specification 𝐸0 and the users initial query 𝑂0, we define the trajectory as sequence of turns ℱ𝑇 = {(𝐴𝑡, 𝐸𝑡, 𝑂𝑡)}𝑇 𝑡=0 where ℱ0 = (𝐸0, 𝑂0). Given deterministic update function ℎ(), the generative process for each step 𝑡 is defined as: 𝐴𝑖 𝑃𝜋,𝒯 (𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1), 𝑂𝑖 𝑃 (𝐴𝑖, 𝐸𝑖), 𝐸𝑖 = ℎ(𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1, 𝐴𝑖). To express this trajectory with simple mathematical representation, we introduce dynamic Bayesian network (Murphy, 2002) in Figure 2. With this graphical model, dependency structures of 𝐴, 𝐸, and 𝑂 can be explained as follows: (1) since the environment state 𝐸𝑖1 contains the entire conversation history of 𝐴𝑖1 and 𝑂<𝑖1 up to the 𝑖 1 step1, the current action 𝐴𝑖 depends only on 𝐸𝑖1 and 𝑂𝑖1; (2) the current observation 𝑂𝑖 from the environment also depends only on 𝐴𝑖 and 𝐸𝑖; (3) the transition of the environment state (𝐸𝑖1 𝐸𝑖) can be defined as deterministic function2 ℎ() which stacks the conversation logs up in memory module and conducts rule-based modification (write, update, or delete) on previous system state given the current action. Under this Bayesian network, the joint probability for the trajectory can be factorized as below, 𝑃 (ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑃 (𝐸0, 𝑂0)Π𝑇 = 𝑃 (𝐸0, 𝑂0)Π𝑇 𝑖=1𝑃 (ℱ𝑖ℱ𝑖1) 𝑖=1𝑃𝜋,𝒯 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1)𝑃 (𝑂𝑖𝐴𝑖, 𝐸𝑖), 1An adaptive memory structure (Xiong et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025a) can replace this ever-growing memory. 2In general, this system transition can be also stochastic, but we consider simplified yet still realistic scenario. 4 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents where ℱ0 = (𝐸0, 𝑂0), and 𝑃 (𝐸𝑖) = 1 as it is determistic. Now, we define the UQ problem for this stochastic agent system as follows. Definition 2 (Agent UQ). Let 𝑈 (𝑋) 0 be an uncertainty function that takes random variable 𝑋 or its distribution to produce non-negative real value. Given 𝑇 -turn trajectory, agent UQ aims to estimate both turn-level uncertainty 𝑈 (ℱ𝑡ℱ𝑡1) for 𝑡 = 1, ..., 𝑇 and trajectory-level uncertainty 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑈 (ℱ0, ..., ℱ𝑇 ), as joint total uncertainty. In the machine learning field, the most popular choices of the uncertainty function 𝑈 (𝑋) are Shannon entropy (Shannon, 1948) E[ log 𝑃 (𝑋)], negative log probability log 𝑃 (𝑋 = 𝑥), and their variants. These information-theoretic measures of uncertainty have nice property, chain-rule (Cover, 1999), making them suit for sequential modeling. For example, given 𝑈 (ℱ𝑡) := E[ log 𝑃 (ℱ𝑡)], we have the following uncertainty expansion, allowing us to model the agents total uncertainty as simple arithmetic of component-level uncertainties 3: 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑈 (𝐸0, 𝑂0) + = 𝑈 (𝐸0, 𝑂0) + 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝑈 (ℱ𝑖ℱ𝑖1) [𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1) + 𝑈 (𝑂𝑖𝐴𝑖, 𝐸𝑖)], where 𝑈 (𝐸0, 𝑂0) = 𝑈 (𝑂0𝐸0) + 𝑈 (𝐸0) denotes an initial query uncertainty plus task volatility. Desideratum. While previous LLM UQ setups usually focus on conditional uncertainty of final answer, agent UQ aims at estimating joint uncertainty over the full trajectory, where the estimate from calibrated agent should be predictive of the reward on that trajectory. Formally, for all 𝑟1 > 𝑟2, E[𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 )𝑟(ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑟1 ] < E[𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 )𝑟(ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑟2 ], (1) where 𝑟() denotes real-value reward function commonly set as success-failure binary annotator. We draw analogies between agent UQ and probabilistic Turing machines (Gill III, 1974), as well as belief tracking in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Kaelbling et al., 1998), highlighting that agent UQ is grounded while still having its unique edge in contrast to these existing theoretical models in terms of setups and focus. See Appendix for discussion. 3.2. Unified View on Existing UQ Setups We now show that our agent UQ formulation captures various existing UQs as special cases. Reduction to single-step LLM UQ. When 𝑡 = 1 and the action space is restricted to responses, LLM UQ can be cast as special case 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑈 (𝑂0) + 𝑈 (𝐴1𝑂0) 𝑈 (𝐴1𝑂0), where 𝑂0 and 𝐴1 denote the given question and the corresponding model answer, respectively. Most current LLM UQ literature addresses only the conditional answer uncertainty 𝑈 (𝐴1𝑂0) (Fadeeva et al., 2023; Farquhar et al., 2024; Malinin and Gales, 2021). few also consider the question ambiguity 𝑈 (𝑂0) (Hou et al., 2024; Tomov et al., 2025) to reflect the reality of wild user query (Min et al., 2020). 3See Appendix and for derivation and alternative measures, e.g., informational energy (Pardo and Taneja, 1991) and nonextensive entropy (Gell-Mann and Tsallis, 2004). 5 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents Reduction to multi-step reasoning UQ. When the action space involves multi-step reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought, Wei et al. (2022)), we have 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑈 (𝑂0) + 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐴<𝑖, 𝑂0) 𝑇 𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐴<𝑖, 𝑂0) 𝑖=1 max 𝑖{1,...,𝑇 } 𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐴<𝑖, 𝑂0) 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝑤𝑖𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐴<𝑖, 𝑂0), (2) (3) (4) (5) where 𝑤𝑖 0 and 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝑤𝑖 = 1. Here, 𝑂0 and 𝐴𝑇 denote the given initial query and the models final response, and 𝐴𝑖, ..., 𝐴𝑇 1 are intermediate outputs. Similar to the single-step setup, most existing multistep UQs (Tanneru et al., 2024; Tao et al., 2025) do not consider the question ambiguity 𝑈 (𝑂0), so that reduces Eq. 2 to Eq. 3, while few consider it (Leang et al., 2025). Meanwhile, rather than summing up all the step-wise uncertainties, some approaches consider the most uncertain one, i.e., the lowest confidence used in Fu et al. (2025), which can be represented by Eq. 4. Finally, Eq. 5 expresses various weighted average methods, such as standard length-normalized uncertainty (Kang et al., 2025b) by setting 𝑤𝑖 = 1 , and tail 𝑇 confidence (Fu et al., 2025) by setting 𝑤𝑇 = 1, and other clever weighting strategies, i.e., top-K mean (Fu et al., 2025) or model-based estimates (Zhao et al., 2025). Connection to process reward modeling. We further draw connection between this trajectory-level UQ problem and the process reward modeling problem (Li and Li, 2025; Lightman et al., 2024; Uesato et al., 2022) where we assign credit (reward) for each intermediate reasoning step, and then it can be utilized to evaluate the reasoning trajectory by aggregating the rewards across steps to derive trajectory-level reward. For example, Lightman et al. (2024) proposed the product of the step-wise probabilities and the minimum probability between steps as the aggregation method. These are analogs to Eq. 3 and Eq. 4, respectively. 𝑇 From this unified view, we see that they all model the multi-step Limitation of existing frameworks. uncertainty as uni-directional propagation, i.e., every step-level uncertainty positively contributes to the total uncertainty, without distinguishing action types at each turn. One might claim that the average uncertainty 1 𝑡=1 𝑈 (ℱ𝑡ℱ𝑡1) can already be fine, as it might produce lower value for the chain of 𝑇 certain actions and vice versa. However, it does not consider the type of action which is critical in agentic setups, where an agents interactivity is key to earning reward. See Fig. 3 (a), scenario wherein user does not fully specify their goal upfront. After searching for options, the agent either reasons itself or interacts with the user to delegate decisions. Although both trajectories are evidential, interaction-oriented ones tend to achieve higher rewards, despite reasoning-oriented ones often yielding greater confidence. Yet, existing methods can produce misleading uncertainty estimates, fail to meet the desiderata (Eq 1). 4. How to Model Uncertainty Dynamics of Interactive Agents? 4.1. Unique Challenge In contrast to the LLM UQ, agent UQ spans multi-turn trajectory in an open environment. This presents unique challenge: modeling cascade uncertainty in an interactive system. Here, the desired UQ method should be able to precisely aggregate uncertainties across the entire trajectory and account for additional Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents Figure 3 Limitation of existing UQ (a) and our suggestion (b). Prior works just concern the evidentiality when designing or evaluating UQ while neglecting interactivity, so they may fail to reliably capture the agents failure. We urge expanding dimension of interest, interactivity, and moving on to reducible uncertainty modeling of agents. information gained through interactions. While there is emerging research on step-wise uncertainty aggregation (Fu et al., 2025; Kang et al., 2025b), they examine an isolated, noninteractive setting where an agent does not receive any external feedback during inference (e.g., Fig. 1, b). Meanwhile, agent UQ considers setup full of interactions with user and an environment, making it non-isolated, interactive system. Since an agent in this open world can gather additional information, make clarifications, and request confirmations at each step by interacting with the user and external databases through conversations and tool calls, the uncertainty dynamics in this interactive system includes not only propagations of turnlevel uncertainty, but also reductions. As shown in Fig. 3, the existing perspective does not consider interactivity in agent UQ and prohibits reducible uncertainty modeling. In this paper, we argue that we must introduce interactivity in agent UQ to model bi-directional uncertainty flow. 4.2. Agent UQ as Conditional Uncertainty Reduction Process We need new perspective to model an agents uncertainty dynamics that accounts for both reductions and increases, depending on the agents interactivity at each step. While there are multiple ways to realize this concept, we propose one possible implementation as prototype: information gating, which goes hand in hand with the information-theoretic measure of uncertainty noted in Sec. 3. Specifically, we derive lower bound of total uncertainty 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) that admits selective reduction or increase in uncertainty throughout the trajectory: 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑈 (𝐸0, 𝑂0) + 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝑈 (ℱ𝑖ℱ𝑖1) = 𝑈 (𝐸0, 𝑂0) + = 𝑈 (𝐸0, 𝑂0) + 𝑈 (𝐸0, 𝑂0) + 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝑇 𝑖= 𝑇 𝑖=1 [𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1) + 𝑈 (𝑂𝑖𝐴𝑖, 𝐸𝑖)] 𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1)[1 + 𝑈 (𝑂𝑖𝐴𝑖, 𝐸𝑖) 𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1) ] 𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1)𝑔(ℱ𝑖). (6) 7 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents Figure 4 Illustration on the proposed agent UQ paradigm. We propose the conditional uncertainty reduction process for LLM agents by discerning interactive and evidential actions from others. Here, we introduce conditional gating function 𝑔() that reduces or increases current turn uncertainty depending on the action. That is, for set of valid uncertainty reduction actions, 𝒜, we define: 𝑔(ℱ𝑖) = { Info(𝑂𝑖;𝑂0𝐸𝑖𝑂0) 𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1,𝑂𝑖1) 1 + 𝑈 (𝑂𝑖𝐴𝑖,𝐸𝑖) 𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1,𝑂𝑖1) if 𝐴𝑖 𝒜, otherwise. where Info(; ) denotes mutual information or pointwise mutual information that measures the amount of information gain by having the current observation 𝑂𝑖 w.r.t. initial query 𝑂0 given conversation history 𝐸𝑖𝑂0. For each turn, if the agents action is classified as an interactive (inviting user or tool) and evidential one (factual or not in conflict with stored data), then 𝑔() produces the amount of information gain with negative sign to realize uncertainty reduction; otherwise, it propagates uncertainty (See Fig. 4). Importantly, the signed gating function handles uncertainty in more interpretable manner than traditional estimates by letting not only quantitative but also directional interpretations. Besides, this uncertainty model allows us to derive the analytic extrema, i.e., maximum and minimum, of total uncertainty in closed forms as shown in Lemma 1. Lemma 1 (Extrema of Information Gating). Let the lower bound of agent total uncertainty in Eq. 6 be 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ), denote 𝑈 (𝑋) := 𝐻(𝑋) = E[ log 𝑃 (𝑋)] and Info(𝑋; 𝑌 ) := 𝐼(𝑋; 𝑌 ) = E[log 𝑃 (𝑋,𝑌 ) 𝑃 (𝑋)𝑃 (𝑌 ) ], then, we have: 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) 𝐻(𝐸0, 𝑂0) 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) 𝐻(𝐸0, 𝑂0) + 𝑇 1 𝑖=1 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝐼(𝑂𝑖, 𝑂0𝐸𝑖𝑂0) + 𝐻(𝐴𝑇 𝐸𝑇 1, 𝑂𝑇 1), 𝐻(𝐴𝑖, 𝑂𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1). Proof. If 𝐴𝑖 𝒜 (resp. 𝐴𝑖 / 𝒜) for all 1 𝑖 𝑇 1, then 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) becomes monotonic uncertainty reduction (resp. propagation) process, deriving above inequalities (See Appendix for details). Interpretation. Lemma 1 states that an agents total uncertainty can be expressed as an ever-decreasing process starting from task-specific initial uncertainty reduced by the amount of extra information delivered by current observation, given the previous trajectory till its final behavior in the ideal case; whereas it is continually stacked up by the amount of joint entropy between action and observation per turn in worst case. Together with the directional interpretation turn-level uncertainty (increase or decrease), these analytic extrema help us better understand the numerical uncertainty, which is usually hard to interpret (Belém et al., 2024; Kirchhof et al., 2025a; Van Der Bles et al., 2019). Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents Action Category Interactivity Example Informationgathering interactive Agent uses read tool (e.g., get_reservation_details or search_flights) to retrieve data or asks the user for missing information, e.g., Could you provide your reservation number and last name?. interactive Agent asks the user preferences or confirmation on decision, such as, Do you want me to proceed with booking FQ8APE?. Asking clarification or confirmation to user Thinking State-changing tool call (writing) noninteractive noninteractive Providing final information to user noninteractive Agent plans the future action sequence based on the previous trajectory. Agent calls the tools that modify the database (e.g., cancel_reservation, book_reservation, update_reservation_flights) commit to an outcome. Agent reports the result of an action, such as Your reservation has been cancelled; your refund will be processed or Your flight has been rebooked to SFO departing at 8 a.m.. Table 1 Example action classes in Airline booking scenario in 𝜏 -bench. number of the agents actions can be categorized into five classes, which may reduce or increase the total uncertainty. See Appendix for extended analyses. Sketch of implementation. To operationalize this idea, we first need an action classifier to determine whether 𝐴𝑖 𝒜 or not. One can adopt model-based evaluator (Kim et al., 2025) and rule-based verifier (Zeng et al., 2025) to assess the interactivity and evidentiality of actions, respectively, where 𝐴𝑖 𝒜 if and only if 𝐴𝑖 is both evidential and interactive. An example categorization of actions in an airline assistant task is provided in Table 1. After that, four different quantities need to be estimated: (1) initial query uncertainty, (2) action uncertainty, (3) observation uncertainty, and (4) mutual information between the query and observation given the previous trajectory. For these estimations, we can leverage the output probability (Aichberger et al., 2024; Malinin and Gales, 2021), consistency in multiple trials (Farquhar et al., 2024), world modeling (Anonymous, 2026; Chae et al., 2025), and learning neural estimator (Gritsai et al., 2025; Molavipour et al., 2020). We leave the actual implementation for future work. See Appendix for additional notes. 5. Practical Implications Developing an agent UQ framework is not merely theoretical exercise but prerequisite for deploying LLM agents in non-deterministic real environments. We outline implications for frontier LLM research and three specialized domains: healthcare, coding, and robotics, in which agent UQ may have profound downstream effects, thereby incentivizing policymakers, practitioners, and researchers. 5.1. Advancing Frontier LLMs Test-time scaling through reasoning is now de facto standard technique to enhance the quality of LLM responses on challenging tasks (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2022). However, there is still huge room for improvement, e.g., mitigating overthinking and/or pursuing efficiency (Aggarwal et al., 2025; Sui et al., 2025). Agent UQ provides concrete guidance to develop an adaptive reasoning method, i.e., early stopping 9 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents or interaction invoking, via uncertainty budgeting. In addition, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as promising yet challenging research theme in eliciting the agentic behavior and reasoning of LLMs (Shani et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024). Agent UQ helps tackle the main bottlenecks, credit assignment and when-to-explore problems (Choudhury, 2025; Pecka and Svoboda, 2014; Thrun, 1992), limited positive feedback (Lee et al., 2025, 2026), and inspires an information pursuit policy (Chattopadhyay et al., 2022) by leveraging directional and quantitative uncertainty information as feedback. 5.2. Reliable Clinical Decision Supporting Agents Modern LLM agents offer promising vision for healthcare, moving beyond static knowledge retrieval to autonomous systems with complex reasoning and tool-execution capabilities (Wang et al., 2025c). However, the transition from promising prototypes to reliable clinical agents faces critical obstacles stemming from the systems inability to recognize and manage its own limitations. We believe that agent UQ can fill this gap. For example, although Ferber et al. (2025) observed huge potential of tool-calling LLM agents in oncology diagnoses, the remaining error rate underscores the necessity of human-in-the-loop workflow. Here, agent UQ can serve as gatekeeper, e.g., flagging highly accumulated uncertainty moments to invite humans, automating during low-uncertainty periods, while pursuing total uncertainty reduction for the right final diagnosis. This aligns with the concept: adaptive healthcare that envisions paradigm shift from passive prediction to active, risk-aware inquiry (Hinostroza Fuentes et al., 2025). 5.3. Reliable Software Engineering Agents Although advanced coding agents (Anthropic, 2025; OpenAI, 2025) have pushed performance on standard benchmarks (Jimenez et al., 2024) to an impressive degree, the disparity between passing controlled test and safely modifying production-level codebase stresses the urgent need for an agent UQ framework. Agent UQ enables more controllable exploration and commitment mechanism, wherein the agentic system knows uncertainty over bug patch candidates and decides whether to gather more evidence, e.g., check more files, or commit to fix. Besides, considering uncertainty-triggered rollback and branching algorithm, in which an agent treats increasing uncertainty after an action as signal to revert or branch by mirroring the checkpoint-rollback workflows of human engineers. These highlight the potential of UQ for reliable agentic coders. 5.4. Relible Embodied Agents in Cyber-Physical Systems Embodied agents in cyber-physical systems face heterogeneous uncertainty from sensing, dynamics, and human intent (Fung et al., 2025; Gemini Robotics, 2025; Li et al., 2024), and they actively reduce uncertainty through interaction by re-sensing the environment or interacting with humans before committing to irreversible physical actions (Xu et al., 2025b). For example, robot instructed to retrieve fragile object may explore or seek clarification rather than execute grasp under high uncertainty. This makes embodied autonomy canonical instance of conditional uncertainty reduction process, where information-gathering actions reduce uncertainty and state-changing actions increase commitment and risk. By explicitly quantifying and managing this uncertainty dynamic, our agent UQ solution offers safer action selection (Zhang et al., 2025a), principled deferral (Hagenow and Shah, 2025), and robust execution (Römer et al., 2025). 6. Open Problems Although we have so far presented conceptual roadmap and the practical implications of agent UQ, significant open problems remain as follows. 10 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents Developing rigid benchmarks at scale. As in the case of process reward modeling mentioned in Section 3.2, annotating across long-horizon trajectories introduces non-trivial efforts and costs (Choudhury, 2025). Moreover, as true uncertainty is unmeasurable, i.e., only proxy-based evaluation is possible, establishing benchmarks for agent UQ stands on the next level of difficulty than the static LLM evaluation (Ielanskyi et al., 2025). Investigation on defining proper agent performance measures (Hendrycks et al., 2025; Kapoor et al., 2025) with scalable evaluation and annotation methods for agent rollouts (Chang et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024) would be crucial stepping stone. Long-horizon black-box uncertainty estimation. LLM agents are mostly offered by proprietary services, where we cannot access the output probability of the agent. While model owners and providers can leverage low-cost white-box UQ approaches, others may have to rely on expensive black-box UQ that requires heavy sampling per action over long trajectory (Zhang et al., 2024). This poses great challenge for low-resource users in developing UQ with state-of-the-art agents. Is high uncertainty per step due to the agents lack of knowledge about the right Solution multiplicity. action for that step? Or, is it due to the intrinsic multiplicity of valid actions in that step? We cannot identify which of them is the right source of high uncertainty! Besides, in contrast to the classic question answering, the task bid to an agent is too complex to be perfectly specified at once. Thus, each intermediate step is intrinsically ambiguous and allows multiple valid actions, making it impossible to specify the source of the high uncertainty. UQ in multi-agent or self-evolving agent systems. While we confine our setup to single-agent, nonevolving agent systems, there has been remarkable advancement in multi-agent systems (Guo et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024) and self-evolving agents (Jiang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024a). Modeling the joint uncertainty dynamics of multiple agents or considering the non-stationary toolkit and agent parameters over time brings extra challenges that may require deliberation and other formal toolkits (Cheng et al., 2021; Jø sang, 2016; Tsallis and Brigatti, 2004). 7. Conclusion We argue that LLM UQ research should move towards more realistic setup, i.e., agentic inference, featuring the interactive long-horizon task episode, which requires paradigm shift from point-wise estimate to the bi-directional dynamics model of uncertainty. We laid the foundation for this by providing concrete definition and general formulation of agent UQ that abstracts wide variety of existing UQ approaches. To tackle the limitations of existing framing, we presented novel perspective, conditional uncertainty reduction process, with actionable guidelines and theoretical analysis. As concluding remark, we quote Schrödingers note on living in physics (Schrödinger, 1974): Every living means an increase in entropy of the part of the world, and it can only survive by continually drawing negative entropy from its environment."

However, agentic systems in the wild may encounter unreliable (even adversarial; Kang et al. (2025a)) observations and stochastically evolving environment, where our current proposal does not ensure its effectiveness. In that scenario, we may 11 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents need to explicitly model uncertainty in the agents evidence stream as well, e.g., trust/ignorance about tool outputs, retrieval, and user-provided facts, by leveraging formalisms, such as subjective logic (Cheng et al., 2020a; Jsang, 2018), imprecise probability theory (Walley, 1991), and formal belief representation (Genin and Huber, 2022), to safely manage memory and act under unreliable observations in stochastic world."

We believe that the realization of our proposed framework can significantly boost the reliability of the LLM agent in dynamic, interactive inference setup, thereby facilitating risk mitigation in high-stakes decision-making. However, we also acknowledge that the proposed framework can be misused by allowing adversaries to efficiently steer the agent towards its blind spots or manipulate uncertainty thresholds to bypass safety filters (Wang et al., 2025d). Therefore, we recommend alleviations such as limiting exposure to attack-enabling signals, red-teaming, and monitoring for abuse, which avoid overpromising what low uncertainty implies."

Additional Details on Formulation A.1. Expression of various agentic prompting methods under our formulation. In Section 3.1, we have introduced definition of stochastic agent system (Def. 1) with probabilistic graphical model of specific conditional dependency assumptions 2. Under this model, we can abstract some representative agentic prompting methods (Ahn et al., 2022; Patil et al., 2025; Shinn et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022) with unified language yet distinctive conditions as below. 1. Vanilla function calling (Patil et al., 2025): Same as Definition 1. Stochastic process of (𝐴𝑡, 𝐸𝑡, 𝑂𝑡) without any extra conditions. 2. Few-shot prompting (Ahn et al., 2022): Just augmenting initial task-specification variable as 𝐸 0 = , which may implicitly affect 𝐸0 {ℱ (𝑖)}𝑁 the action transition probability, 𝑃𝜋,𝒯 (), by conditioning. with some example rollouts ℱ (𝑖) = {(𝐴𝑡, 𝐸𝑡, 𝑂𝑡)}𝑇 𝑖 𝑡= 𝑖=1 3. ReAct (Wang et al., 2024b; Yao et al., 2022): Adding constraint on the action sampling as 𝐴𝑖 𝑃𝜋,𝒯 (𝐴thk𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1) if 𝐴𝑖1 𝒜thk else 𝐴𝑖 𝑃𝜋,𝒯 (𝐴thk𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1), where 𝐴thk 𝒜thk and 𝐴thk 𝒜thk randon varaibles from the partitions of 𝒜 standing for the space of textual reasoning and all others, respectively. 4. Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023): Do multiple trials ℱ (𝑖) = {ℱ (1), ..., ℱ (𝑖)} until 𝑟(𝑖) := 𝑟(ℱ (𝑖)) = 1 or reach maximum trials, otherwise augmenting the per-trial initial state with an external long-term memory 𝐸(𝑖+1) 0 {ℳ(ℱ (𝑗), 𝑟(𝑗))}𝑗𝑖, where the long-term memory ℳ() constructs with textual feedback generated from an LLM prompted by the current trial trajectory and corresponding binary reward. Thus, the action transition probability, 𝑃𝜋,𝒯 (), is continually evolved by reflecting feedback from historical runs. = 𝐸(𝑖) 0 Overall, this suggests that our agent formulation is general and flexible enough to capture broad class of representative agentic prompting scenarios. A.2. Uncertainty Instantiations and Total Uncertainty Expansion. After defining the agent UQ in Def 2, we presented trajectory-level total uncertainty that expresses the joint uncertainty across multiple turns in an additive form of the initial query uncertainty, action uncertainty, and observation uncertainty. 23 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents Given the joint probability, 𝑃 (ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑃 (𝐸0, 𝑂0)Π𝑇 𝑖=1𝑃𝜋,𝒯 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1)𝑃 (𝑂𝑖𝐴𝑖, 𝐸𝑖),, we enumerate three example instances of the uncertainty measure 𝑈 () that induces the simple additive form of total uncertainty: 1. Information content (negative log probability), 𝑈 (𝑋 = 𝑥) := log 𝑃 (𝑋 = 𝑥), to measure pointwise surprisal for given observation. 2. Entropy, 𝑈 (𝑋) := 𝐻(𝑋) = E[ log 𝑃 (𝑋)], to measure the expected amount of surprisal. 3. Relative entropy, 𝑈 (𝑋) := DKL (𝑄(𝑋)𝑃 (𝑋)) with pre-defined reference distribution 𝑄(𝑋) and Kullback-Leibler divergence DKL, to measure the expected amount of surprisal given prior knowledge (if we have any). For information content, it is trivial to show by just taking the negative logarithm to 𝑃 (ℱ𝑇 ). For the entropy and relative entropy, we have the following chain rule (Cover, 1999), 𝐻(ℱ0, ..., ℱ𝑇 ) = 𝑇 DKL 𝑖=0 𝐻(ℱ𝑖ℱ𝑖1, ..., ℱ1), (𝑄(ℱ0, ..., ℱ𝑇 )𝑃 (ℱ0, ..., ℱ𝑇 )) = 𝑇 𝑖=0 DKL (𝑄(ℱ𝑖ℱ𝑖1, ..., ℱ1)𝑃 (ℱ𝑖ℱ𝑖1, ..., ℱ1)), which directly drives our uncertainty expansion for 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) in Section 3.1. B. Alternative Uncertainty Measures Although we have mainly focused on the above three information-theoretic uncertainty measures throughout the paper, there are plenty of alternatives one can consider depending on the problem setups. In this section, we examine some possible alternative uncertainty measures, Rényi entropy, Tsallis entropy, and informational energy. Rényi entropy (Rényi, 1961) has been widely applied in modern machine learning, ecology, biodiversity science, and quantum information, among other fields. Given an order parameter 0 < 𝛼 < and 𝛼 = 𝑥𝒳 𝑃 (𝑥)𝛼) and generalize many other entropies: max-entropy 1, it is defined as 𝐻𝛼(𝑋) = 1 𝐻0(𝑋) = log 𝒳 , Shannon entropy lim𝛼1 𝐻𝛼(𝑋) = 𝑥𝒳 𝑃 (𝑥) log 𝑃 (𝑥), collision entropy 𝐻2(𝑋) = log 𝑥𝒳 𝑃 (𝑥)2, and min-entropy 𝐻(𝑋) . = min𝑥𝒳 log 𝑃 (𝑥). 1𝛼 log( extends this further to model complex system where the additivity Tsallis entropy (Tsallis, 1988) property of Shannon and Rényi entropies for independent subsystems does not hold. Given an index parameter 𝑞 R{1}, it is defined as 𝐻𝑞(𝑋) = 1 𝑥𝒳 𝑃 (𝑥)𝑞 , which recover Shannon entropy when 𝑞 1. 𝑞1 Along with Rényi entropy, Tsallis entropy has taken key role in characterizing complex physical systems as nonextensive measure of entropy (Tsallis and Brigatti, 2004). is another Onicescu informational energy (Calin and Udrişte, 2014; Pardo and Taneja, 1991) popular measure of (un)certainty that has bred many applications in quantum mechanics, economics, ecology, social sciences, and so on. It is defined as IE(X) := x𝒳 P(x)2 which can be connected to Rényi entropy of order-2 𝐻2(𝑋) = log 𝑥𝒳 𝑃 (𝑥)2 = log IE(X), as well as the power entropy (Vajda, 1968; Vajda and Zvárová, 2007) 𝑉2(𝑋) = 1 𝑥𝒳 𝑃 (𝑥)2 = 1 IE(X). There is also concept, Onicescus , to quantify the dependency correlation coefficient (Calin and Udrişte, 2014), 𝜌(𝑋, 𝑌 ) = structure between multiple variables. 𝑥,𝑦 𝑃 (𝑥)𝑃 (𝑦) IE(X)IE(Y) 24 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents These sophisticated measures may be worth investigating for the LLM agents inference interface, characterized by long-range interactions, evolving memory, and the multifractal property. C. Extended Context Connection to the probabilistic Turing machines. At some level of abstraction, one can view the LLM agents as probabilistic interactive Turing machines (PITMs) (Gill, 1977) that induce distribution over action-observation transcripts. This connection may allow us to borrow some possible formal tools from the PITM literature to design UQ method for LLM agents. However, we note the following distinctions: (1) PITMs have an explicit randomness source and defined distribution, whereas LLM agent also has procedural uncertainty induced by the decoding time strategies; (2) while PITMs interact via fixed channels, LLM agents commonly interact with users and tools in partially observable or changing formats; and (3) the goal of LLM agents are often underspecified upfront and can be negotiated over turns depending on the situation, though PITMs have concrete accept/output condition. Connection to the partially observable Markov decision process. One might draw an analogy between the agent UQ and belief tracking in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) (Kaelbling et al., 1998). However, the agent theme challenges the standard setups in traditional POMDPs: (1) there is no explicit belief state, but the agent carries an implicit belief in its memory; (2) actions and observations comprise language and structured strings, spanning an effectively infinite spacefar from the small discrete spaces in classical POMDP; and (3) it concerns more on the agents uncertainty, whereas POMDP concerns mostly on environment uncertainty. These connections highlight the distinctive edge of agent UQ, while grounding it in well-established classical problem set. D. Note on Implementation While we set our goal to provide principled vision with high-level roadmap for agent UQ, we also discuss some implementation recipes in this section to provide useful guidance for practitioners and researchers. Action classifier. To realize the conditional information gate, we first need to classify actions to determine whether each action will contribute to total uncertainty reduction for that task or not. As emphasized in Section 3, considering the interactivity of actions is key to accounting for agent uncertainty dynamics, as well as the evidentiality (or factuality) of the action that is solely considered for the existing approaches so far. Therefore, we may want to implement compound classifier with both interactivity assessment and evidentiality verification. They can be implemented through rule/syntactic-based, simple verifier (Mu et al., 2024), an LLM judge with specialized prompting, fine-tuning (Liu et al., 2025), or hybrid of rule-based and LLM-based (Peng et al., 2025). In our proposed total uncertainty lower bound Eq. 6, there are three uncertainty Uncertainty estimation. terms, including initial query uncertainty, action uncertainty, and observation uncertainty. The action uncertainty can be estimated or approximated by leveraging existing techniques, such as sampling-based ones entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023; Malinin and Gales, 2021), pure probability-based methods (Duan et al., 2024; Fomicheva et al., 2020), hybrid (Vashurin et al., 2025), or the conformal prediction set size (Kumar et al., 2023). 25 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents Action Category Interactivity Informationgathering Asking clarification or confirmation to user Thinking State-changing tool call (write) Providing final information to user interactive interactive noninteractive noninteractive noninteractive Scenario-specific Example Search flight information (𝜏 -bench Airline); retrieve order status (𝜏 -bench Retail); read message box (ToolSandbox) Ask for flight choice or request final booking decision (𝜏 -bench Airline); instruct or ask the user to choose cancellation (𝜏 -bench Retail); ask for providing contact information or request updating contact number (ToolSandbox) Plan flight schedule (𝜏 -bench Airline); consider returning items (𝜏 -bench Retail); think the reason of failed temperature checking (ToolSandbox) Update flight booking (𝜏 -bench Airline); return/cancel items (𝜏 -bench Retail); Turn on Wifi (ToolSandbox) Summarize updated flights (𝜏 -bench Airline); summarize returned items (𝜏 -bench Retail); summarize phonebook update results (ToolSandbox) Table 2 Example action classes in three scenarios from two benchmarks, 𝜏 -bench (Barres et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2024) and ToolSandbox (Lu et al., 2025). However, the observation uncertainty and the initial query uncertainty will be much harder to estimate, as we usually do not have full knowledge of the world. If the system allows multiple trials, one can utilize sampling-consistency-based approach to estimate the observation uncertainty, likewise the traditional black-box UQ methods. If the system does not allow this, one may try to construct datastore that contains some relevant data from similar task and leverage nonparameter estimation methods (Kotelevskii et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2023). Another line of methods can be establishing world model to approximate the environment transition and estimate observation uncertainty from it (Anonymous, 2026; Chae et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025a). Mutual information estimation. The proposed information gating mechanism features the information reduction based on the amount of information gain by measuring the conditional mutual information between the current observation 𝑂𝑖 and initial query 𝑂0, given all previous conversations except the initial query 𝐸𝑖𝑂0. While the estimation of mutual information is notorious for its difficulty, recent advancements on neural estimators (Belghazi et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2020b; Gritsai et al., 2025; Molavipour et al., 2020; Mukherjee et al., 2020) shed light on this problem by enabling estimation in high-dimensional, unstructured data space. Conditional certainty maximization process. As an analogy to the conditional uncertainty reduction process presented in Section 4.2, we can also envision certainty maximization approach by replacing the uncertainty with certainty measure, such as informational energy (Pardo and Taneja, 1991), mentioned in Appendix B. Given that Onicescus informational energy brings its correlation coefficient as well, we may be able to implement the exact same style information-gating-based method that has the opposite direction to uncertainty reduction dynamics. 26 Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents E. Action Categorization Along with the flight booking scenario in Table 1, we extend our action category analysis to two more scenarios, retail and telecommunication tasks, from 𝜏 -bench (Barres et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2024) and ToolSandbox (Lu et al., 2025) in Table 2.

Let the lower bound of agent total uncertainty in Eq. 6 be 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ), denote 𝑈 (𝑋) := 𝐻(𝑋) = E[ log 𝑃 (𝑋)] and Info(𝑋; 𝑌 ) := 𝐼(𝑋; 𝑌 ) = E[log 𝑃 (𝑋,𝑌 ) 𝑃 (𝑋)𝑃 (𝑌 ) ], then, we have: 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) 𝐻(𝐸0, 𝑂0) 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) 𝐻(𝐸0, 𝑂0) + 𝑇 1 𝑖=1 𝑇 𝑖=1 𝐼(𝑂𝑖, 𝑂0𝐸𝑖𝑂0) + 𝐻(𝐴𝑇 𝐸𝑇 1, 𝑂𝑇 1), 𝐻(𝐴𝑖, 𝑂𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1). Proof. For 𝑖, if 𝐴𝑖 𝒜 (resp. 𝐴𝑖 / 𝒜), turn-level uncertainty 𝑈 (ℱ𝑖) becomes 𝐼(𝑂𝑖, 𝑂0𝐸𝑖𝑂0) (resp. 𝑈 (ℱ𝑖) = 𝑈 (𝐴𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1) + 𝑈 (𝑂𝑖𝐴𝑖, 𝐸𝑖) = 𝐻(𝐴𝑖, 𝑂𝑖𝐸𝑖1, 𝑂𝑖1)). Thus, if all the intermediate actions are interactive and evidential, e.g., 𝐴𝑖 𝒜 for all 1 𝑖 𝑇 1 (resp. 𝐴𝑖 / 𝒜 for all 1 𝑖 𝑇 1), our total uncertainty lower bound 𝑈 (ℱ𝑇 ) becomes monotonic uncertainty reduction process (resp. monotonic propagation process), deriving the above two inequalities. Here, the final termination-turn action should not be interactive, and the observation in this turn is deterministic in our considered setups  (Fig. 2)  , resulting in the accumulation of last action uncertainty 𝐻(𝐴𝑇 𝐸𝑇 1, 𝑂𝑇 1). G. Discussion and Future Work Does solely establishing the agent UQ framework actually help us to reliably infer on the agents performance on task? Modern LLMs (especially after post-training) are not well-calibrated (Tian et al., 2023), so the uncertainty estimates from these ill-calibrated probabilistic models can not be directly used as reliable performance indicator. Although we present high-level roadmap for quantifying uncertainty for LLM agent systems, future work should also explore the calibration of LLM agents as well. The connection between calibration and accuracy (Oh et al., 2024; Park et al., 2020) of predictor shows an exciting future work direction for joint optimization of the agents problem-solving capability and calibration simultaneously. Another promising direction for future investigations would be to extend the agent UQ framework to multimodal setups such as graphical user interface agents (Nguyen et al., 2025), where extra challenges occur, such as many-to-many correspondence between modalities (Chun, 2025). Defining and establishing reliable UQ framework for multimodal agents would offer helpful foundations to develop robustness solutions (Oh et al., 2025a,b), safety (Chen et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025b) and more (Shi et al., 2025)."
