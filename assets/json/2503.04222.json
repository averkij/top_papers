            "content": "Combining the strengths of multiple large language models (LLMs) provides powerful means to enhance performance, robustness, and generalization across diverse tasks by leveraging the unique expertise and knowledge each model offers. Individual LLMs, particularly those constrained by size or training data, may perform well in specific areas but struggle in others due to specialization gaps. For instance, one model might excel at generating creative content but lack precision in technical explanations, while another delivers technical accuracy but struggles with conversational fluency. By integrating multiple models, their collective strengths can bridge these gaps, leading to improved overall performance. This collaborative approach also improves robustness, as the system can compensate for individual model errorswhen one model underperforms, others can intervene to support the response. Furthermore, this integration enhances task generalization by exposing the system to diverse patterns, allowing it to adapt more effectively to new or unseen challenges. Various strategies have been developed to achieve this, each with unique trade-offs. Ensemble methods (Jiang et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2025) enhance performance and robustness by combining predictions from multiple models. However, they require all models to remain active during inference, leading to substantial computational and memory costs. LLM routing (Ding et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024; Ong et al., 2025) offers more efficient alternative: router selects the most appropriate LLM to handle each query. While this balances effectiveness and efficiency, it requires training new router for each task, limiting its generalization to unseen tasks. Model merging (Wortsman et al., 2022) integrates models with identical architectures into unified parameter set, improving robustness and generalization but limiting applicability to homogeneous model families. Explicit model fusion (EMF) methods (Wan et al., 2024a;b) use knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from multiple source models to single target model, often through probabilistic distribution matrices. While adaptable to different model structures and sizes, EMF faces challenges like vocabulary alignment and distribution merging, which can complicate the fusion process and introduce errors. In this paper, we present FuseChat-3.0, suite of large language models (LLMs) developed by harnessing the strengths of heterogeneous source LLMs into more compact target models. Our approach enables target LLMs to learn directly from the generated outputs of diverse open-source LLMsa process termed implicit model fusion (IMF) (Yang et al., 2025). IMF leverages the rich information embedded in outputs from stronger LLMs through various mechanisms. For example, these outputs can be used to fine-tune weaker models (Tian et al., 2024; Kang et al., 2024). In the domain of preference learning, methods like Zephyr (Tunstall et al., 2024) and Tülu 3 (Lambert et al., 2024) utilize GPT-4 to rank responses generated by multiple LLMs, thereby creating preference datasets for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training (Rafailov et al., 2023). Similarly, WRPO constructs preference pairs by combining responses from both target and source models. However, generating positive and negative examples from different models can introduce reward annotation bias and variance, potentially undermining optimization. In contrast, our method addresses these issues by constructing each preference pair from the best and worst responses generated by the same source model. This crucial distinction eliminates the reward bias caused by heterogeneous response styles, prevents reward hacking, and delivers more controlled preference signals. As illustrated in Figure 2, our IMF framework follows three-stage process. First, during the data construction stage, we generate multiple responses from various source models for each prompt. These responses are then evaluated using an external reward model for instruction-following tasks, while mathematics and coding responses are verified through rule-based methods. Next, we introduce supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to tackle the challenges posed by distribution shifts when applying preference learning directly to heterogeneous LLM outputs (Xu et al., 2024a; Tajwar et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). Specifically, this stage fine-tunes the target models using the optimal response from the source models for each prompt. Finally, building on the SFT initialization, the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) stage incorporates controlled preference signals from samesource response pairs to further fine-tune the target model. This structured approach enhances model robustness while reducing bias and variance caused by heterogeneous response data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FuseChat-3.0, we conduct experiments across diverse range of models and benchmarks. We utilize four prominent open-source LLMs, with parameter sizes ranging from 27B to 123B, as source models. For target models, we select five smaller, widely used models with sizes between 1B and 9B parameters. FuseChat-3.0 is evaluated on 14 well-established instruction-following, general knowledge, benchmarks spanning four core capability domains:"

            "content": "Collective LLMs With the prosperity of various open-source LLMs, it has become natural to explore ways to combine the strengths of these heterogeneous models to create more powerful systems. This section reviews existing approaches to combine heterogeneous LLMs, categorizing them into four main strategies: ensemble, routing, model merging, and model fusion methods. Ensemble methods enhance model performance by aggregating the outputs of multiple LLMs. LLMBlender (Jiang et al., 2023b) employs pairwise ranker to select the top-K outputs from various LLMs, which are then aggregated and refined by sequence-to-sequence blender model. Mixtureof-Agents (MoA) (Wang et al., 2025) organizes LLM agents in hierarchical structure, where each layer refines and combines the outputs from the preceding layer. Beyond sequence-level aggregation, Xu et al. (2024b) introduced token-level ensembling method that merges LLM distributions at each decoding step using global alignment matrix. Although effective, ensemble methods are computationally expensive due to the simultaneous activation of multiple LLMs during inference. Routing methods optimize efficiency by selectively invoking specific LLMs based on input characteristics, thereby reducing the computational cost of ensemble approaches. Hybrid-LLM (Ding et al., 2024) trains BERT-based router on synthetic preference labels generated using BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) to dynamically assign queries to either small or large model, depending on predicted query complexity and the desired output quality. RouteLLM (Ong et al., 2025) adopts similar approach but utilizes real human preference labels from Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) to train the router. While these methods reduce costs and maintain high-quality responses with minimal latency, their reliance on task-specific router training limits their ability to generalize to new scenarios. Model merging methods (Wortsman et al., 2022) aim to directly combine the parameters of multiple models into single unified model. While enhancing robustness and generalization, they are limited to homogeneous model families. Xu et al. (2024c) introduced strategy for merging models with differing depths and widths by aligning cohesive layer groups and applying elastic neuron zipping to project weights into common space. While this approach allows for the merging of heterogeneous models, it encounters scalability challenges due to high computational complexity with large models. Model fusion methods seek to consolidate the capabilities of multiple source models into single target model and can be categorized as either explicit or implicit. Explicit model fusion (EMF) techniques, such as FuseLLM (Wan et al., 2024a) and FuseChat (Wan et al., 2024b), transfer knowledge from multiple source LLMs to target LLM through multi-teacher knowledge distillation. FuseChat implements two-stage process: first, it performs pairwise fusion between each source model and pivot model; next, it merges the resulting homologous models in parameter space. While EMF methods adapt to various architectures and model sizes, they face challenges like vocabulary alignment and merging distribution matrices. To address these issues, WRPO (Yang et al., 2025) introduces implicit model fusion (IMF), which uses source model responses as auxiliary signals"

            "content": "during on-policy preference optimization. WRPO progressively shifts optimization from the target models on-policy outputs to high-reward off-policy responses from the source models. Preference Alignment Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for their effectiveness. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022) is widely used approach for this purpose. However, RLHF relies on complex reinforcement learning techniques like proximal policy optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), which can be challenging to implement and prone to instability during training. To address these challenges, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) offers simplified alternative by directly optimizing the policy model based on closed-form implicit reward function derived from human preference data. This approach simplifies implementation, reduces computational costs, enhances training stability, and maintains strong alignment with human preferences."

            "content": "The data construction process is pivotal in enabling the implicit model fusion (IMF) technique utilized by FuseChat-3.0. This section outlines the methods used for prompt selection, response sampling, and data construction, highlighting the rationale behind our design choices. 3.1 PROMPT SELECTION Our primary objective is to curate diverse dataset that enhances the comprehensive capabilities of target LLMs across multiple domains, including instruction following, mathematics, coding, and Chinese language proficiency. To accomplish this, we strategically select data from reputable opensource community datasets and implement targeted filtering and preprocessing techniques. Below is an overview of the key datasets and filtering criteria employed: Instruction Following: The dataset is selected from multiple sources, including UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2024), Magpie-Pro-DPO (Xu et al., 2025), and HelpSteer2 (Wang et al., 2024c). To maintain focus on general conversation, we systematically excluded code and mathematicsrelated data, ultimately assembling 80,907 distinct samples. Mathematics: We incorporate mathematical prompts from OpenMathInstruct-2 (Toshniwal et al., 2025), which yields approximately 52,000 unique entries with validated solutions. Coding: Our coding dataset is constructed from LeetCode1 problems and Self-Oss-InstructSC2 (Lozhkov et al., 2024). We specifically select problems that include comprehensive test cases for validation purposes, resulting in final collection of 16,005 samples. Chinese Language: The Chinese language dataset is created by integrating Alpaca-GPT4Zh (Peng et al., 2023) and Magpie-Qwen2-Pro-Zh (Xu et al., 2025). After filtering out code and mathematics-related content, we obtain approximately 10,000 high-quality samples that specifically focus on Chinese dialogues. 3.2 RESPONSE SAMPLING For each prompt within the curated datasets, we sample responses primarily from four prominent source LLMs: Gemma-2-27B-it (Team et al., 2024), Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 (Jiang et al., 2023a), Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024a), and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024). The response sampling strategy varies based on the specific domain: Instruction Following: For each prompt, we sample five responses from each source model. Mathematics: We maintain the same sampling methodology as in the Instruction Following category. Additionally, we incorporate responses generated by Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024) and Qwen-2.5-Math-72B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024b) to enhance the correctness of our mathematical solution pool. Coding: To ensure broader range of coding solutions, we collect eight distinct responses from each source model per prompt. Chinese Language: We utilize Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct for response generation in this category given its specialized optimization for the Chinese language. 1https://huggingface.co/datasets/greengerong/leetcode"

            "content": "Unlike previous methods (Tunstall et al., 2024; Lambert et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025), which construct preference pairs from different models with varying output styles, FuseChat-3.0 leverages the best and worst responses generated by the same source model to construct each preference pair and optimize the target model. This intra-model pairing eliminates the reward bias associated with heterogeneous response styles, prevents reward hacking, and offers more controlled preference signal. The data construction process varies based on the specific domain. For instruction-following and conversational data, we employ an external reward model to evaluate the sampled responses. In contrast, responses in mathematics and coding domains are verified through rule-based systems. We show the specific procedures for each domain as below: Instruction Following: To assign reward model (RM) scores to the five responses generated by each source model, we employ ArmoRM-LLaMA3-8B-v0.1 (Wang et al., 2024a) for annotation. We then divide the annotated data into SFT and DPO datasets using 4:6 ratio. During the SFT phase, we select the highest RM-scoring response for each prompt across all source models for initial training. In the DPO phase, preference pairs are constructed by pairing responses from the same source model. Responses with the highest RM scores within each model are labeled as positive samples, while those with the lowest scores are treated as negative samples. We then use pairs where the positive responses have the highest RM scores to fine-tune the target model. To ensure the quality of preference signals, we impose constraint on the RM score difference between positive and negative samples when constructing preference pairs, limiting it to the range of 0.01 to 0.1. This measure aims to maintain distinguishability between chosen and rejected samples, thereby minimizing potential interference to the optimization process caused by small differences or annotation noise, and thus improving the robustness and convergence of training. Mathematics: Responses from all source models are initially evaluated for correctness by comparing extracted answers against gold labels. This assessment is complemented by RM scores provided by ArmoRM-LLaMA3-8B-v0.1, ensuring both factual accuracy and adherence to stylistic preferences. We then strategically partition the dataset into SFT and DPO partitions. The SFT phase incorporates responses that are both correct and exhibit the highest RM scores. This selection strategy ensures that the fine-tuning process is grounded in high-quality responses closely aligned with the desired task outcomes. For the DPO phase, we construct paired samples from the same source model, as described above. Positive samples consist of correct answers with the highest RM scores, while negative samples comprise incorrect answers with the lowest RM scores. Coding: We employ verification method comprising correctness scores and RM scores for coding evaluation. Correctness scores assess whether the generated code passes both static analysis checks and provided test cases, ensuring functional accuracy. The RM scores are used for preference evaluation, gauging the overall quality of responses based on predefined criteria. During the SFT phase, we select responses that not only pass all test cases but also achieve the highest RM scores. This rigorous selection ensures that the model is fine-tuned on exemplary code meeting both correctness and preference standards. In the DPO phase, we compare positive sampleshighscoring responses that pass all evaluationswith negative sampleslow-scoring responses that fail the tests, both originating from the same source model. This comparison aims to optimize the models ability to prefer higher-quality and functionally correct code during training. Critically, we exclude instances where all model responses fail to meet the testing criteria. This exclusion is implemented to maintain the integrity of the evaluation process, as such cases do not provide meaningful data for assessing and improving the models performance. Chinese Language: We exclusively utilize responses sampled from Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct during the SFT phase, due to its strong performance in the Chinese language. This focused approach aims to maximize the transfer of high-quality Chinese language capabilities to the target model. Since no suitable reward models were available for this dataset, we opted to omit the DPO phase. 2https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm"

The first stage involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to address distributional discrepancies between the target and source LLMs. Building on the SFT initialization, the second stage employs preference learning, specifically Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), to learn preferences from multiple source LLMs. 4.1 SUPERVISED FINE-TUNING Given prompt xi and its corresponding output yi of length from the fine-tuning dataset DSFT, we denote the sequence preceding the t-th token in the output as yi,<t = (yi,1, yi,2, . . . , yi,t1). The SFT objective for language model with parameters θ is to minimize the negative log-likelihood: LSFT(θ) = E(xi,yi)DSFT (cid:34) (cid:88) t= log pθ(yi,t yi,<t, xi) , (1) (cid:35) where pθ(yi,t yi,<t, xi) represents the models predicted probability for the t-th token yi,t in yi, conditioned on the prompt xi and the preceding tokens yi,<t. In our experiments, we use the Llama-Factory library3 (Zheng et al., 2024) to implement the finetuning. For all target models, we perform fine-tuning for 3 epochs, with batch size of 128 and maximum sequence length of 2048 tokens. cosine learning rate schedule with warmup ratio of 0.1 is employed. The learning rates for different models are shown in Table 2. 4.2 DIRECT PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION The DPO objective directly optimizes policy to align with human preferences by leveraging supervised learning objective on human-labeled preference data. DPO reformulates the reward function to yield closed-form solution for the optimal policy π. The reparameterized optimal reward function r(x, y) is denoted as: r(x, y) = β log π(y x) πref(y x) where Z(x) is the partition function, πref denotes the reference policy, and β is hyperparameter controlling the deviation from πref. Given preference dataset DDPO consisting of triplets (x, yw, yl), where yw and yl are the preferred and dispreferred completions for given prompt x, the preference probability for yw over yl is modeled using the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley & Terry, 1952): + β log Z(x), (2) p(yw yl x) = σ (cid:18) β log π(yw x) πref(yw x) β log π(yl x) πref(yl x) (cid:19) .

However, we observe slight decline of 0.3 average points in coding tasks, which may be attributed to the relatively limited coding data in our training set. Secondly, the consistent improvements across different model sizes, ranging from 1B to 8B, for the Llama-3 series demonstrate the scalability of FuseChat-3.0. Notably, when applied to Llama-3.2-3BInstruct, FuseChat-3.0 achieves an average score of 40.2, nearly matching Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, which is 2.7 times larger. This highlights the potential of FuseChat-3.0 to enable smaller models to perform comparably to their larger counterparts, offering significant efficiency gains. Finally, when applied to the stronger target model, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, FuseChat-3.0 achieves an average improvement of 2.9 points, despite the higher baseline performance. While the relative improvement is smaller compared to the Llama-3 models, FuseChat-3.0 still boosts performance across several benchmarks. For instance, on AlpacaEval-2, FuseChat-3.0 boosts the score by 30.4 points. Similarly, on Arena-Hard, it achieves an improvement of 10.7 points. When using Gemma-2-9B-it as the target model, FuseChat-3.0 also delivers an average performance gain of 4.3 points. These results validate FuseChat-3.0 as an effective and scalable framework for enhancing capabilities through implicit knowledge fusion, achieving significant performance gains across model architectures and scales without requiring architectural modifications or massive computational resources."

            "title": "5.3 COMPARISON WITH TÜLU 3",
            "content": "We conduct comparative analysis between our FuseChat3.0 framework and AllenAIs recently introduced Tülu 3 (Lambert et al., 2024). Tülu 3 employs an extensive training pipeline, which includes leveraging 22 models for data synthesis, GPT-4o for preference annotation, training dataset exceeding 1.2 million data points, and three-stage training pipeline including SFT, DPO, and PPO. As shown in Figure 3, our FuseChat-Llama-3.1-8BInstruct model outperforms Llama-3.1-Tulu-8B across all evaluation categories. FuseChat-3.0 achieves an overall score of 47.3, exceeding Tülu 3 by 7.1 points. The performance gap is most pronounced in the instruction-following category, where FuseChat leads by 11.4 points. Superior performance is also demonstrated in the general, mathematics, and coding categories. These results suggest that while Tülu 3 benefits from sophisticated training pipeline and large dataset, our FuseChat-3.0 framework achieves better performance through efficient implicit model fusion. By rigorously curating each preference pair from the best and worst responses generated by the same source model, FuseChat-3.0 effectively mitigates reward bias and variance inherent in Tülu 3s approach, which constructs each preference pair using different models. These more controlled preference signals enable FuseChat-3.0 to achieve high performance with significantly lower computational cost during the preference optimization process. Figure 3: Comparison between FuseChatLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-Tulu8B across different domains. Domain scores are obtained by averaging the scores of the benchmarks within that domain. 5.4 EFFECTIVENESS OF LENGTH-NORMALIZED DPO We investigate the impact of length normalization on the DPO stage of our FuseChat-3.0 and present the results in Figure 4. When using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the target model, we show that length-normalized DPO (LN-DPO) generally leads to performance gains compared to both the standard DPO approach and the base model. Specifically, FuseChatLN-DPO achieves the highest overall score of 47.3, surpassing FuseChatDPOs 46.2 and the base models 42.6. The most significant improvements due to length normalization are observed in the mathematics and coding categories. We attribute these substantial gains to the fact that length normalization effectively mitigates the length bias inherent in preference pairs. By reducing the models tendency to favor longer responses, this technique ensures that the optimization process prioritizes correctness and completeness over unnecessary verbosity, which is particularly crucial in mathematics and coding domains requiring precise solutions. While LN-DPO also yields improvements in other categories, these gains are less substantial. These findings further reinforce that length normalization is valuable technique for enhancing the performance of DPO-trained models, including FuseChat-3.0. Figure 4: Comparison between lengthnormalized DPO and vanilla DPO in FuseChat3.0. Base denotes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct."

            "title": "6 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "In this paper, we introduce FuseChat-3.0, suite of large language models (LLMs) designed to integrate the strengths of heterogeneous source LLMs into more compact and efficient target models. To harness the diverse capabilities of these source models, we develop specialized data construction protocol tailored to various tasks and domains. The FuseChat-3.0 training pipeline consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the target model with source model distributions, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) stage to incorporate preferences from multiple source LLMs for further refinement. By leveraging four powerful open-source LLMs as source models and finetuning five smaller models as targets, FuseChat-3.0 consistently achieves substantial performance gains across 14 established benchmarks. These results highlight its effectiveness in transferring and integrating the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs into smaller, more efficient models."

GPT-4-Preview-1106 serves as both the baseline model and the evaluator for the other models. Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024) is challenging instruction-following benchmark that closely aligns with the human preference ranking from Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024), crowd-sourced platform for evaluating LLMs. It spans 250 high-quality topic clusters including 500 well-defined technical problem-solving queries. We report the win rate against GPT-4-0314 using GPT-4-Preview-1106 as the judge model. MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) contains 80 multi-turn dialogues across eight categories, including writing, roleplay, reasoning, math, coding, extraction, STEM, and humanities. Each response is evaluated by GPT-4 on scale from 1 to 10, with the average score reported for each dialogue turn across the 80 dialogues. We use GPT-4-0613 as the judge model following the official setting. AlignBench v1.1 (Liu et al., 2023) is comprehensive multi-dimensional benchmark for evaluating LLMs alignment in Chinese. It contains 683 high-quality samples spanning 8 main categories, namely fundamental language ability, advanced Chinese understanding, open-ended questions, writing ability, logical reasoning, mathematics, task-oriented role play, and professional knowledge. We employ GPT-4-0613 to analyze and subsequently grade the responses. LiveBench-0831 (White et al., 2025) mitigates test set contamination through monthly question updates and the use of recently released data sources. It features verifiable, objective ground-truth answers for automatic and accurate scoring, eliminating the need for LLM-based evaluation. MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b) is an enhanced version of the MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) dataset, designed to address issues such as noisy data and reduced difficulty due to advances in model capabilities and increased data contamination. MMLU-Pro increases challenge levels by expanding"
