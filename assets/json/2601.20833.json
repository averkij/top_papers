            "content": "As research increasingly moves toward fully autonomous scientific discovery, large language model (LLM)-based agents have attracted growing attention for their ability to automate complex research workflows (Chai et al., 2025; Cornelio et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). Recent systems (Lu et al., 2024; Yamada et al., 2025; Gottweis et al., 2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (Jin et al., 2024; Sahu et al., 2025; Ajith et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025b, 2026). Despite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (Wang et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2024; Mitchener et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As result, the cost of producing single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (Lu et al., 2024). Similarly, in (Schmidgall 1 Figure 1 Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions. et al., 2025b), literature review and experimental planning alone account for significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language models ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (Wang et al., 2025a; Shin et al., 2025). To address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner. Our work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery : (1) We introduce Idea2Story, framework that formalizes autonomous research as pre-computationdriven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and maintained in continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the 2 inefficiency and unreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting."

            "content": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific discovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental execution (Hu et al., 2026; Zhang et al., 2025a; Lin et al., 2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (Lu et al., 2024) demonstrate the viability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely linear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including The AI Scientist-v2 (Yamada et al., 2025) and Kosmos (Mitchener et al., 2025), reduce reliance on explicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration. In research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (Si et al., 2024) uncover critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical utility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer review (Liang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025; Thakkar et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2026). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind spots: Shin et al. (2025) shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate emphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human expert judgment, while Sahu et al. (2025) demonstrates that AI reviewers struggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with review scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches such as AgentReview (Jin et al., 2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating diverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in identifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries."

            "title": "2.2 LLM-Driven Agents",
            "content": "LLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments. Despite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systemssuch as OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025b) and SWE-Agent (Yang et al., 2024)exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic codebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies and structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows. As result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks such as MLE-bench (Chan et al., 2024) and SciCode (Tian et al., 2024). RepoMaster (Wang et al., 2025a) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure, including function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents operating in large and complex environments. Beyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor and evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (Schmidgall et al., 2025b) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (Mitchener et al., 2025) further reveal tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral drift (Arike et al., 2025), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (Lu et al., 2024; Schmidgall et al., 2025a; Baek et al., 2025; Hong et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the need for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research systems."

The system transforms such underspecified inputs into structured and academically grounded research directions through two-stage paradigm that separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation: Offline Knowledge Construction. In the offline stage, Idea2Story builds reusable methodological foundation from existing scientific literature. This includes curating large-scale paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, extracting reusable method units that capture core methodological contributions, and organizing these units into structured knowledge graph that encodes their semantic and compositional relations. The resulting knowledge graph serves as persistent repository of methodological abstractions, decoupling literature understanding from runtime reasoning. Online Research Generation. In the online stage, Idea2Story grounds user-provided research ideas through retrieval and composition over the pre-built knowledge graph. Given an informal user idea, the system aligns the input with existing research paradigms, retrieves relevant research patterns, and composes compatible method units into concrete research directions. These instantiated patterns are further refined through review-guided process that iteratively evaluates and revises them with respect to novelty, methodological soundness, and conceptual coherence.

This stage consists of three main components: (i) constructing curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting core method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these units and their composition relations into structured knowledge graph.

Formally, we model method unit extraction as mapping : 𝑝 U𝑝 = {𝑢 (1) 𝑝 , . . . , 𝑢 (𝐾 𝑝 ) 𝑝 }, where 𝑝 denotes single paper and U𝑝 is small set of method units that capture its essential technical ideas. As illustrated in Figure 2, the extraction procedure leverages the standardized structure of academic papers and analyzes different sections to collect complementary methodological signals. Let 𝑝 = (intro 𝑝, method 𝑝, exp 𝑝) denote the partition of paper into its introduction, method, and experiments sections. The introduction is used to identify the high-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides signals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model architectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these mechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from these sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or modeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details. We define method unit 𝑢 U𝑝 as self-contained description of how research problem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and experimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter tuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to the problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one or small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured methodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible methodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method units are combined within single paper. After extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper 𝑝 by vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let 𝑝 = 𝑔(U𝑝), where U𝑝 denotes the set of extracted method units for paper 𝑝 and 𝑔() is an embedding function that maps set of method units to fixed-dimensional representation. To induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply nonlinear dimensionality reduction operator 𝑝 = UMAP(z 𝑝), which projects the high-dimensional embeddings into lower-dimensional space while preserving local semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced representations using DBSCAN, yielding partition = {𝐶1, . . . , 𝐶𝑀 }, where each cluster 𝐶𝑚 corresponds to coherent research pattern. These induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing recurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research patterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition."

While individual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods in practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge graph provides unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units, meta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work. Formally, we define the knowledge graph as directed graph = (V, E), 5 Figure 2 Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. where each node 𝑣 corresponds to canonicalized method unit or meta-method. Canonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared meta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological intent. As result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological elements that are reused across papers. Edges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For given paper 𝑝 with extracted method unit set U𝑝, we add directed edges between pairs of method units (𝑢𝑖, 𝑢 𝑗 ) U𝑝 U𝑝 to indicate that they are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture empirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different method units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations. Aggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields graph structure that encodes both methodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two complementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as canonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from co-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about methods at higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in observed research practice."

The goal is to rank patterns in according to their relevance to 𝑞. 6 Rather than relying on single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts multi-view retrieval formulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions.

The reviewer produces both scalar judgments and concrete revision suggestions. The system then uses this feedback to update the research pattern in targeted manner. When the review indicates insufficient novelty, the system modifies the pattern by recombining compatible method units or introducing alternative realizations within the same pattern family.

Story: Reframe the understanding of LLM finetuning through the lens of learning dynamics, offering unified interpretation of training behaviors and inspiring methods to enhance model alignment and performance.

Case 1 shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into structured set of methodological elements. As shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research problem, the core solution pattern, and the resulting research story. The Base Problem describes the core challenge addressed by the paper, namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending on specific datasets or implementation details. The Solution Pattern summarizes the central methodological idea as an analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without binding it to particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extracted Story reframes the technical 8 contribution at higher level of abstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination and alignment in large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic details to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, the Application field grounds the method unit by indicating downstream research and system-level implications, without enumerating task-specific benchmarks. This example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while filtering out implementation-level details.

As shown in the table, Idea2Story tends to induce higher-level problem reformulation, transforming intent understanding from fixed classification task into dynamic structural reasoning process. The resulting research pattern emphasizes generative refinement, structural priors, and evolving representations. In contrast, the direct LLM baseline largely operates within conventional task formulation, proposing stronger system through the integration of additional components such as context modeling and hierarchical objectives. To reduce evaluation bias, the generated research stories from both approaches are subsequently assessed by an independent large language model (Gemini 3 Pro) (Team et al., 2025), which is not involved in either generation process. The evaluator is instructed to compare the outputs in terms of novelty, methodological substance, and overall research quality, without access to the generation method used. Across all evaluated cases, the externally evaluated results consistently favor the outputs generated by Idea2Story. In particular, the research stories produced by direct LLM generation tend to remain at high level of abstraction, with less concrete methodological grounding and reliance on 9 Aspect Title Abstract Focus Problem Definition Core Research Gap Method Skeleton Innovation Claims Idea2Story Generated (IntentDiff) LLM Direct Generated (EcoIntent) IntentDiff: Reframing E-commerce Intent Classification via Structural Evolution and Context-Aware Diffusion EcoIntent: Context-Aware Multi-Granularity Agent for E-commerce Intent Understanding via Hierarchical Contrastive Learning Reinterprets intent classification as structural evolution process rather than static text classification. The approach leverages diffusion-based framework to iteratively refine noisy query representations into precise intent labels, integrates product graph embeddings to ground predictions in e-commerce context, and introduces discrete, context-aware tokenizer to handle long-tail domain vocabulary. Reframes e-commerce intent classification from static text prediction to dynamic structural reasoning. User queries are short, ambiguous, and heavily dependent on implicit catalog structure, which fixed-label classification fails to capture. Intent understanding is modeled as an evolving process under structural constraints. Existing intent classification methods treat queries in isolation and ignore domain-specific structural priors in e-commerce. They fail to exploit rich relationships between products and attributes, and standard vocabularies struggle with long-tail, domain-specific terminology. No prior work unifies diffusion-based refinement with structural graph embeddings for intent disambiguation. diffusion-based classifier that iteratively denoises intent representations; context-aware discrete tokenizer based on VQ-VAE variant to encode diverse e-commerce queries; and integration of pretrained product graph embeddings as structural priors during the denoising process. (1) Reformulates intent classification as diffusionbased dynamic refinement process; (2) Introduces discrete, context-aware intent tokenization to better handle long-tail domain vocabulary; (3) Enhances intent reasoning by incorporating product graph structural embeddings. Targets improved intent classification performance by integrating heterogeneous behavioral context and hierarchical product knowledge. dual-stream architecture aligns semantic representations with user interaction history, and hierarchical contrastive learning enforces consistency across fineand coarse-grained intent categories. Formulates intent understanding as conventional multi-class classification problem, where the input is query augmented with session context and the output is an intent label from predefined set. The main challenge is semantic sparsity caused by short and ambiguous queries. Prior work suffers from (1) context isolation, where behavioral signals such as clicks are underutilized, and (2) flat-label assumption that ignores the hierarchical nature of e-commerce taxonomies, leading to inconsistent predictions for fine-grained, long-tail intents. dual-stream discriminative architecture consisting of BERT-based text encoder, lightweight GNN for aggregating behavioral interaction graphs, and prediction head trained with hierarchical contrastive learning; parameter-efficient adaptation via LoRA. (1) Contextualized intent modeling via joint reasoning over text and behavioral graphs; (2) Hierarchical contrastive learning leveraging product taxonomies; (3) Parameter-efficient system design achieving strong performance at reduced computational cost. Table 1 Comparison of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and direct LLM baseline, both starting from the same underspecified user input: want to build an e-commerce agent that can better understand user intent. The table contrasts how different generation mechanisms transform the same vague research intent into concrete research patterns. relatively standard techniques. In contrast, Idea2Story-generated research patterns exhibit clearer problem framing, more specific methodological structures, and stronger signals of novelty."

            "content": "While Idea2Story focuses on grounding vague research intent into structured and high-quality research patterns, an important direction for future work is to extend this framework toward fully closed-loop research generation pipeline. promising extension is the integration of experiment-driven agents that can instantiate, validate, and iteratively refine generated research patterns through empirical feedback, including automated experimental design, dataset selection, and 10 preliminary execution. Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections. By grounding paper generation in empirically validated research patterns, such system could move beyond surface-level text generation and provide more faithful, end-to-end support for executable and publishable scientific discovery."

            "content": "We presented Idea2Story, pre-computationdriven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge structuring. By explicitly extracting reusable method units and organizing them into continuously updated knowledge graph, Idea2Story enables research agents to reason over stable research patterns rather than repeatedly processing raw papers. Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure, and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern modeling as foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research. Looking ahead, integrating Idea2Story with experimental agents to close the loop from abstract research patterns to validated empirical results represents promising direction toward fully autonomous and trustworthy scientific discovery."
