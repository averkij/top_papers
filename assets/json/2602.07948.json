            "title": "1 Introduction\nCollective motion in biological systems represents a paradigmatic example of emergent complexity, wherein\nmacroscopic spatiotemporal order arises spontaneously from local interactions among constituent agents [1, 2].\nSchools of fish, flocks of birds, swarms of insects, and herds of mammals all exhibit coherent group-level behaviors\nthat cannot be predicted from the properties of isolated individuals, placing these phenomena squarely within the\ndomain of statistical physics and complex systems science [3]. The theoretical understanding of such collective\nstates has advanced substantially over the past three decades, driven by the recognition that active matter\nsystems—composed of self-propelled particles that consume energy to generate motion—obey fundamentally\ndifferent organizing principles than equilibrium thermodynamic systems [4].",
            "content": "Fish schooling constitutes perhaps the most extensively studied instance of biological collective motion, owing to the accessibility of laboratory experiments, the economic importance of commercial fisheries, and the striking visual regularity of natural schools [5, 6]. Empirical observations have established that schooling fish maintain characteristic nearest-neighbor distances, align their velocities with nearby conspecifics, and respond to perturbations through rapid information transfer across the group [7, 8]. These behavioral regularities motivated the development of agent-based models that distill the essential interaction rules governing collective dynamics while remaining analytically and computationally tractable [9, 10]. The seminal contribution of Vicsek et al. [11] introduced minimal self-propelled particle model that captured the essential physics of flocking through velocity alignment interactions subject to angular noise. This model demonstrated that systems of active particles undergo continuous phase transition from disordered to ordered collective motion as noise amplitude decreases, analogous to the ferromagnetic transition in spin systems. Subsequent theoretical analysis revealed that the Vicsek model belongs to distinct universality class characterized 1 by giant density fluctuations and long-range orientational correlations absent in equilibrium systems [12, 13]. The conceptual framework established by this work has informed virtually all subsequent modeling efforts in collective behavior. Couzin et al. [14] extended the Vicsek paradigm by introducing zone-based behavioral architecture that more faithfully represents the graduated response of fish to neighbors at different distances. Their model partitions the space surrounding each agent into three concentric regions: Zone of Repulsion (ZOR) governing collision avoidance, Zone of Orientation (ZOO) mediating velocity alignment, and Zone of Attraction (ZOA) generating long-range cohesion. This hierarchical structure, combined with lexicographic priority rule that ensures collision avoidance supersedes social coordination, produces rich phase diagram encompassing swarm, torus (milling), dynamic parallel, and highly parallel collective states [14, 15]. The Couzin model has since become standard reference for theoretical and computational studies of fish schooling, with applications spanning behavioral ecology, robotics, and network science [16, 17]. Despite the maturity of the theoretical framework, computational tools for simulating and analyzing Couzin model dynamics remain fragmented across research groups, with most implementations existing as unpublished laboratory codes lacking standardized interfaces, comprehensive diagnostics, or archival data formats [18]. This situation contrasts sharply with neighboring fields such as molecular dynamics, where community codes like LAMMPS and GROMACS provide validated, documented, and extensible platforms that accelerate scientific progress through reproducibility and interoperability [19, 20]. The absence of analogous infrastructure for collective behavior modeling impedes systematic parameter exploration, cross-study comparison, and integration with observational datasets from field studies [21]. parallel limitation concerns the diagnostic metrics employed to characterize collective states. The classical order parameterspolarization quantifying velocity alignment and rotation measuring milling coherence provide essential but incomplete descriptions of school organization [14, 22]. Two configurations with identical (P, ) values may nonetheless differ substantially in their spatial structure, velocity correlations, or morphological characteristics. Information-theoretic measures based on Shannon entropy offer complementary perspective by quantifying the spread or concentration of relevant distributions rather than their first moments [23, 24]. Entropybased diagnostics have proven valuable in characterizing phase transitions, detecting early warning signals of critical slowing, and distinguishing superficially similar collective states in both simulations and experiments [25, 26]. The application of entropy metrics to fish schooling has received limited attention despite the potential for extracting richer organizational signatures from simulation and observational data. Marine biologists have long recognized that schools exhibit complex internal structureincluding density gradients, positional preferences, and shape variationsthat influence predator evasion, foraging efficiency, and hydrodynamic performance [6, 27]. Translating these biological insights into quantitative diagnostics requires metrics sensitive to the full distribution of relevant observables rather than summary statistics alone. Furthermore, the three-dimensional character of oceanic environments introduces vertical stratification and depth-dependent behaviors absent in two-dimensional laboratory studies, necessitating metrics that capture this additional dimensionality [28]. Here we present dewi-kadita, an open-source Python library that provides complete computational framework for three-dimensional Couzin model simulation with comprehensive entropy-based diagnostics tailored for marine collective behavior research. The library implements the full zone-based interaction architecture including visual field constraints, bounded turning rates, and stochastic perturbations, while introducing seven specialized entropy metrics that characterize distinct aspects of school organization: cohesion entropy based on nearest-neighbor distance distributions, polarization entropy quantifying velocity orientation spread, depth stratification entropy measuring vertical position uniformity, angular momentum entropy characterizing milling behavior, nearest-neighbor entropy capturing local density structure, velocity correlation entropy describing pairwise alignment distributions, and school shape entropy derived from principal component analysis of positional covariance. These metrics combine into an Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) that provides single scalar measure of collective disorder suitable for time series analysis and phase classification. The software architecture leverages Numba just-in-time (JIT) compilation [29] for computational efficiency and produces Climate and Forecast (CF) compliant Network Common Data Format (NetCDF4) output [30] ensuring interoperability with standard oceanographic analysis tools and adherence to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles [31]. Pythons dominance in scientific computing offers mature numerical libraries and broad ecosystem integration essential for research dissemination [32, 33]. Numba JIT compilation eliminates performance concerns, achieving near-native speeds for pairwise interaction kernels while maintaining accessibility for rapid prototyping and collaborative development. This approach mirrors successful strategies in adjacent computational fields, positioning dewi-kadita as both production infrastructure and pedagogical tool for collective behavior research."

            "content": "2 collective dynamics following the seminal formulation of Couzin et al. [14], treating each fish as self-propelled particle with constrained orientational degrees of freedom. Consider an ensemble of self-propelled agents confined within three-dimensional periodic domain Ω = [0, L]3 possessing toroidal topology. The imposition of periodic boundary conditions permits simulation of effectively unbounded oceanic environments while maintaining finite computational domain, reflecting the observation that natural fish schools typically occupy spatial scales much smaller than the water bodies they inhabit [5]. The state of each agent {1, 2, . . . , } at discrete time is completely specified by the ordered pair (ri(t), vi(t)), where the position vector ri R3 resides on the three-torus T3 = R3/(LZ)3 and the velocity vector vi R3 determines both direction and magnitude of motion. The complete system state therefore inhabits the product manifold = (T3)N (R3)N . fundamental kinematic constraint governing fish locomotion is the maintenance of approximately constant swimming speed, reflecting physiological regulation mechanisms that decouple speed control from directional adjustment [34]. We therefore impose the constant-speed constraint where v0 > 0 denotes the constant cruising speed. Defining the unit velocity vector vi(t) = v0, ˆvi = vi vi , (1) (2) the constraint (1) reduces the velocity degrees of freedom from R3 to the unit two-sphere S2 = {x R3 : = 1}, fundamentally altering the dynamical character of the system relative to passive Brownian particles and placing it within the class of self-propelled particle models [11]. The toroidal geometry necessitates careful treatment of interparticle distances. For agents and with positions ri = (xi, yi, zi) and rj = (xj, yj, zj), the displacement vector respecting periodic boundaries follows from the minimum image convention: ij = rj ri round , (3) (cid:19) (cid:18) rj ri where the rounding operation round() applies component-wise and maps each component to the nearest integer. The interparticle separation is then given by dij = ij = (cid:113) 2 ij,x + ij,y + 2 ij,z, (4) 3/2, corresponding to the maximum possible distance within the fundamental domain. which satisfies dij This construction ensures that each agent perceives its neighbors through the topologically shortest path, crucial requirement for correct simulation of periodic systems. The behavioral response architecture introduced by Couzin et al. [14] comprises three concentric spherical zones surrounding each focal individual, reflecting empirically observed gradations in fish response to neighbors at different distances [6, 9]. The innermost region, designated the ZOR, is defined by ZORi = {j = : 0 < dij < rr}, (5) and governs collision avoidance behavior. When conspecifics intrude within the critical radius rr, the focal agent experiences repulsive stimulus that supersedes all other social interactions. The intermediate shell, termed the ZOO, spans (6) ZOOi = {j = : rr dij < ro}, and mediates velocity alignment interactions analogous to ferromagnetic spin coupling in condensed matter systems [11]. The outermost region, the ZOA, encompasses ZOAi = {j = : ro dij < ra}, and generates cohesive tendencies that maintain school integrity over larger spatial scales. The zone radii satisfy the strict hierarchy 0 < rr < ro ra, ensuring unambiguous classification of all pairwise interactions. (7) Anatomical constraints on ocular positioning endow fish with posterior blind region that must be incorporated into the interaction model [6]. We parametrize this limitation through conical blind zone of half-angle α [0, 180] extending behind each agent along its negative velocity direction. Neighbor falls within the visual field of agent if and only if the angular criterion ˆvi ij ij is satisfied, where θij denotes the angle between the focal agents heading and the direction toward neighbor j. The set of visible neighbors > cos α cos θij = (8) ˆvi ij ij thus excludes individuals located within the rear blind cone, introducing an essential asymmetry into the interaction topology. The limiting cases α = 0 and α = 180 correspond to complete omnidirectional vision and hemispherical forward-only field, respectively. > cos α = : Vi = (9) (cid:26) (cid:27) The effective neighborhoods for each behavioral zone incorporate both distance and visibility constraints. The repulsion neighborhood is defined as the orientation neighborhood as and the attraction neighborhood as Ri = {j = : dij < rr and Vi}, Oi = {j = : rr dij < ro and Vi}, (10) (11) Ai = {j = : ro dij < ra and Vi}. The response vectors for each behavioral zone derive from optimization principles governing fish behavior. Within the ZOR, agent seeks to maximize its distance from intruding neighbors. Defining the unit displacement vector (12) the repulsion response vector is computed as ˆij = ij ij , d(r) = (cid:88) ˆij. jRi (13) (14) The negative sign ensures motion directed away from neighbors, while the use of unit vectors prevents distant intruders from dominating the aggregate response. For neighbors within the ZOO, the focal agent seeks to minimize angular deviation from the local consensus heading. This alignment tendency produces the orientation response vector d(o) = (cid:88) jOi ˆvj, (15) where ˆvj is the unit velocity of neighbor as defined in (2). This summation of unit velocity vectors parallels the computation of magnetization in spin systems, with the resultant direction representing the locally averaged heading. The attraction response governing behavior toward distant visible neighbors derives from cohesion optimization: (cid:88) (16) d(a) = ˆij. jAi This vector points toward the angular centroid of distant neighbors, generating the long-range cohesive force essential for maintaining school integrity. The zone responses combine according to lexicographic priority rule that reflects the biological primacy of collision avoidance [14, 35]. The desired direction di governing agent takes the form di = d(r) wod(o) + d(a) if d(r) > 0, if d(r) = 0 and (Oi > 0 or Ai > 0), (17) ˆvi otherwise, where wo [0, 1] denotes the orientation weight parameter and denotes set cardinality. This weighting factor modulates the relative influence of alignment versus cohesion forces when repulsion is absent, enabling continuous interpolation between milling-dominated dynamics at low wo and alignment-dominated behavior at high wo. The priority structure ensures that collision avoidance always supersedes social coordination, consistent with the survival imperative. When no neighbors occupy any zone, the agent maintains its current heading. The orientational dynamics of each agent are subject to biological constraints on angular velocity. Fish cannot execute instantaneous reorientation; rather, their turning rate is bounded by maximum value determined by hydrodynamic and physiological factors [36]. Let θmax > 0 denote the maximum angular displacement achievable per time step t. The constrained rotation from current direction ˆvi toward the normalized desired direction proceeds as follows. First, compute the angular separation between current and target orientations: ϕi = arccos (cid:16) clip(ˆvi ˆdi, 1, 1) (cid:17) , ˆdi = di di (18) (19) where clip(x, a, b) = max(a, min(x, b)) ensures numerical stability. The deterministic component of the updated direction then takes the form vi = where the interpolation parameter (1 τi)ˆvi + τi (1 τi)ˆvi + τi ˆdi if ϕi θmax, otherwise, ˆdi ˆdi (20) (21) τi = θmax ϕi 4 parametrizes partial rotation toward the target. This normalized linear interpolation (NLERP) scheme approximates spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) with error O(θ3 max) for small turning angles, which is negligible for the turning rates typical of biological parameter regimes. Environmental turbulence, sensory uncertainty, and intrinsic behavioral variability necessitate incorporation of stochastic perturbations into the orientational dynamics [14]. We model these fluctuations through additive Gaussian noise characterized by amplitude σ: ˆv = vi + σξi vi + σξi , (22) where ξi = (ξi,x, ξi,y, ξi,z) denotes three-dimensional random vector with independent standard normal components: ξi,k (0, 1) for {x, y, z}. The normalization operation projects the perturbed vector back onto S2, preserving the unit-speed constraint (1). In the small-noise limit σ 1, this construction approximates isotropic diffusion on the unit sphere."

The updated velocity is then t] mod L, ri(t + t) = [ri(t) + v0 ˆv vi(t + t) = v0 ˆv (24) . The governing equations for the complete dynamical system thus comprise the coupled evolution rules (20)(24) for orientation, velocity, and position of all agents. The characterization of emergent collective states requires macroscopic observables that quantify global organizational structure [14, 1]. The system possesses continuous rotational symmetry in velocity space: absent external fields or boundaries, no direction enjoys privileged status. Spontaneous breaking of this symmetry manifests as collective alignment and is captured by the polarization order parameter (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) This quantity satisfies [0, 1], with 0 indicating an isotropic velocity distribution analogous to paramagnetic phase and 1 signifying complete alignment corresponding to ferromagnetic order. The polarization thus serves as the direct analog of magnetization in classical spin systems [11]. (cid:88) 1 (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) = (25) ˆvi i=1 . The system additionally exhibits rotational symmetry about the collective center of mass. Breaking of this symmetry corresponds to emergence of coherent angular momentum characteristic of milling or torus configurations. Let the group centroid be rcm = 1 N (cid:88) i=1 ri, and define the unit vector from the centroid to agent as ˆr = ri rcm ri rcm . The rotation order parameter is then = (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) 1 (cid:88) ˆr ˆvi (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13) (26) (27) (28) , i=1 which quantifies the coherence of rotational motion about the group center. When 1, all agents circulate in phase about common axis. The two-dimensional order parameter space (P, ) admits four qualitatively distinct collective phases identified by Couzin et al. [14]. The swarm phase, characterized by 0 and 0, exhibits disordered aggregation with neither translational nor rotational coherence, resembling high-temperature paramagnetic state. The torus phase, with moderate polarization but elevated rotation (M 0.5), displays coherent milling wherein agents execute circular orbits about common center, breaking rotational but not translational symmetry. The dynamic parallel phase, featuring high polarization (P 0.7) with residual fluctuations, represents aligned collective motion with significant directional variability analogous to ferromagnet near criticality. The highly parallel phase, distinguished by 0.9 and negligible rotation, constitutes the ground state of the alignmentdominated regime with stable directed motion. Beyond classical order parameters, information-theoretic measures provide complementary characterization of k=1 obtained by organizational complexity in collective systems [15]. For discrete probability distribution {pk}n histogramming continuous observable into bins, the Shannon entropy (cid:88) = pk ln pk (29) k=1 quantifies the uncertainty or disorder present in the distribution, where we adopt the convention 0 ln 0 = 0. The maximum entropy Hmax = ln corresponds to uniform distribution, and normalization by this maximum yields 5 the dimensionless normalized entropy ="

            "content": "[0, 1]. (30) We now define seven specialized entropy metrics designed for characterizing marine collective behavior, each capturing distinct aspects of school organization. The cohesion entropy characterizes the distribution of nearest-neighbor distances (NND), which reflects school compactness and predator defense efficiency [6]. For each agent i, the nearest-neighbor distance is dNN = min j=i dij, (31) computed using periodic boundary conditions via (3)(4). The NND values {dNN nc bins over the interval [0, L/2], producing counts {ck}nc entropy is then }N i=1 are histogrammed into k=1 and probabilities pk = ck/N . The school cohesion Hcoh = (cid:80)nc k=1 pk ln pk ln nc . (32) Tight schools exhibit narrow NND distributions yielding low Hcoh, while dispersed aggregations have broad distributions and high Hcoh. The polarization entropy quantifies the spread of velocity orientations on the unit sphere, capturing alignment disorder distinct from the scalar polarization in (25). Converting unit velocities to spherical coordinates: θi = arccos(ˆvi,z), φi = arctan 2(ˆvi,y, ˆvi,x) + π, (33) where θi [0, π] is the polar angle and φi [0, 2π] is the azimuthal angle. two-dimensional histogram with nθ polar bins and nφ azimuthal bins produces counts hjk. To account for the non-uniform solid angle element sin θ dθ dφ, the histogram is weighted by sin θj where θj is the bin center: Normalizing to probabilities pjk = hjk/ (cid:80) entropy is j,k hjk = hjk sin θj. (34) hjk and flattening to one-dimensional distribution, the polarization Hpol = (cid:80) j,k pjk ln pjk ln(nθnφ) . (35) Aligned schools have concentrated angular distributions (low Hpol), while isotropic velocity fields approach maximum entropy. Fish schools often stratify by depth following thermoclines, oxygen gradients, or light levels. The depth stratification entropy characterizes the uniformity of vertical position distribution. Histogramming the z-coordinates {zi}N i=1 into nz bins over [0, L] produces probabilities {pk}, and the normalized entropy is Hdepth = (cid:80)nz k=1 pk ln pk ln nz . (36) school concentrated at single depth has low Hdepth; uniform vertical spread yields high Hdepth. The angular momentum entropy characterizes the distribution of individual contributions to collective rotation, complementing the scalar rotation parameter in (28). For each agent, the magnitude of the cross product between its radial position (relative to centroid) and velocity direction quantifies its instantaneous contribution to rotational motion: Histogramming {Li}N i=1 into nL bins over [0, 1] and computing the normalized Shannon entropy yields k=1 pk ln pk ln nL (cid:80)nL Hang = . Li = ˆr ˆvi [0, 1]. (37) (38) Coherent milling produces uniform angular momentum contributions (high Hang concentrated near Li 1), while mixed rotational states exhibit variable contributions. Beyond first-nearest-neighbor distances, the variability of distances to multiple neighbors characterizes local density structure and social network topology. For each agent i, compute distances to its nearest neighbors (excluding self): {d(1) }. The coefficient of variation for agent is , . . . , d(k) , d(2) where µi = k1 (cid:80)k distances. Histogramming {CVi}N m=1 d(m) and σi = CVi = , (39) (cid:113) k1 (cid:80)k m=1(d(m) µi)2 are the mean and standard deviation of the k-NN σi µi i=1 into nNN bins over [0, 2] yields the entropy (cid:80)nNN HNN = k=1 pk ln pk ln nNN . (40) Regular spacing patterns produce low CV values with concentrated distributions (low HNN), while irregular local structures yield variable CV. The velocity correlation entropy characterizes the distribution of pairwise velocity alignments, capturing the (43) (44) (45) (46) full correlation structure beyond the mean captured by polarization. For all unique pairs (i, j) with < j, compute the velocity dot product: ρij = ˆvi ˆvj [1, 1]. (41) Shifting to the interval [0, 1] via ρij = (ρij + 1)/2 and histogramming all (N 1)/2 correlation values into nρ bins yields the entropy Hvel = (cid:80)nρ k=1 pk ln pk ln nρ . (42) Highly aligned schools have all correlations near ρij 1 (low Hvel), while disordered schools exhibit correlations spread across [1, 1] (high Hvel). Fish schools adopt various morphologies (spherical, elongated, disc-shaped) depending on behavioral state and environmental conditions [6]. The shape entropy characterizes this morphological variability through principal component analysis.

            "content": "The computational architecture leverages several established scientific computing libraries within the Python ecosystem, each fulfilling specific functional roles. NumPy [37] provides the fundamental data structures and numerical operations: multidimensional arrays store agent positions ri and velocities vi, while vectorized functions compute Euclidean norms via (4), dot products for angular separations in (19) and visual field checks in (8), cross products for the rotation order parameter in (28), and the modular arithmetic enforcing periodic boundary conditions in (23). Random number generation for initial conditions and stochastic perturbations in (22) employs NumPys pseudorandom facilities. SciPy [38] supplies the k-d tree spatial data structure through its cKDTree class, which accelerates nearestneighbor queries required for cohesion entropy computation via (31) and k-NN entropy via (39). The boxsize parameter enables proper handling of periodic boundary conditions, ensuring that distance calculations respect the minimum image convention in (3). This reduces algorithmic complexity from O(N 2) for exhaustive pairwise search to O(N log ) for tree-based queries. Matplotlib [39] generates all visualizations, including three-dimensional renderings of agent configurations using Axes3D projections with quiver plots for velocity vectors, time series of order parameters (t) and (t), and 7 entropy diagnostic panels displaying all seven metrics. The library renders both static summary figures and individual frames for animated sequences. Data serialization employs two complementary libraries. pandas [40] constructs DataFrame objects for tabular output, enabling structured export of order parameter time series, entropy metrics, and final agent states to comma-separated value (CSV) files. NetCDF4 [30] writes self-describing binary files conforming to CF conventions, with proper dimension definitions (time, fish index, spatial coordinate), coordinate variables, and global attributes preserving complete simulation metadata for archival and interoperability with standard oceanographic analysis tools. Pillow provides image processing capabilities for animation generation, applying Gaussian blur filters and brightness enhancement to create underwater visual effects in the rendered frames. tqdm displays progress bars during extended simulation runs and entropy computation loops, providing real-time feedback on computational progress. The computational bottleneck in each time step is the O(N 2) evaluation of pairwise interactions required for zone membership determination and response vector accumulation in (14)(16). Numba [29] addresses this through JIT compilation of the core numerical kernels to optimized machine code. The velocity update function, which evaluates zone membership via (5)(7), accumulates response vectors according to (14)(16), applies the priority rule in (17), and performs constrained rotation via (20), is decorated with compilation directives specifying three operational modes. The nopython=True flag ensures complete compilation without fallback to the Python interpreter, eliminating interpreter overhead. The cache=True flag persists compiled kernels to disk, avoiding recompilation in subsequent sessions. The parallel=True flag combined with prange loop constructs enables automatic distribution of the outer loop over agents across available processor cores. This compilation strategy typically yields acceleration factors of 10100 relative to pure Python implementations, rendering simulations of several hundred agents tractable on standard workstation hardware [41]. The constrained rotation operation implements the spherical interpolation described by (20) through normalized linear interpolation (NLERP). Given current direction ˆvi and normalized desired direction ˆdi from (18), the algorithm first computes the angular separation ϕi according to (19). When ϕi θmax, the agent achieves its desired orientation directly; otherwise, partial rotation proceeds with interpolation parameter τi from (21). Stochastic perturbations enter through additive Gaussian fluctuations as specified in (22), followed by renormalization to the unit sphere. Position updates follow first-order Euler integration of the advection dynamics given by (23). The entropy-based diagnostic metrics require efficient computation of spatial statistics. Nearest-neighbor distance computation for (31) employs the k-d tree with periodic boundary support. The velocity correlation entropy in (42) requires evaluation of all (N 1)/2 unique pairwise dot products, computed efficiently through matrix multiplication VV where is the 3 matrix of unit velocities, followed by extraction of uppertriangular elements. The polarization entropy in (35) properly weights the two-dimensional angular histogram by sin θ to account for the spherical coordinate Jacobian as specified in (34). The school shape entropy in (46) derives from eigenvalue decomposition of the position covariance matrix (44). The dewi-kadita library includes four canonical test cases that systematically explore the phase space of collective behavior, selected to demonstrate the distinct dynamical regimes accessible to the Couzin model and to serve as validation benchmarks. These configurations correspond to well-characterized collective states identified in the original analysis [14]. Case 1 (Swarm) employs parameters producing disordered aggregation: = 150 agents, domain size = 25.0, speed v0 = 1.0, zone radii (rr, ro, ra) = (2.0, 3.0, 15.0), noise amplitude σ = 0.2 rad, turning rate θmax = 0.4 rad, and blind angle α = 30. The large repulsion zone relative to orientation prevents sustained alignment while maintaining loose cohesion, yielding low values of both order parameters (P 0, 0). This configuration models feeding aggregations wherein collision avoidance dominates over coordination. Case 2 (Torus) targets the milling regime through specialized initialization and parameter selection: = 200 agents, (rr, ro, ra) = (1.0, 3.0, 10.0), reduced orientation weight wo = 0.1 in (17), low noise σ = 0.05 rad, reduced turning rate θmax = 0.2 rad, and large blind angle α = 150. Agents begin arranged on horizontal circle with tangential velocities to seed rotational motion. These settings suppress global alignment while preserving local attraction, yielding sustained rotation (M 0.5) with moderate polarization. Case 3 (Dynamic Parallel) produces aligned collective motion with directional fluctuations: = 180 agents, = 28.0, v0 = 1.2, (rr, ro, ra) = (1.0, 10.0, 18.0), σ = 0.12 rad, θmax = 0.35 rad, α = 25, and standard wo = 1.0. The large orientation zone promotes alignment while moderate noise permits directional fluctuations, yielding high polarization (P 0.7) with quasi-periodic reorientation events characteristic of migrating pelagic schools. Case 4 (Highly Parallel) achieves maximum alignment: = 250 agents, = 35.0, v0 = 1.5, (rr, ro, ra) = (1.0, 12.0, 20.0), low noise σ = 0.05 rad, θmax = 0.2 rad, and small blind angle α = 20. These settings produce stable directed motion with polarization approaching unity (P 0.9) and minimal rotation, representing highly coordinated streaming behavior. While these four test cases provide systematic coverage of the primary collective phases, the library supports arbitrary parameter configurations through text-based configuration files or direct Python API access. Users may specify custom values for all model parameters including zone radii (rr, ro, ra), kinematic constraints (v0, θmax), noise amplitude σ, blind angle α, orientation weight wo, ensemble size , domain extent L, and temporal discretization t. Custom initialization protocols beyond standard random and toroidal configurations permit 8 investigation of transient dynamics and relaxation behavior from prescribed initial conditions. Output capabilities encompass multiple formats: time series of order parameters (25)(28) and all entropy metrics (32)(46) export to CSV files; complete trajectory data with full metadata write to CF-compliant NetCDF4 files; static visualizations render to PNG format; and animated three-dimensional trajectories generate as GIF sequences. The modular architecture separates core dynamics, diagnostic computation, data handling, and visualization into distinct subpackages, facilitating extension for specific research applications."

            "content": "Figure 1: Spatiotemporal evolution of collective states across four Couzin model scenarios. Rows correspond to distinct behavioral regimes: Swarm (ac), Torus (df), Dynamic Parallel (gi), and Highly Parallel (jl). Columns represent temporal snapshots at initial (t = 0), middle (t = /2), and final (t = ) simulation times. Three-dimensional quiver plots display fish positions with velocity vectors; instantaneous polarization and rotation values are annotated for each panel. The Swarm configuration maintains disordered aggregation throughout, while the Torus case transitions from initial milling (M = 0.95) toward partial alignment. Both Dynamic Parallel and Highly Parallel cases exhibit rapid ordering from random initial conditions to coherent directed motion (P > 0.98). Figure 1 presents the spatiotemporal evolution of agent configurations across all four scenarios. The Swarm case (panels ac) exhibits persistent disorder characteristic of the paramagnetic-like phase, with both order parameters remaining below 0.1 throughout the = 100 time unit simulation. This behavior emerges from the combination of 9 relatively large repulsion zone (rr = 2.0) that dominates the narrow orientation zone (ro rr = 1.0), elevated noise amplitude (σ = 0.20 rad), and high turning rate (θmax = 0.40 rad). The resulting dynamics prevent sustained alignment while maintaining loose cohesion through the attraction zone, consistent with theoretical predictions for this parameter regime [22]. Spatial statistics reveal that nearest-neighbor distances stabilize around 1.73 0.31 body lengths by the final state, indicating effective collision avoidance without crystalline ordering. The Torus scenario (panels df) was initialized with agents arranged on horizontal circle possessing tangential velocities, yielding an initial rotation parameter = 0.95. However, the system did not maintain stable milling; instead, it evolved toward mixed state with final values = 0.72 and = 0.32. This transition reflects the inherent instability of the torus configuration under the chosen parameters: although the large blind angle (α = 150) and reduced orientation weight (wo = 0.1) favor following behavior, the finite system size and periodic boundary conditions permit spontaneous symmetry breaking toward translational order [42]. The polarization entropy decreased from Hpol = 0.67 initially to Hpol = 0.39 at equilibrium, quantifying the partial alignment that emerged despite parameter settings intended to suppress it. This result underscores that the Couzin model phase boundaries are not sharp and that finite-size effects can drive transitions between nominally distinct collective states [43]. Figure 2: Temporal evolution of classical order parameters for all four scenarios. Each panel displays polarization (solid lines) and rotation (dashed lines) as functions of time, with horizontal dotted lines indicating equilibrium mean values computed over the second half of each simulation. Panel annotations report final values. (a) Swarm: both parameters fluctuate near zero with no sustained ordering. (b) Torus: initial high rotation decays while polarization grows, indicating transition from milling toward partial alignment. (c) Dynamic Parallel: rapid convergence to 0.98 within 30 time units. (d) Highly Parallel: fastest convergence to near-unity polarization (P = 0.998) with minimal fluctuations (σP = 0.0003). The Dynamic Parallel and Highly Parallel configurations (Figure 1, panels gl) both achieved strong alignment from random initial conditions, but with distinct dynamical signatures visible in Figure 2. The Dynamic Parallel case converged to = 0.98 with residual fluctuations (σP = 0.0018), while the Highly Parallel case attained = 0.998 with fluctuations suppressed by an order of magnitude (σP = 0.0003). This difference arises primarily from the noise amplitude: σ = 0.12 rad versus σ = 0.05 rad. The larger orientation zones in both cases (ro = 10 and ro = 12, respectively) ensure that each agent averages over many neighbors when computing its desired heading, providing the long-range velocity correlations necessary for global alignment [44]. The school morphology in the Highly Parallel case (panel l) shows pronounced elongation along the direction of motion, 10 with school shape entropy Hshape = 0.28 indicating strong anisotropy, compared to Hshape = 0.99 for the nearly spherical Dynamic Parallel school. Figure 3: Temporal evolution of oceanic entropy metrics across all scenarios. (a) School cohesion entropy Hcoh based on nearest-neighbor distance distributions. (b) Polarization entropy Hpol quantifying velocity orientation spread on the unit sphere. (c) Velocity correlation entropy Hvel characterizing pairwise alignment distributions. (d) OSI, weighted composite of all seven entropy metrics. Lower values indicate more ordered states. The Highly Parallel case achieves the lowest final OSI (0.24), while Swarm maintains elevated disorder (OSI 0.71) throughout. The entropy-based diagnostics implemented in dewi-kadita provide complementary characterization of collective organization beyond the classical order parameters. Figure 3 displays the temporal evolution of four key metrics. The velocity correlation entropy Hvel proves particularly discriminating: it drops from near-unity (indicating uniform distribution of pairwise correlations across [1, 1]) to effectively zero in the Highly Parallel case, signifying that all velocity pairs have become perfectly correlated (ρij 1). This metric captures information absent from the scalar polarization ; two configurations with identical values could exhibit different Hvel if their correlation distributions differ in shape [25]. The Swarm case maintains Hvel 1.0 throughout, confirming the absence of velocity correlations beyond random expectation. The cohesion entropy Hcoh reveals distinct spacing patterns across scenarios. The Swarm equilibrates at Hcoh = 0.31, reflecting relatively narrow nearest-neighbor distance distribution centered around the repulsion radius. The Highly Parallel case achieves Hcoh = 0.07, indicating highly uniform spacinga consequence of the balance between collision avoidance and the compressive effect of cohesive attraction acting perpendicular to the direction of collective motion [7]. Interestingly, the Torus case exhibits intermediate cohesion entropy (Hcoh = 0.25) with elevated nearest-neighbor variability (coefficient of variation entropy HNN = 0.60), reflecting the density gradients inherent in rotating configurations where agents on the outer edge experience different local environments than those near the center. 11 Figure 4: Final state comparison of all metrics across scenarios. (a) Primary entropy metrics: school cohesion (Hcoh), polarization (Hpol), and velocity correlation (Hvel). (b) Secondary entropy metrics: depth stratification (Hdepth), angular momentum (Hang), nearest-neighbor variability (HNN), and school shape (Hshape). (c) Composite indices: OSI and OI. (d) Classical order parameters: polarization (P ) and rotation (M ). The entropy metrics collectively distinguish all four phases, with OSI providing monotonic ranking from ordered (Highly Parallel, OSI = 0.24) to disordered (Swarm, OSI = 0.71). Figure 4 summarizes the equilibrium entropy profiles, demonstrating that the seven-metric framework successfully discriminates all four collective phases. The OSI ranks the scenarios in intuitive order: Highly Parallel (OSI = 0.24) < Dynamic Parallel (OSI = 0.42) < Torus (OSI = 0.44) < Swarm (OSI = 0.71). This ranking aligns with but refines the OI classification, which cannot distinguish the Torus from Dynamic Parallel cases since both achieve comparable maximum order parameters through different mechanisms (rotation versus polarization). The depth stratification entropy Hdepth remains moderate (0.430.73) across all scenarios, reflecting the absence of vertical gradients in our homogeneous periodic domain; this metric would become informative in simulations incorporating bathymetry, thermoclines, or predator avoidance [28]. The angular momentum entropy Hang provides insight into the heterogeneity of rotational contributions within each school. The Torus case exhibits Hang = 0.74, lower than the Swarm value of 0.79, indicating more uniform individual contributions to collective rotation despite the decay of global milling. This suggests that local rotational correlations persist even as the macroscopic torus structure dissolves. The Dynamic Parallel case shows elevated Hang = 0.81 at equilibrium with high temporal variability (σ = 0.17), consistent with sporadic directional changes that transiently generate rotational motion before the school realigns [8]. The default weighting scheme for the OSI (Equation 48) assigns highest priority to polarization entropy (wpol = 0.28), reflecting the biological primacy of alignment in schooling fish [45]. However, the modular architecture of dewi-kadita permits user-specified weights for applications where other organizational features dominate. For instance, studies of vertical migration might elevate wdepth, while investigations of milling behavior could increase wang. The library outputs all seven component entropies separately, enabling post-hoc reweighting without rerunning simulations. The computational experiments reveal several noteworthy features of the Couzin model dynamics under periodic boundary conditions. First, the convergence timescales vary substantially across phases: the Highly Parallel case achieves 99% of its equilibrium polarization within 20 time units, while the Torus case requires the full = 200 simulation to approach quasi-equilibrium due to the competing tendencies of milling and alignment. Second, the periodic boundaries prevent true school fragmentation, which has been observed experimentally in open domains when noise or perturbations exceed critical thresholds [22]. Third, the stochastic dynamics intro12 duce measurable fluctuations even at equilibrium: the Swarm case exhibits coefficient of variation CVP = 0.45 for polarization, while the Highly Parallel case achieves CVP = 0.0003, spanning three orders of magnitude in relative stability. The CF-compliant NetCDF4 output format ensures interoperability with standard oceanographic analysis tools, facilitating integration of dewi-kadita simulations with observational datasets. Each output file contains complete trajectory data (positions and velocities at all saved time steps), time series of order parameters and entropy metrics, and comprehensive metadata including all model parameters, random seeds, and software versions. This archival completeness supports reproducibility standards increasingly required by funding agencies and journals [46]. The CSV output option provides immediate accessibility for users unfamiliar with NetCDF4 conventions, while the animated GIF sequences enable rapid visual assessment of simulation quality. The present validation confirms that dewi-kadita correctly reproduces the four canonical collective phases identified in the original Couzin formulation [14], while extending the diagnostic framework through informationtheoretic metrics tailored for marine applications. The librarys Numba-accelerated core achieves sufficient performance for parameter sweeps and sensitivity analyses on standard workstation hardware, though users investigating larger ensembles (N > 500) or extended durations may benefit from the parallel loop constructs enabled by the parallel=True compilation flag. Future development priorities include incorporation of heterogeneous agent populations [47], external flow fields representing oceanic currents, and predatorprey interaction modules for studying collective escape responses."
