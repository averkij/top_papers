            "content": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in reasoning, perception, and interaction across both textual and visual data (Wu et al., 2024). Their ability to process and generate content in multiple modalities proves beneficial for tasks like image captioning (Bianco et al., 2023), visual question answering (VQA) (Shao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b), multimodal search (Wu & Xie, 2024), anomaly detection (Xu et al., 2025), and creative design assistance (Li et al., 2024a; Peng et al., 2024). However, as these models become more capable, the risk of generating harmful content also grows, leading to serious questions about their safety and robustness (Liu et al., 2024a; Gu et al., 2024). Jailbreak attacks on MLLMs are designed to manipulate the model into bypassing its safety mechanisms, resulting in harmful outputs (Zhao et al., 2025). These attacks can be carried out in various ways, with one common approach being perturbation-based attacks, where subtle, adversarial modifications are made to input images to disrupt the models alignment. Defenses such as adversarial training have proven effective against such attacks (Yu et al., In this paper, we explore strategies to mitigate attacks 2024a; Xhonneux et al., 2024). *Equal Contribution. Corresponding Author 1 Preprint. Under review. targeting defenses against structure-based jailbreaks (Wang et al., 2024). Structure-based jailbreaks hide harmful prompts in images using visually structured forms that MLLMs can still understand, but traditional defenses cant easily filter out. Several recent works aim to detect and mitigate structure-based jailbreaks in multimodal models (Jiang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2024c), but they face three central challenges: Model Challenge: Some prior works primarily rely on hidden representations of large language models (LLMs) to detect harmful content (Jiang et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2024), often requiring white-box access to the model. This reliance on model hidden states restricts applicability to black-box LLMs, which are prevalent in many commercial and proprietary systems. Our method overcomes this limitation by ensuring effective detection even for black-box models. Speed Challenge: Uncertainty-based detection methods, such as JailGuard and UniGuardian (Yi et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2025), employ input perturbation or random removal of inputs to identify vulnerabilities. While effective, these approaches are computationally expensive and require extensive data augmentation, making them impractical for real-time applications. Our approach enhances efficiency by eliminating the need for computationally heavy perturbations. Data Challenge: Many existing solutions depend on fully labeled harmful datasets (e.g., VLGuard(Zong et al., 2024), GradSafe (Xie et al., 2024)) or few-shot learning approaches (e.g., AdaShield-A(Wang et al., 2024)) for training. However, real-world practitioners often lack access to comprehensive jailbreak datasets and instead rely on high-level policy guidelines to define harmful content. Our framework is designed to operate effectively under these policy-driven constraints, allowing robust detection without requiring explicit exposure to unsafe inputs. To address these challenges, we propose memory-centered test-time adaptive framework, JAILDAM , for detecting jailbreak attempts in vision-language models (VLMs). Our approach introduces novel autoencoder-based detection pipeline that models the relationship between multimodal safe inputs and unsafe memories stored in structured memory bank. This design allows early detection of potential jailbreak attempts by leveraging memory-based attention feature encoding. In addition, we include dynamic test-time adaptation step that refines unsafe memory representations. By updating its memory with emerging unsafe variations, our framework improves generalization beyond known jailbreak strategies and preserves efficiency by removing the need for expensive input perturbations. Moreover, based on JAILDAM , we introduce an end-to-end jailbreak defense framework, JAILDAM-D , as practical application to safeguard target VLMs from attacks. Our key contributions are as follows: 1. Black-box Compatible: We present detection framework that does not require models hidden states, suitable for proprietary VLMs that only expose input-output interfaces. 2. Computationally Efficient: Our pipeline achieves high accuracy without expensive perturbation procedures or data augmentation, supporting faster real-time performance. 3. Policy-Driven Memory with Test-Time Adaptation: We develop memory-based system that does not rely on labeled harmful data; instead, it updates unsafe concept knowledge at inference time. This test-time adaptation step ensures robust handling of new jailbreak strategies that emerge post-deployment."

            "content": "2.1 Jailbreak Detection and Defense on VLM Recently, jailbreaking represents critical concern for safety problem on language models (Chua et al., 2024; Yi et al., 2024; Xing et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025). In the vision-language setting, several jailbreak detection methods have been proposed, which can be classified into four distinct categories: (1) LLM hidden states-based methods, (2) fine-tuning based methods, (3) prompt-based methods, and (4) uncertainty-based method. For jailbreak detection relying on hidden states, Huang et al. (2024) introduces method called NEARSIDE, detection method for VLMs that uses single embedding vector (the attacking direction) from the difference between harmful and benign dataset to efficiently classify harmful and 2 Preprint.

Jiang et al. (2025) identifies safety-aware layers by analyzing hidden activations for safe and unsafe inputs, revealing layers that encode signals indicating whether prompt is unsafe. It then constructs Refusal Vector (RV) in the vocabulary space, capturing the models refusal behavior as reference for detecting unsafe requests. The earliest VLM jailbreak detection is JailGuard (Zhang et al., 2023b), an uncertainty-based framework for identifying jailbreaking and hijacking attacks on LLMs and MLLMs, leveraging the principle that adversarial inputs are inherently less robust and more susceptible to perturbations than benign queries. JailGuard is highly generalized across different attack types, but it takes long time to generate and run different mutates with VLMs. Fine-tuning methods are usually effective in improving safety performance but often require extensive labeled data and computational resources. VLGuard (Zong et al., 2024) employs two fine-tuning strategies: post-hoc fine-tuning, which applies safety alignment to pre-trained VLLMs with minimal helpfulness data, and mixed fine-tuning, which integrates VLGuard data into the original training to ensure safety from the start. Helff et al. (2024) introduces LlavaGuard, VLM-based safety assessment framework designed for dataset curation and content moderation in generative models. LlavaGuard is trained on multimodal safety dataset with human expert annotations, incorporating safety ratings, categories, and rationales to improve its ability to assess and moderate visual data. Wang et al. (2024) introduces prompt-based, novel adaptive shield prompting method: AdaShield, which is designed to defend MLLMs against structure-based jailbreak attacks. The advantage of AdaShield is its ability to dynamically generate defense prompts using Defender LLM that iteratively refines prompts for better security, while it takes longer to call LLMs iteratively. 2.2 Test-time Adaptation Test-time adaptation is the process of adjusting models to testing data that may differ in distribution from the training data. Various approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, which can be broadly categorized into methods that update model parameters, prompt-tuning techniques, and training-free adaptation strategies. One line of research focuses on updating subset of model parameters to adapt to distribution shifts during testing. For instance, Yi et al. (2023) introduces TeCo, test-time optimization framework that enhances video classification robustness by adjusting shallow-layer parameters while adapting batch normalization statistics in deeper layers. This allows the model to maintain stability while improving its generalization to unseen test data. Another prominent approach is prompt-tuning, which leverages learnable prompts to enhance test-time adaptation without modifying the model backbone. Test-Time Prompt Tuning (TPT) (Shu et al., 2022) dynamically fine-tunes learnable prompt for each test sample, optimizing prompt embeddings on the fly to improve zero-shot generalization. 3 Preprint. Under review. Extending this idea, DiffTPT (Feng et al., 2023) improves vision-language models adaptation by incorporating diffusion-based data augmentation into the prompt-tuning process. SwapPrompt (Ma et al., 2023) further advances test-time prompt adaptation by utilizing self-supervised contrastive learning, introducing dual-prompt paradigm where an online prompt is trained dynamically while target prompt is updated through an exponential moving average (EMA) to retain historical knowledge. Despite the effectiveness of prompt tuning, these methods often require computationally expensive backpropagation during inference. To address this, training-free approaches have been explored for efficient adaptation (Li et al., 2025). Training-free Dynamic Adapter (TDA) (Karmanov et al., 2024) achieves test-time adaptation by leveraging dynamic key-value cache that refines pseudo labels for test samples. Instead of optimizing prompts, TDA maintains Positive Cache, which stores high-confidence pseudo labels to refine predictions, and Negative Cache, which identifies absent classes to mitigate label noise. By utilizing simple matrix multiplications instead of backpropagation, TDA significantly improves efficiency while maintaining strong adaptation performance. In our work, we employ the training-free approach while dynamically updating our training-time memory by focusing on harmful concepts that the detector has never encountered before. This is particularly suitable for real-world settings where it is impractical to prepare unsafe data beforehand. By adapting to new and potentially harmful data on the fly, our method enhances the models robustness in unpredictable deployment scenarios. Figure 1: JAILDAM overview (see 3). (A) Training: We encode safe text and images with CLIP, computing attention scores against policy-driven unsafe memory bank. An autoencoder learns to reconstruct these features, linking benign inputs to unsafe conceptswithout explicit harmful data. (B) Inference: For each new input, we compute attention scores and measure the autoencoders reconstruction error; high error indicates potential harm. If similarity to the memory bank is low, JAILDAM updates the least-used concept with residual representation, adapting to new attacks over time."

In 3.2, we introduce novel framework JAILDAM for training jailbreak detector without harmful data by leveraging policy-driven memory representations derived from safety guidelines (3.3). In 3.4, we describe how multimodal safe inputs are encoded and interacted with memories through memory-based attention 4 Preprint. Under review. mechanism, followed by autoencoder-based reconstruction to model safe inputs. To enhance generalization, 3.5 proposes test-time adaptation mechanism that dynamically updates the memory. Finally, 3.6 introduces JAILDAM-D, defense framework that builds upon our detector. An overview of the entire pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. 3.1 Notations and Background for Jailbreak Detection We first introduce the notations for formulating the jailbreak detection problem. Let be an input from either the safe (Psafe) or attack (Pattack) distribution. The models response is (S), with fref as reference for overall unsafe outputs. For gradient-based methods, (S) denotes the gradient of the models output. mutation M(S) perturbs to test uncertainty. And we use for any distance function and threshold τ. Current methods all rely on unsafe inputs in some way. Adashieds iteratively refining defense prompt to minimize unsafe responses likelihood: arg min SPattack [d( (S), fsafe)] (1) JailGuard identifies unsafe prompts by estimating response uncertainty under mutations,which takes long time during testing. For JailGuard, if the expected distance between an original and perturbed response exceeds threshold, the input is classified as an attack: EMPattack [d( (M(S)), (S))] τ (2) GradSafe detects unsafe prompts by finding slices of gradient assuming that gradient slice of unsafe prompts has high similarity while low similarity between unsafe and safe prompts. And it determine the inputs safety level based on the behavior of important gradient slice j. arg max f (cid:16) SPunsafe (cid:104) d( (S), (Sref)) (cid:105) SPsafe (cid:104) d( (S), (Sref)) (cid:105)(cid:17) (3) All three kinds of methods rely on comparing safe and unsafe inputs for jailbreak detection. However,obtaining comprehensive set of unsafe inputs is challenging, as attack strategies continuously evolve. This limitation suggests that jailbreak detection frameworks must incorporate adaptive mechanisms to generalize beyond predefined unsafe distributions. 3.2 Jailbreak Detector Training without Harmful Data Given the limitations of existing detection frameworks and the pressing need for jailbreak detection without access to dedicated jailbreak dataset, we explore novel research problem: How can we determine whether an input is harmful to our model without explicitly training on harmful data? To address this challenge, we propose memory-based detection training framework guided by harmful content policies. This framework serves as tool to analyze the interaction between safe input data and policy constraints during training. Rather than relying on traditional classification model trained on both jailbreak and safe datasets, our approach is formulated as follows: min ESPsafe [L(D(S, ))] , (4) where the detector D(S, ) is trained to evaluate the relationship between safe input with respect to the policy-based memory P. The policy representation encapsulates predefined guidelines for identifying harmful content while also capable of generalizing to unseen inputs. The training process is guided by loss function L, which ensures that the detector aligns with the policy constraints. This formulation ensures that the detector is trained using only safe data while leveraging policy information to generalize to harmful input detection. During test time, we propose test-time adaptation framework where the policy memory is dynamically updated with each new input. Given sequence of test inputs {St}T t=1, we define the harmful score as: H(St) = L(D(St), Pt), (5) We classify St as jailbreak input if H(St) > τ, where τ is predefined threshold. Here, H(St) quantifies the deviation of the input from the safe training data, and the policy Pt is dynamically updated to refine detection over time by update function . s.t. Pt+1 = (Pt, St). 5 Preprint. Under review. 3.3 Memory Bank Generation To build robust safety mechanism, we construct memory bank of unsafe concepts that serve as reference points for detecting harmful content(see Figure 2). The generation of these concepts is crucial for defining the boundaries of unsafe inputs. Given the vast and evolving nature of harmful content, we leverage GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023), large-scale language model with broad knowledge of harmful content policies, to augment and generate structured representations of unsafe memories. Motivated by the idea from how people created interpretable concepts without human annotations in computer vision (Liu et al., 2024b; Oikarinen et al., 2023), we use GPT-4o one time to convert existing harmful content policies into set of structured, highlevel memories.(see Appendix B.1 for detailed generation prompt and concepts example) The process follows structured prompt to extract key concepts per jailbreak category, covering: Important Features: The most crucial characteristics that help recognize the safety issue. Superclasses: Higher-level categories that this issue belongs to. Commonly Seen Contexts: Typical safety issue or elements where this issue appears. Figure 2: The pipeline of concepts and memory bank generation by GPT-4o. For instance, for the Privacy Violence issue, GPT-4o extracts representative concepts such as: Personal data, Unauthorized access, Tracking pixels, Data breaches, Biometric leaks, Social media exposure, Unencrypted transmissions, Phishing attempts. This method provides principled and scalable way to define unsafe memories while maintaining alignment with policy-based safety frameworks. 3.4 Learning Safety Input Our approach leverages an autoencoder (Bank et al., 2023) to model relationships between multimodal safe input and unsafe memories stored in the memory bank. The objective is to encode latent patterns in textual and visual inputs before inference, enabling early detection of potential jailbreak attempts in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). 3.4.1 Memory-Based Attention Feature Encoding After we construct memory bank of unsafe memories categorized into multiple harmful topics, textual and image inputs are processed through encoder, specifically, we use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) since its inherent efficiency characteristic. Then, the embeddings are compared against the memory bank. As shown in equation 6, we compute attention scores between input and memory as feature which quantify how closely an input aligns with stored unsafe memories. These attention features serve as input to the autoencoder: Zmodal = sim(Smodal, Pmodal) = softmax (cid:32) E(Smodal) modal (cid:33) , for modal {text, image} (6) 3.4.2 Autoencoder-Based Representation Learning The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the attention features extracted from multimodal embeddings. By compressing and reconstructing these features, the autoencoder learns 6 Preprint. Under review. latent space that effectively captures the relationship of inputs and our memories. This representation enables better differentiation between benign and harmful content by modeling the distribution of unsafe patterns across both textual and visual modalities. Our training objective is based on reconstruction Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, ensuring that the autoencoder learns to minimize the difference between the input and reconstructed features: min SPsafe [LMSE(D(Z), Z)] , where = concat (cid:0)Ztext, Zimage (cid:1) (7) 3.5 Test-time adaptation Modern deep learning models often face challenges when deployed in real-world settings due to distribution shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD) data (Li et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024b; Qin et al., 2024). Standard approaches require retraining on new data, which is computationally expensive and impractical for real-time adaptation. To address this, we introduce test-time adaptation mechanism that dynamically updates memory to improve models capability on new jailbreak attack without additional training. 3.5.1 Dynamic Concept Refinement via Test-Time Adaptation Our method enables model to adjust its memory in response to novel inputs during inference. The adaptation process consists of four key stages. To identify inputs that necessitate adaptation, we compute max softmax probability scores (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) for both textual and visual features. When the highest probability greater than predefined threshold τ, it signals that the input is likely to have an harmful input. This triggers the adaptation mechanism to replace the old useless memories. During the training stage, each memory in the memory bank maintains usage frequency counter, tracking how often it has been accessed for similarity computations. The jth memory Pt+1,j , with the lowest trigger frequency, is selected for replacement, ensuring that underutilized memories Pt+1,j are dynamically updated with new memory Rt, to reflect the evolving distribution as shown in equation 8 where represent the counter for memories trigger frequency within memory bank. Pt+1,j = Rt, where = arg min C(Pt,j), if Pmax = max exp(zi) exp(zj) > γ. (8) Instead of replacing less relavant memory arbitrarily, we compute residual representation that captures novel variations in the input. For the t-th input St, we retrieve the top-K most relevant memories Pt,i based on similarity to the current input. weighted sum of these memories are computed, where weights correspond to their attention scores. The residual difference between the input feature and this weighted sum is then calculated, isolating novel information that is not well-explained by existing memory as shown in equation 9: Rt = St i=1 wiPt,i, where wi = exp(sim(St, Pt,i)) j=1 exp(sim(St, Pt,j)) (9) Note: As in section 3.4.1, St can be input representation from either the text or image modality, this allowing our memories are updated from both modality. The least frequent concept embedding is replaced with the residual representation, allowing the model to incorporate new patterns while discarding outdated or redundant knowledge. Simultaneously, the frequency counter for this concept is reset to reflect its recent adaptation. This continual refresh process ensures that the memory space remains representative of the data encountered at inference time. 3.5.2 Test-Time Adaptation for Harmful Detection Once the memory space is updated, it serves as the foundation for jailbreak detection. We leverage an autoencoder-based reconstruction mechanism to measure how well the adapted concept space can reconstruct attention features. The reconstruction error serves 7 Preprint. Under review. as proxy for harmful severity, where higher errors indicate harmful inputs that were not well captured by prior training. By dynamically refining memory embeddings, the model generalizes better to new variations encountered during deployment. Furthermore, by continuously updating concepts, the model becomes more resilient to domain shifts and can effectively flag novel inputs as potential anomalies. This introduces novel paradigm for test-time adaptation in memory-based learning, allowing models to remain robust in real-world environments with minimal human supervision. Figure 3: JAILDAM-D (see 3.6), an end-to-end jailbreak defense framework 3.6 Application: An End-to-End Attack Defense Framework Based on our attack detector, JAILDAM . We also construct an end-to-end attack defense framework, denoted as JAILDAM-D (see Figure 3). In this framework, we implement two-stage defense approach. First, incoming instruction is analyzed by the JAILDAM , which evaluates whether the input contains potential attack patterns or harmful content. If the JAILDAM identifies the input as potentially harmful, the framework automatically concatenates specialized defense prompt Td (see Appendix B.2) before the original query. This defense prompt serves to alert the target VLMs about the potential risks and instructs it to refuse answering the harmful request. Conversely, if the input is classified as benign, the query proceeds to the target VLMs without modification, allowing the target model to provide normal assistance."

We evaluate five Jailbreak detection approaches, including both model-agnostic and model-specific methods, using 7B and 13B parameter sizes. From the results in Table 3, we observe that: (1) JAILDAM outperforms the second-best method by an average of 0.10 AUROC across all datasets; (2) Hidden states-based methods perform competitively, with HiddenDetect-13B (Jiang et al., 2025) and GradSafe-7B (Xie et al., 2024) ranking second multiple times and HiddenDetect-7B exceeding JAILDAM by 0.02 AUPRC on MM-SafetyBench; (3) Prompt-based methods LlavaGuard (Helff et al., 2024) and VLGuard (Zong et al., 2024) achieve intermediate results, with 7B versions outperforming their 13B counterparts. Most notably, LlavaGuard-7B exceeds LlavaGuard-13B by approximately 0.4 AUROC in average, likely due to backbone capacity differences; (4) JailGuard-13B (Zhang et al., 2023a), an uncertainty-based method, generally scores below 0.6 AUROC but reaches around 0.8 on JailBreakV-28K. Jailbreak Defense. The Jailbreak Defense task evaluates the comprehensive capacity of defense methods in preventing target VLMs from generating harmful responses. Using the same datasets as in Jailbreak Detection, we test four defense methods compared with 9 Preprint. Under review.

We also assess the defense capacity on vanilla models. Results are shown in Figure 4 and Table 4. Ours findings are following: (1) F1-score: JAILDAM-D outperforms other methods in most settings, except on CogVLM-chat with JailBreakV-28K, where Adashield-A (Wang et al., 2024) achieves perfect score. (2) Precision: Both JAILDAM-D and Adashield-A average 0.98, indicating minimal over-defensiveness. In contrast, Adashield-S (Wang et al., 2024) shows higher over-defensiveness, particularly in LLaVA-1.5-7B and CogVLM-chat-v1.1 with average precision: 0.86 and 0.76, respectively. (3) Recall: JAILDAM-D achieves perfect recall on JailBreakV-28K with GPT-4o-mini (Achiam et al., 2023), but drops to 0.75 with CogVLM-chat, indicating room for improvement in detecting complex jailbreak inputs. Figure 4: The radar diagrams about F1-score of 4 attack defense methods on 4 VLMs. JAILDAM-D outperforms other methods in most settings, except on CogVLM-chat with JailBreakV-28K, where Adashield-A (Wang et al., 2024) achieves perfect score. 4.3 Analysis & Ablation Study 4.3.1 Time Cost Analysis JAILDAM excels with minimal training time. We record the time cost of model training and inference across two tasks. For model training, without loss of generality, we only record training times for methods using 7B backbone on four datasets we introduced in section 4.1.1. From Figure 5, training-free methods such as Adashield-S (Wang et al., Preprint. Under review. 2024), FSD (Gong et al., 2023), HiddenDetect (Jiang et al., 2025) and JailGuard (Zhang et al., 2023a) have zero training cost. Among methods requiring training, JAILDAM achieves the shortest training time at only 15 minutes, compared to Adashield-A which requires approximately 120 minutes. The fine-tuning-based approaches VLGuard (Zong et al., 2024) and LlavaGuard (Helff et al., 2024) require substantially more training time. Figure 5: Time cost on model training, detection task inference, and defense task inference. In here, A-S: Adashield-S, A-A: Adashield-A, JG: JailGuard, HD: HiddenDetect, GS: GradSafe,LG: LlavaGuard, VG: VLGuard JAILDAM outperforms competitors by up to 60x in jailbreak detection inference speed. We measure the average inference time per sample for both tasks: Jailbreak Detection using 7B backbone-based methods and Jailbreak Defense with LLaVA-1.5-7B as the target model. In Jailbreak Detection, JAILDAM demonstrates significantly fastest inferenceapproximately 60 times faster than the second-fastest model, VLGuard (Zong et al., 2024). However, in Jailbreak Defense, JAILDAM-D is the second fastest, trailing Adashield-S by approximately 1.2 seconds. This difference may be attributed to the varying token lengths generated by target VLMs. 4.3.2 Ablation on Concepts Size of Each Category Optimal concept pool size balances coverage and efficiency at 20-40 concepts. To explore the effectiveness of varying concept sizes for each harmful category in jailbreak detection, we conduct ablation experiment in the Jailbreak Detection setting, testing 8 different sizes ranging from 5 to 100 concepts. As shown in Figure 6, we observe sharp performance increase when the concept size increases from 5 to 15. We see that expanding the concept pool provides broader coverage of possible harmful content types. The performance trend flattens between sizes 15 and 40, with slight performance decrease observe from 40 to 100 concepts. As memory size grows, the performance of effectiveness wont increase. Figure 6: AUROC of detection task on different concept sizes 4.3.3 Ablation on Test-time Adaptation Test-time adaptation significantly boosts JAILDAM performance. Based on our choice of concept size of 40 for each harmful content category (see 7), we conduct an ablation study on the 11 Preprint. Under review. FS MS W/O Adaptation Metric effectiveness of test-time adaptation using the Jailbreak Detection setting. We evaluate the AUROC and AUPRC of JAILDAM both with and without the adaptation function during the testing stage. As shown in Table 5, we observe consistent improvements across all three datasets, with average increases of 0.05 in AUROC and 0.08 in AUPRC. These improvements demonstrate that the test-time adaptation helps JAILDAM to enrich its memory bank, enabling better coverage of previously unseen harmful scenarios.

            "title": "A Details of Related Work",
            "content": "A.1 Jailbreak Detection on VLM For jailbreak detection relying on hidden states, Huang et al. (2024) introduces method called NEARSIDE, detection method for VLMs that uses single embedding vector (the attacking direction) from the difference between harmful and benign dataset to efficiently classify harmful and benign inputs without requiring multiple inferences or expensive computations. Jiang et al. (2025) identifies safety-aware layers by analyzing hidden activations for safe and unsafe inputs, revealing layers that encode signals indicating whether prompt is unsafe. It then constructs Refusal Vector (RV) in the vocabulary space, capturing the models refusal behavior as reference for detecting unsafe requests. 15 Preprint. Under review. The earliest VLM jailbreak detection is JailGuard (Zhang et al., 2023b), an uncertainty-based framework for identifying jailbreaking and hijacking attacks on LLMs and MLLMs, leveraging the principle that adversarial inputs are inherently less robust and more susceptible to perturbations than benign queries. JailGuard is highly generalized across different attack types, but it takes long time to generate and run different mutates with VLMs. Fine-tuning methods are usually effective in improving safety performance but often require extensive labeled data and computational resources. VLGuard (Zong et al., 2024) employs two fine-tuning strategies: post-hoc fine-tuning, which applies safety alignment to pre-trained VLLMs with minimal helpfulness data, and mixed fine-tuning, which integrates VLGuard data into the original training to ensure safety from the start. Helff et al. (2024) introduces LlavaGuard, VLM-based safety assessment framework designed for dataset curation and content moderation in generative models. LlavaGuard is trained on multimodal safety dataset with human expert annotations, incorporating safety ratings, categories, and rationales to improve its ability to assess and moderate visual data. Wang et al. (2024) introduces prompt-based, novel adaptive shield prompting method: AdaShield, which is designed to defend MLLMs against structure-based jailbreak attacks. The advantage of AdaShield is its ability to dynamically generate defense prompts using Defender LLM that iteratively refines prompts for better security, while it takes longer to call LLMs iteratively. A.2 Test-time Adaptation One line of research focuses on updating subset of model parameters to adapt to distribution shifts during testing. For instance, Yi et al. (2023) introduces TeCo, test-time optimization framework that enhances video classification robustness by adjusting shallowlayer parameters while adapting batch normalization statistics in deeper layers. This allows the model to maintain stability while improving its generalization to unseen test data. Another prominent approach is prompt-tuning, which leverages learnable prompts to enhance test-time adaptation without modifying the model backbone. Test-Time Prompt Tuning (TPT) (Shu et al., 2022) dynamically fine-tunes learnable prompt for each test sample, optimizing prompt embeddings on the fly to improve zero-shot generalization. Extending this idea, DiffTPT (Feng et al., 2023) improves vision-language models adaptation by incorporating diffusion-based data augmentation into the prompt-tuning process. SwapPrompt (Ma et al., 2023) further advances test-time prompt adaptation by utilizing self-supervised contrastive learning, introducing dual-prompt paradigm where an online prompt is trained dynamically while target prompt is updated through an exponential moving average (EMA) to retain historical knowledge. Despite the effectiveness of prompt tuning, these methods often require computationally expensive backpropagation during inference. To address this, training-free approaches have been explored for efficient adaptation (Li et al., 2025). Training-free Dynamic Adapter (TDA) (Karmanov et al., 2024) achieves test-time adaptation by leveraging dynamic key-value cache that refines pseudo labels for test samples. Instead of optimizing prompts, TDA maintains Positive Cache, which stores high-confidence pseudo labels to refine predictions, and Negative Cache, which identifies absent classes to mitigate label noise. By utilizing simple matrix multiplications instead of backpropagation, TDA significantly improves efficiency while maintaining strong adaptation performance. In our work, we employ the training-free approach while dynamically updating our training-time memory by focusing on harmful concepts that the detector has never encountered before. This is particularly suitable for real-world settings where it is impractical to prepare unsafe data beforehand. By adapting to new and potentially harmful data on the fly, our method enhances the models robustness in unpredictable deployment scenarios. Preprint. Under review.

            "content": "C.1 Details of Each Datasets We evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets from prominent prior works, including MM-SafetyBench (Yu et al., 2024b), FigStep (Gong et al., 2023), MM-Vet (Yu et al., 2023), AdaShield (Wang et al., 2024), HiddenDetect (Jiang et al., 2025), and the latest VLM jailbreak benchmark, JailbreakV28k (Luo et al., 2024). The following paragraphs provides an overview of the datasets utilized in our comprehensive evaluation: MM-SafetyBench. This paper finds that MLLMs can be compromised by query-relevant images, similar to malicious text inputs. To address this, the authors propose MMSafetyBench, framework for evaluating MLLM vulnerabilities to image-based manipulations. They compile dataset with 13 scenarios and 5,040 text-image pairs for safety-critical assessments. FigStep. FigStep is black-box jailbreaking algorithm that exploits vision-language models (VLMs) by injecting harmful instructions through images and using benign text prompts to bypass safety policies. Experiments show that VLMs are vulnerable to such attacks, emphasizing the need for stronger safety alignments between visual and textual modalities. To support further research, the authors release SafeBench, dataset of 500 questions covering 10 topics restricted by OpenAI and Meta policies. JailbreakV-28k. JailBreakV-28K is benchmark designed to evaluate whether jailbreak techniques effective on Large Language Models (LLMs) can also compromise Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It assesses MLLM robustness against diverse jailbreak attacks by leveraging 2,000 malicious queries, generating 20,000 text-based jailbreak prompts from advanced LLM attacks, and incorporating 8,000 image-based jailbreak inputs from recent MLLM exploits. The dataset comprises 28,000 test cases spanning various adversarial scenarios. MM-Vet. MM-Vet is an evaluation benchmark designed to assess large multimodal models (LMMs) on complex multimodal tasks. It addresses key challenges in benchmarking, such as structuring evaluations, designing robust metrics, and providing insights beyond simple performance rankings. MM-Vet defines six core vision-language (VL) capabilities and evaluates 16 key integrations of these capabilities. The benchmark includes 218 samples, covering diverse range of multimodal reasoning tasks. C.2 Dataset Statistic The pie chart (see Figure 10) illustrates the distribution of our experimental test set, comprising 528 jailbreak samples and 218 benign samples. 18 Preprint. Under review.
