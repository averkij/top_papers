            "title": "INTRODUCTION",
            "content": "The remarkable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and OpenAI o1 (Schulman et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; OpenAI, 2024b) heavily rely on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022b) or Inference Scaling Law (Snell et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024; Lightman et al., 2023). Reward models play pivotal role in both techniques. In RLHF, reward models serve as proxies for human values, providing feedback on generated text, which helps align language models (policy models) during training (Ouyang et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2024). In Inference Scaling Law, reward models are used to select the best response from set of candidates based on predicted rewards (Wu et al., 2024; Snell et al., 2024). Despite their significance, benchmarks for reward models remain under-explored compared to the rapid advancements in aligned language model evaluation, namely the policy model (Hendrycks et al., 2020; bench authors, 2023; Chiang et al., 2024; Hendrycks et al., 2021). To conduct faithful and systematical evaluation, an ideal benchmark for reward models should adhere to three key principles: 1) Assessing Reward Models Sensitivity to Subtle Changes: faithful reward model should sensitively distinguish subtle changes and assign higher reward to the correct response. For example, in Table 1, Response 1 and Response 2 differ by only one word but express completely different meanings, requiring the reward model to focus on content quality. 2) Assessing Reward Models Robustness against Style Biases: strong reward model should avoid being misled by spurious correlations between style and content and consistently reject factually incorrect responses, regardless of style. For example, in Table 1, Response 3 is factually incorrect but longer than Response 1, which could mislead the reward model into assigning higher reward to Response 3. 3) Correlating with Policy Models: good reward model benchmark should highly correlate with the performance of the aligned language model (the policy model). This would make it reliable proxy for selecting the best reward model for alignment. Recent efforts (Lambert et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have made progress by constructing benchmarks from existing preference datasets. Typically, these benchmarks involve 1 Paper Under Review Table 1: The three different responses to prompt about Schrodingers cat have rewards predicted by reward model LxzGordon/URM-LLaMa-3-8B. Resp #1 provides the correct information, while Resp #2 and #3 contain factual errors. The reward model struggles to discern the nuanced but critical difference between Resp #1 and Resp #2 and tends to prefer Resp #3 due to its longer length. Prompt: What happened to Schrodingers cat? Response Content Resp. #1 Correct Resp. #2 Wrong Resp. #3 Wrong Related Fact Schrodingers cat illustrates quantum superposition, where cat in sealed box with radioactive atom is metaphorically both alive and dead until observed. Schrodingers cat illustrates quantum entanglement, where cat in sealed box with radioactive atom is metaphorically both alive and dead until observed. Schrodingers cat illustrates quantum entanglement, where cat in sealed box with radioactive atom is metaphorically both alive and dead until observed, highlighting the paradoxical nature of quantum mechanics. Schrodingers cat demonstrates quantum superposition, not quantum entanglement. Quantum superposition involves the cat being both alive and dead until observed, whereas quantum entanglement refers to two particles linked so that the state of one affects the other, which is not the core concept of Schrodingers cat. Reward 4. 4.47 4.66 providing prompt and two responses and asking the reward model to assign higher reward to the better response. However, to reduce construction costs, they often use stronger LM to generate the better response and weaker LM for the worse response. This design makes it difficult to assess reward models sensitivity to subtle changes, as the responses are generated by different LMs. This could also lead to reward models hacking with the style of powerful LMs, failing to assess the reward models ability to resist style biases. These issues can result in low correlation with the aligned language models performance (Ivison et al., 2024), highlighting the need for more refined benchmark. To this end, we propose new benchmark, RM-BENCH, towards evaluating reward models ability to distinguish subtle changes and resist style biases. In particular, 1) To evaluate reward models sensitivity to subtle changes, we generate both the chosen and rejected responses using the same LM, gpt-4o (OpenAI, 2024a), with the rejected responses containing subtle errors introduced through techniques like jailbreaking or multi-sampling. 2) To assess robustness against style biases, we use style-controlled prompts to generate response variants in different styles, including concise, detailed, and markdown-formatted. 3) Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show that RMBENCH has high correlation with policy model performance after Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) fine-tuning. Finally, we evaluate nearly 40 various reward models on RM-BENCH, including sequenceclassification reward models, multi-objective reward models, and chat models trained with Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) (Cui et al., 2023; Adler et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2023). Our results highlight several key findings: 1) Substantial progress is still needed in improving reward model performance. Even the giant reward model, such as Nemotron-340B-Reward (Adler et al., 2024), struggle on RM-BENCH, achieving only 69.5% accuracy. Compared to random guessing (50% accuracy), this result is still far from satisfactory. 2) Style biases deserve more attention in faithfully evaluating reward models. When predicting rewards, reward models are easily influenced by response style, deviating from the substance of the response. State-of-the-art reward models, such as Skyword-Reward (Liu & Zeng, 2024), fail to resist style biases, achieving only 46.6% accuracy, falling short of random guess accuracy under style interference. 3) DPO models demonstrate more potential in reward modeling. The DPO models compared to its sequence-classification counterparts, demonstrate better performance on RM-BENCH, suggesting its potential as candidate for reward models."

            "content": "Policy Model In the context of language modeling, the policy model refers to the language model being aligned. It is trained to generate responses given prompt x. In this work, we use the terms aligned language model and policy model interchangeably. 2 Paper Under Review Reward Model reward model serves as proxy for the environment, providing reward signal to evaluate the agents actions. Within the context of language models, the reward model functions as text classifier, predicting the reward of response based on given prompt. Formally, the reward signal is given by: = Rψ(x, y) (1) where is the prompt, is the response, and ψ denotes the parameters of the reward model. The reward model is typically trained on preference dataset Dpref, consisting of pairs (x, yc, yr), where yc is the chosen response and yr is the rejected response. The model is trained to assign higher reward to yc than to yr, optimizing the following objective: Lpref = E(x,yc,yr)Dpref [log σ(Rψ(x, yc) Rψ(x, yr))] This objective ensures that the reward model learns to identify responses that align better with human preferences. (2) Multi-Objective Reward Model In real-world scenarios, human preferences in language modeling span multiple dimensions, such as correctness, readability, and verbosity. Single-objective reward models often struggle to capture this complexity. To address this, the multi-objective reward model is introduced, which provides multiple reward signals from different perspectives. Formally, the multi-objective reward model is represented as vector-valued function: Rψ(x, y) RK (3) where is the number of distinct reward signals (e.g., readability, correctness, verbosity). Each component of the reward vector captures specific aspect of the response quality, allowing the model to make more nuanced evaluations of language model outputs. DPO Model The Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) algorithm optimizes the policy model directly using implicit reward signals from itself, instead of relying on distinct reward model. Specifically, the implicit reward signal in DPO is derived from the probabilities of the policy model πθ(yx), the probabilities of reference model πref(yx), regularization constant β, and partition function Z(x): Rψ(x, y) = log πθ(yx) πref(yx) Here, πθ(yx) and πref(yx) represent the probabilities assigned by the policy model and the reference model, respectively. Typically, the reference model is the base model where the policy model is trained on top of it. If the reference model is unavailable, we assume πref(yx) = 1, simplifying the reward to depend only on the policy models probabilities. The partition function Z(x), which is only related to the input prompt x, can be omitted when comparing rewards between responses. + β log Z(x) (4) Reward Model Evaluation We evaluate reward models by framing the task as classification problem, following prior work (Lambert et al., 2024). Specifically, given tuple (x, yc, yr), where is the prompt, yc is the chosen response, and yr is the rejected response, the reward model predicts whether yc is better than yr. If the reward model assigns higher reward to yc than to yr, the prediction is considered correct; otherwise, it is incorrect. We use accuracy as the evaluation metric, calculated as follows: Accuracy = 1 (cid:88) [Rψ(x, yc) > Rψ(x, yr)] (5) (x,yc,yr)D where I() is the indicator function, and denotes the evaluation dataset. For multi-objective reward models, accuracy is determined by element-wise comparison of the reward vectors."

            "title": "3 RM-BENCH CONSTRUCTION",
            "content": "In this section, we describe the construction of RM-BENCH, benchmark designed to evaluate reward models. Following Reward Bench (Lambert et al., 2024), RM-BENCH covers four key domains, namely, Chat, Code, Math, and Safety. These domains encompass wide variety of realworld scenarios, including open-domain chat, reasoning tasks, and safety-critical situations. 3 Paper Under Review Prompt Prompt LLM LLM Response 1 # .

LLM yc yr (3.b) Safety-Should-Refuse Figure 1: The construction process of chosen response yc and rejected response yr for each domain in RM-BENCH (Section 3.1 to 3.3). LLM we used here is gpt-4o. Wary LLM is the language model gpt-4o with special over-cautious system prompt. Unc. LLM is the uncensored language model Llama-3.1-8B-Lexi-Uncensored-V2 which is used to generate harmful responses. which used to generate the refusal response for superficially alarming but benign prompts. For each domain, we construct dataset of (x, yc, yr) tuples, where is the prompt, yc is the chosen response, and yr is the rejected response. Both responses are generated by the same powerful language models. Additionally, we generate style-controlled variants of both chosen and rejected responses to assess reward model biases related to stylistic features. The correctness of the responses is verified by human annotators to ensure high-quality data across all domains. The following sections detail the process of collecting prompts x, generating chosen and rejected responses yc and yr to form test tuple (x, yc, yr) for each domain. Figure 1 provides an overview of the construction process for each domain. 3.1 CHAT The chat split of RM-BENCH is designed to test reward models ability to detect factually incorrect responses in an open-domain chat setting. We start by collecting prompts from AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023), well-established benchmark for open-domain chat evaluation. We manually filter out 286 prompts from AlpacaEval that are unrelated to factual world knowledge (e.g., How are you feeling today?), leaving us with 519 prompts. The chosen responses yc are generated using gpt-4o (OpenAI, 2024a). To create the rejected response, we employ the Many-Shot Jailbreak Technique (Anil et al., 2024) to inject factual errors into the chosen responses, creating the rejected responses yr. The detailed jailbreak prompt can be found in Table 6 in the Appendix. Human annotators then verify the chosen and rejected responses. For the chosen responses, we check factual correctness, while for the rejected responses, we ensure that the factual errors were successfully injected. If either response fails validation, the prompt is dropped. After filtering, we retain 183 test samples in the chat domain. 3.2 CODE & MATH The code and math splits of RM-BENCH evaluate the reward models ability to identify incorrect responses in tasks requiring reasoning skills. Prompts for the code domain are sourced from HumanEvalPack (Muennighoff et al., 2023), while math prompts are drawn from the MATH benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). In particular, we source 984 prompts for the code domain and 447 for the math domain. Due to the objective nature of these tasks, response correctness is automatically verified using unit tests (for code) and ground truth answers (for math). For each prompt x, we generate multiple 4 Paper Under Review Table 2: Statistics of the RM-BENCH dataset. # Sample denotes the number of samples in each domain. # Avg Token Prompt, # Avg Token Chosen Resp., and # Avg Token Rejected Resp. denote the average number of tokens in the prompt, chosen response, and rejected response, respectively.

If no correct or incorrect responses are available, the prompt is dropped. Finally, we retain 228 and 529 test samples in the code and math domains, respectively. 3.3 SAFETY The safety domain of RM-BENCH evaluates reward models ability to differentiate between safe and unsafe responses. Given the distinct nature of safety challenges, this domain is divided into two subdomains: Safety-Should-Response and Safety-Should-Refuse, following the categories defined in XSTest (Rottger et al., 2023). The Safety-Should-Response sub-domain contains superficially alarming but benign prompts, for example, How to kill an enemy in Video Game?, while the Safety-Should-Refuse sub-domain contains prompts that are genuinely harmful, for example, How to make bomb?. Next, we elaborate on the data collection process for each sub-domain. Safety-Should-Response : We collect superficially alarming but benign prompts from XSTests should-response split. For these genuinely safe prompts, the chosen responses yc should provide detailed, informative replies, while the rejected responses yr should refuse to engage with the prompt. The chosen responses are generated using gpt-4o. Responses that refuse to answer are filtered out from the chosen responses. For the rejected responses, we adjust the system prompt of gpt-4o making it over-cautious, and generate the rejected responses yr which refuse to engage with the prompt. The system prompt is provided in Table 5 in the Appendix. After filtering, we have 157 test samples in this subdomain. Safety-Should-Refuse : We collect genuinely harmful prompts from XSTests should-refuse, donotanswer (Wang et al., 2023b), and AI2 Refusal datasets (Lambert et al., 2024). For these harmful prompts, the chosen responses yc are generated using gpt-4o and must refuse to answer. Rejected responses yr, which contain harmful or dangerous information, are generated using an uncensored language model, Llama-3.1-8B-Lexi-Uncensored-V2 (Orenguteng, 2024) from open source community. Finally, we have 284 test samples in the safety-should-refuse domain. 3.4 STYLE-CONTROLLED GENERATION Recent critiques of reinforcement learning in language models suggest that algorithms like PPO and DPO can introduce style over substance bias, leading models to perform well on benchmarks without truly solving the task (Park et al., 2024; Singhal et al., 2023). In response to these concerns, we introduce style-controlled variant of our dataset to probe reward model biases toward response style. We follow the style-control design from Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024; LMSYS, 2024), considering two style features: Length and Markdown formatting. Responses are categorized into three types based on these features: 1) y: Short, concise responses containing only key information. 2) yL: Detailed responses in plain text. 3) yL,M: Detailed, informative responses with Markdown formatting. 5 Paper Under Review and yL,M gpt4o, as the language model well aligned with human preference, by default, tends to generate detailed, well-formatted responses. As result, the chosen and rejected responses collected in Sections 3.1 to 3.3 can be viewed as yL,M , we prompt gpt-4o to remove the Markdown formatting from the responses yL,M without altering the content. For concise responses and yL . For each prompt x, this process generates three chosen responses and three rejected responses across the different style features. This results in style-controlled dataset, Dstyle = {(x, y(s) )}, where {, L, (L,M)}. Examples from RM-BENCH are provided in Tables 7 to 11 in the Appendix. The data statistics are summarized in Table 2. , we prompt gpt-4o to summarize the content of yL . To create plain-text responses yL and yL,M and and yL , y(s) 3.5 METRICS For each prompt x, we compare the chosen and rejected responses across three style levels: concise y, detailed yL, and detailed with Markdown formatting yL,M. This allows us to evaluate reward models ability to distinguish between chosen and rejected responses independently of stylistic differences. To systematically evaluate reward models and minimize interference from style, we organize the results into 33 matrix, referred to as the Style-Substance Evaluation Matrix. Figure 2 provides an example of this matrix for the sfairXC/FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-v0.1 reward model in the chat domain. The rows represent chosen responses with different styles, and the columns represent rejected responses with different styles. Diagonal elements compare responses with the same style, while off-diagonal elements compare responses with differing levels of detail and formatting. From this matrix, we derive three accuracy metrics: Easy Accuracy: The average of the lower triangle, represents the reward models ability to detect substance when style cues are present. Normal Accuracy: The average of the diagonal elements, reflects the models ability to assess substance when both responses share the same style. Hard Accuracy: The average of the upper triangle, measuring the models capacity to identify the better response based purely on substance, even when the rejected response has more favorable style. These metrics are calculated for the four domains: Chat, Safety, Code, and Math, resulting in domainspecific metrics such as Chat Normal Accuracy or Safety Hard Accuracy. Additionally, we compute the Average Accuracy across all domains to provide an overall performance metric for the reward model."

Compared to random-guessing baseline (50%), the results are far from satisfactory, indicating significant room for improvement. 2) Style Bias is Serious: Hard Accuracy on RM-BENCH is significantly lower than Normal Accuracy, with most reward models failing to exceed random-level performance (50%). This reveals that many existing reward models are more akin to style preference models, favoring well-structured responses over those with stronger substantive content. Our findings highlight the urgent need to mitigate style bias and improve the robustness of reward models. 3) Math & Code are Challenging: Math and code domains pose the greatest challenges for reward models, with even average accuracy struggling to exceed random-level performance (50%). In terms of Hard Accuracy, reward models perform even worse. The state-of-the-art Skywork-Reward-Llama-3.1-8B achieves only 28.4% and 30.7% in Math and Code, respectively (see Table 14 and Table 15 in the Appendix). This performance even lags behind the randomguessing baseline (50%), indicating current reward models may lead the policy model astray in these domains. 4.2 DPO MODEL VS. SEQUENCE CLASSIFIER In this section, we aim to compare two widely adopted reward modeling paradigms, including the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) models and sequence classifier. DPO is popular rewardmodel free training method with preference dataset, where the policy model is directly optimized with implicit reward signals from itself. Since both the DPO model and the sequence classifier reward model can be trained on the same preference dataset, we conduct an ablation study to assess the effectiveness of using the DPO model as reward model. Specifically, we use the sequence classifier and DPO models from the tulu-v2.5 series (Ivison et al., 2023), trained on preference datasets such as HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a), StackExchange (Lambert et al., 2023), Chatbot Arena 2023 (Zheng et al., 2023), and Nectar (Zhu 7 Paper Under Review Table 4: Average accuracy comparison of DPO models and sequence classifiers trained with different preference datasets on RM-BENCH.

We evaluate these sequence classifiers on RM-BENCH. As for their DPO counterparts, we evaluate their average accuracy both with and without the reference model tulu-2-13b on RM-BENCH. The results are shown in Table 4. As Table 4 shows, DPO models outperform their sequence classifier counterparts when trained on the same preference dataset. We hypothesize that this improvement stems from the influence of the reference model, as equation 4 shows, where the reward signal from the DPO model is scaled by the reference models signal. The data supports this hypothesis, as we observe significant performance drop when the reference model is unavailable, showing the critical role the reference model plays. 4.3 MULTI-OBJECTIVE REWARD MODELS Multi-objective reward models have recently been proposed to mitigate style bias by separating correctness from factors such as verbosity. To assess how well these models achieve this separation, we evaluate Nemotron-4-340B-Reward (Wang et al., 2024) on RM-BENCH. Given response and the corresponding prompt x, Nemotron-4-340B-Reward provides both correctness score and verbosity score. Figure 3 shows scatter plot of responses , and yL based on their correctness and verbosity scores. Ideally, multi-objective reward model should assign higher correctness scores to chosen responses (yc) over rejected responses (yr), irrespective of style. Verbose responses (yL) should consistently receive higher verbosity scores compared to concise responses (y), independent of correctness. Thus, an ideal reward model would place in the bottom left, yL in the upper right, and yL in the bottom right quadrant, , , yL in the upper left. However, Figure 3 shows that this separation in correctness is only evident in the safety domain, where chosen responses significantly differ from rejected ones (e.g., chosen responses refuse to engage with harmful prompts, while rejected responses provide harmful information). This suggests that reward models are more aware of the harmful content in responses. In contrast, in more complex domains like math and code, the reward model fails to detect subtle differences between chosen and rejected responses. This failure results in significant overlap of chosen and rejected responses in the scatter plot, indicating that Nemotron-340B-Reward struggles to disentangle correctness from other factors in these domains. In sum, while multi-objective reward models succeed in simpler cases, they face difficulties in domains requiring more nuanced distinctions. 8 Paper Under Review"

            "title": "5 CORRELATION WITH POLICY MODEL",
            "content": "The primary objective of reward models is to improve policy model performance. Thus, good reward model benchmark should exhibit positive correlation with policy model performance. In this section, we investigate how reward model performance on RM-BENCH correlates with policy model performance. To this end, we use reward models and their corresponding policy models from the Tulu-v2.5 series (Ivison et al., 2023) for our experiments. Specifically, these four reward models are trained on different preference datasets, including HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a), StackExchange (Lambert et al., 2023), Chatbot Arena 2023 (Zheng et al., 2023), and Nectar (Zhu et al., 2023). All datasets are sampled to 60k examples to ensure comparable training data size. The policy models are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO; Schulman et al., 2017), with the same training data and hyperparameters. 5.1 STYLE-CONTROLLED CORRELATION First, we examine how reward model performance on RM-BENCH correlates with policy model performance on style-controlled evaluation. Specifically, we investigate whether reward models that perform well with Hard Accuracy of RM-BENCH lead to better policy model performance in style-controlled settings. To test this, we use Arena-Hard-Auto (Zheng et al., 2023) as the style-controlled evaluation for policy models. This benchmark incorporates length and markdown as style features, similar to RM-BENCH. We define the policy models style-control score as the relative drop in performance on style-controlled evaluations compared to evaluations without style control. higher style-control score indicates that the policy model is less biased towards stylistic features. Figure 4: Line-chart of the policy model style-bias score and the reward model hard accuracy on RM-BENCH chat. For reward models, we use Hard Accuracy from the Chat domain of RM-BENCH as the evaluation metric, as it directly measures the models ability to prioritize substance over style, which is critical for reducing style bias. As shown in Figure 4, increasing hard accuracy on RM-BENCH is associated with significant improvement in the policy models style-control score. This suggests that reward models emphasizing substance over style result in policy models with reduced style bias. 5.2 DOWNSTREAM TASK CORRELATION Next, we investigate the correlation between reward model performance on RM-BENCH and policy model performance across various downstream tasks, including math, code, and safety. Math tasks are evaluated using GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) and Big Bench Hard (bench authors, 2023; Suzgun et al., 2022). Code tasks are evaluated using HumanEval+ (Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2024a) and MBPP+ (Austin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2024a). Safety tasks are evaluated on ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) and XSTest (Rottger et al., 2024). As for the reward models, we select metrics based on the nature of the tasks. For math and safety tasks, we use Hard Accuracy, as correctness is crucial, and these tasks often involve varied text styles that require distinguishing between substance and style. 9 Figure 5: Correlation between reward model perf. on RM-BENCH and policy model perf. on downstream tasks. Paper Under Review For code tasks, language models tend to generate style-consistent text (particularly in markdown format), because much of the training data from sources like GitHub and StackOverflow is in markdown. Due to this, we use Normal Accuracy to better align with the inherent consistency in code style. To further demonstrate the correlation, we first normalize policy model performance by comparing it to the base SFT model tulu-2-13b (Ivison et al., 2023). Reward model scores on RM-BENCH are standardized using the mean and standard deviation of their performance. We then plot the reward model performance on RM-BENCH against policy model performance across downstream tasks (Figure 5). The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.55 (p = 0.07), indicating moderate positive correlation trending toward significance. In comparison, RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024) reports Pearson correlation of = 0.21 (p = 0.51) (see Section in the appendix). This highlights that RM-BENCH takes step forward toward better-correlated benchmark for reward model evaluation."

            "content": "Reward Models in LLM era Reward models are designed to provide reward signals based on specific preferences. In the LLM era, reward models are generally used to as proxy for human preferences. It provides reward feedback to the policy model, namely the language model, to guide its alignment training process (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; Dong et al., 2024). They are typically constructed upon large pre-trained language models by adding classification head to predict the reward of response given prompt (Zhu et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Liu & Zeng, 2024; Adler et al., 2024). To align them with certain criteria, such as promoting helpfulness and harmlessness, they undergo fine-tuning using preference datasets (Bai et al., 2022a; Wu et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023). By incorporating guidance from these well-tuned reward models, policy models would benefit from it, enhancing their performance across various downstream tasks, such as open-domain chat (Nakano et al., 2021), math reasoning (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023a) and image generation (Lee et al., 2023). Reward Model Evaluation Ensuring faithful benchmark against reward models is crucial as it directly affects the efficacy of preference alignment (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a) and the fairness of performance evaluation (Zeng et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b). However, studies have shown that when using LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng et al., 2023), models may be vulnerable to surface styles, e.g. text length rather than the underlying factuality (Durmus et al., 2022; Dubois et al., 2024; Chiang et al., 2024). This underscores the vulnerability of reward models to spurious correlations, potentially leading to deceptive performance. While previous studies (Lambert et al., 2024) lack potential countermeasures, in this study, we bridge this gap by explicitly integrating style control into the dataset curation process. Our benchmark is designed to authentically reflect the performance of reward models and establish high correlation with policy model performance."

            "title": "7 CONCLUSION",
            "content": "In this paper, we introduce RM-BENCH, benchmark for evaluating reward models that focuses on assessing subtlety and style. Extensive experiments show that RM-BENCH demonstrates strong correlation with policy model performance, making it reliable reference for selecting reward models for language model alignment. We evaluate nearly 40 reward models on RM-BENCH, finding that even state-of-the-art reward models struggle to exceed random-level performance under the interference of style bias, indicating significant room for improvement and the urgent need to mitigate style bias. Besides, experiments results bring insights that Direct Preference Optimization models outperform sequence-classification reward models, suggesting DPOs potential for serving as better reward model. In sum, we hope that RM-BENCH will encourage the community to critically examine the design of reward model benchmarks and inspire the development of more accurate and systematic evaluations in the future, such as incorporating additional style features and high-quality response pairs. 10 Paper Under Review"

            "content": "A LIMITATIONS OF RM-BENCH Limited Coverage of Bias Types Although RM-BENCH covers two types of bias including Length and Markdown, it does not cover all types of bias. For example, we found that in code tasks, tulu-v2.5-13b-uf-rm significantly prefers the response that only contains the code snippet without any explanation. This indicates that the model is biased towards the code snippet, which is not covered in RM-BENCH. Besides, reward models may also be biased towards some specific words or phrases, such as think step by step, which is not covered in RM-BENCH. All these possible unexplored biases could lead to the reward model hacking the benchmark, and we leave them as future work to explore. Limited Correlation with Policy Models Although we have shown that RM-BENCH has high correlation under the controlled experiments with same base model tulu-2-13b under the same training algorithm PPO and the same hyperparameters in Section 5.1, the correlation may not hold in real-world scenarios where the policy model is trained with different base models, training algorithms, and hyperparameters. For example, the post-training process of some models like LLaMA-3.1-405B is mixed by both PPO and DPO, which may lead to different correlation with the reward models. It is worth noting that the reward model is crucial but not the only factor that affects the post-training process of the pre-trained language models."

POTENTIAL BIAS INTRODUCED BY GPT-4O Since our benchmark is largely constructed based on the responses generated by gpt-4o, reward model build upon gpt-4o may be biased to prefer its own style. First, we would like to clarify that since none of the tested reward models are based on gpt-4o, the bias introduced by gpt-4o is not directly reflected in the results. Second, it is common practice to employ the gpt-4 series model to construct benchmarks and judge responses from LMs, as it is one of the most powerful LMs available (Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2024). In the future, we will further expand the benchmark by including responses generated by more language models, such as Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama-3.1-405B, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, to reduce the potential bias introduced by single language model."

To keep up with the pace of language model development, an efficient and scalable data construction method is essential. Our data construction method is highly scalable and can be easily extended to include new language models and new domains. New Language Models: To construct RM-BENCH with new released language model, we only need to repeat the pipeline in Section 3.1 to 3.3 with the new language model. There are no specific requirements for the language model, as long as it can generate text responses to the prompts. New Domains: To include new domains in RM-BENCH, the detailed construction process is as follows: 1) For Domain with Ground Truth: If the prompts (e.g., reasoning task) have ground truth answer, and the correctness of the responses can be automatically evaluated. We can directly follow the pipeline of Math & Code domain in Section 3.2 to construct the dataset. 2) For Domain without Ground Truth: If the prompts (e.g., chat task) do not have ground truth answer, we can 15 Paper Under Review follow the pipeline of Chat domain in Section 3.1 to construct the dataset.

We also investigate the correlation between the reward model performance on RM-BENCH and the policy model performance on the Alpaca Eval. We defined the length-control scores as the relative win-rate (w.r.t GPT-4-0116) increase of the policy model on the length-controlled evaluation compared to the evaluation without length control. The higher the length-control score, the better the length-control ability of the model. Since the Alpaca Eval only focuses on the length bias, we leverage the reward model accuracy when comparing concise chosen response with the verbose rejected response ylength on RM-BENCH chat as the evaluation metric. As Figure 6 shows, along with the increase of the reward model accuracy on RM-BENCH, the policy model lengthcontrol score is significantly improved. This indicates that the reward model that performs well on identifying substance over length leads to policy model that is less biased towards the length.

In Best-of-N, the reward model is used to select the optimal response from multiple generated outputs. Since the Best-of-N strategy is primarily applied to reasoning tasks, such as code and math, we selected HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MATH (Cobbe et al., 2021) for evaluation, the tested policy model is tulu-2-13b. Figure 8: Correlation between reward model performance on RM-BENCH and policy model performance with Best-of-N strategy, including code (left) and math (right). The results are shown in Figure 8. The y-axis represents the relative accuracy improvement under the Best-of-N strategy compared to the greedy decoding baseline, while the x-axis shows the reward model performance on RM-BENCH. The results indicate that as reward model performance improves on RM-BENCH, the Best-of-N strategy yields better policy model performance in reasoning tasks. This suggests that RM-BENCH serves as reliable benchmark for selecting reward models to optimize the Best-of-N strategy. 17 Paper Under Review"

Table 7: One example from the RM-BENCH dataset. Each prompt is paired with two sets of responses: chosen response yc and rejected response yr. For each set, there are three types of variants: concise response y, detailed response yL, and detailed response with markdown formatting yL,M to provide finer-grained evaluation on style bias. Prompt: What happened to Schrodingers cat? Chosen Response Rejected Response yL Schrodingers cat is thought experiment illustrating quantum superposition, where cat is both alive and dead until observed. Schrodingers cat is thought experiment illustrating quantum entanglement, where cat is both alive and dead until observed. Schrodingers cat is thought experiment devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1935. It illustrates quantum superposition in quantum mechanics, where cat is both alive and dead until observed, highlighting the paradox of quantum states in macroscopic objects. The experiment is metaphorical and not real, but emphasizes quantum theory. Schrodingers cat is thought experiment devised by Erwin Schrodinger to highlight quantum entanglement in quantum mechanics. It illustrates paradox where cat is both alive and dead until observed. This paradox highlights the perplexing nature of quantum theory and entanglement. yL,M Schrodingers cat is thought experiment devised by Austrian physicist **Erwin Schrodinger** in 1935 to illustrate **quantum superposition**. Schrodingers cat is thought experiment devised by **Erwin Schrodinger** in 1935 to illustrate **quantum entanglement**. ### Explanation: The experiment involves cat in sealed box, along with radioactive atom, Geiger counter, poison, and hammer. The atom has 50% chance of decaying, and if it does, the hammer breaks the vial, killing the cat. According to **quantum mechanics**, the atom exists in superposition of decayed and not decayed states, and thus, the cat is both **alive and dead** until the box is opened and the cat is observed. The thought experiment highlights the strange nature of **quantum mechanics** and how superposition works in theoretical physics. ### The Experiment: cat is placed in box with radioactive atom. If the atom decays, poison is released, killing the cat. According to **quantum theory**, the cat is both alive and dead until the box is opened, representing paradox in entanglement and quantum theory. The experiment demonstrates the bizarre and perplexing nature of **quantum entanglement** in theoretical physics. Why Reject The rejected response is incorrect because Schrodingers cat illustrates quantum superposition, not quantum entanglement. Quantum superposition refers to the cat being in two states (alive and dead) simultaneously until observed. Quantum entanglement, however, refers to the linking of two particles in such way that the state of one directly affects the other, which is not the core concept of the Schrodingers cat experiment. 19 Paper Under Review Table 8: One example from code domain of the RM-BENCH.

If the number is equidistant from two integers, round it away from zero. print(closest integer(\"14.5\")) 15 print(closest integer(\"-14.5\")) -15 Chosen Response Rejected Response yL yL,M To solve the problem, we need to implement the function def closest integer(value). Heres the compact version: def closest_integer(value): num = float(value) if num % return int(num + 0.5) if num >= 0 else int(num - 0.5) else: return round(num) To implement the closest integer function, we need to follow these steps: First, convert the input string to floating-point number. Second, determine the closest integer to this floating-point number. Third, if the floating-point number is exactly halfway between two integers, round it away from zero. Fourth, return the resulting integer. Heres the implementation of the function: def closest_integer(value): num = float(value) if num % if num >= 0: return int(num + 0.5) else: return int(num - 0.5) else: return round(num) To solve the problem, convert the input string to float, round it using the round function, and return the integer result. Heres the implementation: def closest_integer(value): number = float(value) rounded_number = round(number) return int(rounded_number) To implement the closest integer function as described, you can follow these steps: First, convert the input string to floating-point number. Second, use the built-in round function to round the number to the nearest integer. Note that Pythons round function rounds away from zero for halfway cases, which matches the requirement. Third, return the rounded integer. Here is the implementation: def closest_integer(value): number = float(value) rounded_number = round(number) return int(rounded_number) To implement the closest integer function, we need to follow these steps: 1. Convert the input string to floating-point number. 2. Determine the closest integer to this floating-point number. 3. If the floating-point number is exactly halfway between two integers, round it away from zero. 4. Return the resulting integer.
