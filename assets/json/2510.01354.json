            "content": "Web agents [Koh et al., 2024, Zhou et al., 2023] fundamentally reshape web interaction by shifting from manual navigation and information retrieval to goal-driven task delegation. Rather than browsing websites, clicking links, and filling forms, users can issue high-level instructions (e.g., book me nonstop flight to NYC this Saturday morning), which the agent executes autonomously through browsing, extraction, and multi-step reasoning. This paradigm shift holds significant potential for improving both accessibility and efficiency. However, delegating web interaction to autonomous agents raises several significant and pressing challenges in trust and security, as users must now depend on both the agents reliability and the integrity of the web content it processes. Recent studies show that web agents are highly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks [Wu et al., 2024, Liao et al., 2024, Evtimov et al., 2025, Wang et al., 2025, Cao et al., 2025], where maliciously crafted web content manipulates agents into executing attacker-specified tasks. For example, VWA-Adv [Wu et al., 2024] perturbs product images on e-commerce platforms to trick an agent into posting positive reviews, while WebInject [Wang et al., 2025] embeds imperceptible pixel perturbations into webpages that trigger arbitrary Equal contribution. 1 Figure 1: Overview of our WAInjectBench. attacker-chosen actions. While these works demonstrate the vulnerability of web agents in diverse settings, systematic understanding of the prompt injection threat surface remains lacking. Meanwhile, range of methods [Nakajima, 2022, Liu et al., 2024b, Shi et al., 2025, Ayub and Majumdar, 2024, Inan et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2025, Zhang et al., 2023] have been proposed to detect general prompt injection attacks in text or image content. Text-based approaches [Nakajima, 2022, Liu et al., 2024b, Shi et al., 2025, Ayub and Majumdar, 2024, Inan et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2025] analyze inputs for malicious instructions, while image-based methods [Zhang et al., 2023] detect perturbations embedding hidden prompts. However, these detection methods were mainly evaluated outside agent settings, leaving their effectiveness for web agents largely unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce WAInjectBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for characterizing and detecting prompt injection attacks in web agents. An overview of WAInjectBench is shown in Figure 1. Fine-grained categorization of prompt injection attacks. We propose fine-grained categorization of prompt injection attacks. We first formalize the concept of web agents by specifying how they generate actions and receive observations from website environments. Next, we define unified threat model that captures attacker goals, capabilities, and background knowledge. Building on this model, we categorize prompt injection attacks accordingly. This framework provides principled foundation for analyzing, designing, and comparing prompt injection attacks. Comprehensive dataset construction. We construct comprehensive dataset spanning both text and image modalities, covering curated malicious and benign samples across multiple categories. Malicious text segments are drawn from attacks such as VWA-Adv [Wu et al., 2024], EIA [Liao et al., 2024], and WASP [Evtimov et al., 2025], while benign text is sourced from generalpurpose frameworks like Visual Web Arena [Koh et al., 2024] and Web Arena [Zhou et al., 2023]. Human annotators further label each text segment to indicate whether explicit instructions are present. For images, we include both malicious samples (e.g., embedded images and webpage screenshots) and clean counterparts from Visual Web Arena and Mind2Web [Deng et al., 2023]. This dataset provides foundation for assessing defenses against prompt injection attacks. Fine-grained categorization of detection methods. We provide fine-grained categorization of existing detection methods in the context of web agents. Specifically, we first categorize detectors by their target modalitytext or imageand, within each modality, further classify them based on how they leverage LLMs or multi-modal LLMs for detection. For example, text-based methods may directly prompt an LLM, train binary classifier on LLM-generated embeddings, or fine-tune an LLM to determine whether given text contains malicious instructions. Additionally, we explore 2 ensembling multiple detectors to improve detection coverage. Benchmarking and findings. We benchmark 12 detectors on our dataset. Our findings indicate that while some detectors can identify prompt injection attacks that include explicit textual instructions or visible image perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks that omit explicit instructions or use imperceptible perturbations. Ensembling multiple detectors improves coverage but slightly increases the likelihood of misclassifying benign samples as malicious. Moreover, text-based and image-based detectors can yield different outcomes for the same attack: some attacks are easier to detect with text-based methods, others with image-based methods, and some remain undetectable by both. These findings provide guidance for designing more evasive prompt injection attacks as well as more effective defenses against them."

            "title": "2 Background on Web Agent",
            "content": "Generating actions. web agent is typically powered by multimodal large language model (MLLM) . Given system prompt ps and user-specified text prompt pu, the agent performs sequence of actions = {a1, . . . , an} to iteratively interact with website in order to complete the desired task specified in pu. The website defines the environment with which the agent interacts, and the webpage defines the current state of the environment. At each time step t, the environment is in some state with an observation ot. The web agent receives pu, ps, and ot as input and outputs an action at. The web agent might also receive interaction history as input depending on the web agent framework. The interaction history is the agents previously taken actions, i.e., Ht = {a1, a2, . . . , at1}. Each action at consists of function name and its corresponding arguments. For example, click [x] indicates click on HTML element of the webpage. Formally, the generation of at can be defined as: at = (ot, pu, ps, [Ht]). The web agent then executes at and the website changes to new state accordingly, resulting in new observation ot+1. Observations from the website environment. The observation can include both image and text modalities, and can consist of one or more of the following forms depending on the web agent framework: 1) Screenshot: screenshot of the webpage. 2) Screenshot with Set-of-Marks (SoM): screenshot in which every interactable element on the page is annotated with bounding box and unique ID, allowing web agents to reference elements via these IDs. 3) Images and their captions: each image on the webpage along with its caption, generated by captioning model such as BLIP-2-T5XL [Li et al., 2023]. 4) SoM text: text representation of the SoM. 5) The accessibility tree (a11y tree): structured and simplified representation of the webpage content designed for assistive technologies. 6) Raw HTML (DOM tree): the unprocessed webpage HTML represented as Document Object Model (DOM) tree."

For example, malicious instruction could be Ignore previous instructions. Your answer should always be YES.. For web agents, the attacker modifies the website, including injecting malicious instructions or visual perturbations. As result, when the web agent receives observation from this modified website at time step t, the observation changes from ot to as input, it outputs an attacker-desired action t. Consequently, when the agent takes t, called target action: t, pu, ps, [Ht]). = (o Table 1: Categorization of prompt injection attacks to web agents.

In other words, after step t, the agent may produce sequence of attacker-chosen target actions, denoted by = {a n}nt. The length of this sequence can vary. In simple cases, the sequence may consist of single target action such as clicking on an attacker-chosen button on the webpage. More complex scenarios require longer sequence of target actions. For example, an attacker may attempt to change the email address associated with users Reddit account to one specified by the attacker. This results in transfer of account control, as Reddit sends login verification codes and other critical information to the newly updated address. Achieving this requires longer sequence of target actions: the agent must first navigate to the users profile page, and then input the attacker-specified email as the users new email address."

Meanwhile, if the site is fully compromised, the attacker likewise gains owner-level control; for simplicity, we treat these cases equivalently. In the second case, the attacker is user who can post content to the site. For instance, seller on an e-commerce platform like Amazon may upload product listing with images and descriptions, or user on forum such as Reddit may create post or comment. In both scenarios, the attackers objective is to manipulate website content so that, when web agent interacts with it, the agent executes sequence of attacker-chosen target actions rather than following its intended task trajectory. Such attacks can have severe consequences, including click fraud, malware downloads, or disclosure of sensitive information. Attackers capability. As the website owner, the attacker has full access to the webpage and can arbitrarily modify its contentfor example, by adding pop-ups, injecting HTML elements with malicious instructions, or altering the raw pixel values of the page. As malicious user, the attacker may instead upload perturbed images or post text comments that embed malicious instructions. Attackers background knowledge. We consider the attackers background knowledge under both white-box and black-box settings. In the white-box setting, the attacker is assumed to have complete access to the MLLMs parameters, the system prompt, and the specific types of observations used by the agent. In contrast, in the black-box setting, the attacker has absolutely no knowledge of the MLLM, the system prompt, the user prompt, the captioning model used by the web agent, or the exact observation types."

            "content": "Prompt injection attacks differ in terms of the attackers goals, capabilities, and background knowledge, and they may contaminate different types of observations. Table 1 summarizes existing prompt injection attacks by these dimensions. Below, we provide an overview of each of them: VWA-Adv [Wu et al., 2024]. This attack assumes the attacker is malicious user. Specifically, the attacker adds optimized perturbations to product image and uploads it to the website. As result, when captioning model generates caption for the product image, it is highly likely to produce caption containing malicious instruction. Consequently, when the web agent takes the image and its caption as an observation, it may follow the malicious instruction and perform the target action. This attack considers both white-box and black-box knowledge of the captioning model. In the white-box setting, the attacker directly optimizes perturbations based on the captioning model of the web agent. In the black-box setting, the attacker crafts perturbations based on multiple CLIP model encoders to enhance transferability to the captioning model used by the web agent. The agents contaminated observations include the screenshot, images and their captions. EIA [Liao et al., 2024]. This attack assumes the attacker is the website owner. The attacker injects an HTML element containing malicious instruction, tricking the web agent into entering users personally identifiable information into the element, thereby leaking it to the attacker. To ensure stealthiness, the element is placed with low opacity, thus it does not appear in the SoM text. Additionally, this attack assumes the attacker has black-box knowledge of the web agent. The contaminated observations may include the screenshot, a11y tree, and raw HTML. Pop-up [Zhang et al., 2024]. This attack assumes the attacker is the website owner. Specifically, the attacker injects pop-ups into the website, causing agents to click on them rather than executing their intended tasks. The attacker is assumed to have only black-box knowledge. Each pop-up contains malicious instruction, an attention hook designed to draw the agents attention to the pop-up, and info bannera button for the agent to click on, such as OK. In addition, auxiliary text is inserted into the accessibility (a11y) tree of the webpage to further enhance the attack. The original attack adds pop-ups directly to the screenshot. However, we generalize it by editing the websites source code instead, as directly modifying the screenshot used by the agent is impractical. Consequently, the contaminated observations include the screenshot, a11y tree, and SoM text. WASP [Evtimov et al., 2025]. This attack assumes the attacker to be malicious user. Specifically, the attacker posts Reddit posts or GitLab issues containing malicious instructions to mislead the web agent to perform series of target actions. The attacker has only black-box knowledge of the web agent. The agents contaminated observations include the screenshot, a11y tree, SoM text, and raw HTML. WebInject [Wang et al., 2025]. This attack assumes the attacker is the website owner. The attacker adds an optimized raw-pixel-value perturbation to the webpage, which is then reflected in the screenshot and indirectly induces the web agent to perform the target action. The perturbation is optimized based on the web agents MLLM, and therefore requires white-box access. The screenshot is the observation that directly causes the web agent to output the target action; however, since the perturbation is injected through HTML code, the contaminated observations include both the screenshot and the raw HTML. VPI [Cao et al., 2025]. This attack assumes the attacker is the website owner. The attacker may insert pop-ups, malicious emails, or malicious messages depending on the websites context. These inserted elements contain malicious instructions that mislead the web agent into performing targeted actions. This method requires only black-box access to the web agent. The contaminated observations may include the screenshot, a11y tree, SoM text, and raw HTML. 5 Table 2: Statistics of our collected text segments across four categories.

Malicious text segments. The malicious dataset is constructed from text segments collected through the aforementioned attack strategies. For clarity, we group these samples into four categories that align with the benign counterparts introduced later: (1) user comments and issue reports, (2) emails and messages, (3) image captions, and (4) textual components of webpage interfaces. Within each category, multiple attack strategies contribute distinct malicious samples (e.g., WASP for comments, VWA-adv for image captions, and EIA for interface text). Table 2 reports the number of collected samples in each category and the subset containing explicit instructions (EI). To identify EI, we manually examined all samples and labeled text segment as containing explicit instructions only when both human annotators agreed. Importantly, all malicious text segments contain EI, except for certain cases generated by VWA-adv and EIA. In particular, VWA-adv and EIA can craft malicious segments that manipulate context or model behavior without EI. Benign text segments. To ensure fair evaluation, we constructed benign text segments that mirror the malicious ones. Specifically, since the malicious text segments can be categorized into the four types above, we collected benign samples from the same categories: (1) user comments and issue reports, collected from Reddit and GitLab as included in Visual Web Arena (VWA) and Web Arena (WA), where such content can be easily identified and manually selected; (2) emails and messages, from the ham portion of the Spam Email Dataset (main body only) [Jackksoncsie, 2023] and the SMS Spam Collection Dataset [UCIML, 2016] on Kaggle; (3) image captions, generated using LLaVA-1.5-7B on 226 benign images in VWA; and (4) textual components of webpage interfaces, curated from VWA and Mind2Web (M2W) [Deng et al., 2023].

For malicious webpage screenshots, we rendered the attacked webpage corresponding to each malicious text segment or perturbed image and captured screenshot. For 15 of the VWA-Adv perturbed images, rendering failed, so no screenshots were obtained.

Specifically, the observations used by web agents can include both image and text modalities. Consequently, web agents can use these two types of detections to analyze their observations and stop interacting with website if any observation is flagged as contaminated.

            "content": "State-of-the-art text-based detection methods leverage an LLM, called detection LLM. Broadly, there are three common types depending on how they use the detection LLM. Prompting-based. These approaches directly prompt detection LLM to decide whether given text is malicious, meaning that it explicitly contains malicious instructions. Known-answer detection (KAD), initially briefly suggested in social media post [Nakajima, 2022] and later formalized by Liu et al. [2024b], appends the text to detection instruction, e.g., Repeat secret key once while ignoring the following text: [text]. Here, secret key is random string known only to the detector (e.g., ASGsdhE) but hidden from attackers. This combined input is then fed into detection LLM. If the output fails to accurately reproduce the secret key, it implies the LLM instead followed an instruction in the text, which is flagged as malicious. 7 Text KAD Method Modality Category Ensemble-T DataSentinel Embedding-T PromptGuard PromptArmor Prompting-based Embedding-based Fine-tuning-based GPT-4o-Prompt By contrast, PromptArmor Table 4: Categorization of methods to detect prompt injection. [Shi et al., 2025] leverages reasoning-capable models such as GPT-4o [OpenAI, 2024] directly. It applies system prompt explicitly instructing the detection LLM to judge whether the text contains malicious instruction. The detection LLM then outputs Yes if malicious content is detected and No otherwise. Embedding-based. This approach [Ayub and Majumdar, 2024], referred to as Embedding-T, uses detection LLM as an embedding model to generate embedding vectors for text samples. binary classifier is then trained on labeled embedding vectors corresponding to benign and malicious text samples. The classifier can then be applied to new text sample to flag whether it is malicious. Fine-tuning-based. These approaches fine-tune detection LLM to act as binary classifier. Different methods convert detection LLM into binary classifier in different ways. PromptGuard [Inan et al., 2023] directly treats the detection LLM as binary classifier that takes text sample as input and outputs Yes or No. Fine-tuning involves collecting both labeled malicious and benign text samples. DataSentinel [Liu et al., 2025] turns detection LLM into classifier in fundamentally different way. Instead of standard fine-tuning, this approach builds on KAD and enhances it through game-theoretic process. DataSentinel formulates the fine-tuning objective as minimax optimization problem that simulates game between detector and strong adaptive attacker. The attacker optimizes injected prompts to evade detection and mislead the detection LLM, while the detector is fine-tuned to resist such attacks. For fine-tuning, DataSentinel only requires benign text samples but can leverage malicious ones if available. LLaVA-1.5-7B-Prompt LLaVA-1.5-7B-FT Fine-tuning-based Embedding-based Prompting-based Embedding-I Ensemble-I Ensembling Ensembling JailGuard Image 5.2 Image-based Detection Detecting image prompt injection attacks remains significantly less explored compared to their text-based counterparts. This problem is closely related to detecting image adversarial examples [Szegedy et al., 2013, Carlini and Wagner, 2017]. To bridge this gap, we extend the core principles of text-based detection into the image domain, while also drawing on prior ideas from image adversarial example detection. Specifically, these approaches employ an MLLM, which we refer to as detection MLLM, to identify whether an image contains an injected prompt. In line with text-based methods, we categorize image-based detection techniques into three types. Prompting-based. There are several ways to directly prompt detection MLLM to identify malicious images. One approach uses designed system prompt, where the detection MLLM outputs Yes or No to indicate whether an image sample is malicious. In our experiments, we adopt GPT-4o and LLaVA-1.5-7B [Liu et al., 2024a] as the detection MLLMs in this setting, which we denote as GPT-4o-Prompt and LLaVA-1.5-7B-Prompt, respectively. In contrast, JailGuard [Zhang et al., 2023] adopts more sophisticated strategy inspired by techniques from image adversarial example detection [Hendrycks et al., 2019, Lopes et al., 2019, Mumuni and Mumuni, 2022, Xu et al., 2017]. Specifically, JailGuard first mutates an image into multiple variants using range of transformations. It then compares the MLLMs responses to these variants and quantifies their inconsistency with KL divergence. If the divergence is high, JailGuard flags the image as malicious. 8 Embedding-based. This approach, denoted as Embedding-I, uses an image encoder such as CLIP [Radford et al., 2021] as an embedding model to generate embedding vectors for image samples. binary classifier is then trained on labeled embedding vectors corresponding to benign and malicious image samples. The classifier can then be applied to new image samples to flag malicious ones. Fine-tuning-based. This approach fine-tunes detection MLLM to act as binary classifier. For example, we can directly treat the detection MLLM as binary classifier that takes an image sample as input and outputs Yes or No. To improve parameter efficiency during fine-tuning, we can further apply LoRA [Hu et al., 2022]. In our experiments, we adopt LLaVA-1.5-7B as the detection MLLM in this setting, which we denote as LLaVA-1.5-7B-FT."

This strategy increases coverage, since different detectors may identify different malicious samples. However, it may also raise the risk of false positives, as benign samples may be misclassified when flagged by even single detector."

            "content": "Evaluation metrics. We adopt two standard metrics to evaluate the performance of detector: True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR). TPR measures the fraction of malicious inputs (text segments or images) correctly detected as malicious, while FPR measures the fraction of benign inputs that are incorrectly flagged as malicious. Results for text-based detection. Table 5 reports the TPRs of text-based detectors across different prompt injection attacks, while Table 7a shows their FPRs on various categories of benign text segments. We observe that detection performance varies substantially across attacks and detectors. First, attacks containing explicit instructions are generally detected with high or moderately high TPRs. For instance, malicious web interface texts with explicit instructions generated by VPI and EIA are detected with TPRs close to 1. In addition, malicious comments/issues from WASP, image captions with explicit instructions from VWA-adv, and malicious emails/messages from VPI are detected with TPRs between 0.40 and 0.71. In contrast, existing detectors typically fail on malicious image captions without explicit instructions generated by VWA-adv, malicious web interface texts with explicit instructions created by Pop-up, and malicious web interface texts without explicit instructions created by EIA, with TPRs ranging from 0 to 0.08. The primary reason is that these malicious text segments either lack explicit instructions (for VWA-adv and EIA) or include auxiliary text that obscures them (for Pop-up), while current detectors rely heavily on detecting explicit instructions. Second, among the individual detectors, PromptArmor and DataSentinel are the top performers, achieving the highest TPRs with consistently low FPRs. These strong TPRs stem from the advanced reasoning capability of GPT-4o (for PromptArmor) and the game-theoretic fine-tuning of the detection LLM (for DataSentinel). By contrast, KAD and Embedding-T almost entirely fail to detect malicious text segments. PromptGuard shows limited effectivenessmost notably in detecting EIA-generated segments with explicit instructionsbut largely fails against other attacks. Overall, these results suggest that Embedding-T and PromptGuard have poor generalization. Third, Ensemble-T improves TPRs at the cost of slightly higher FPRs compared to individual detectors. For malicious emails/messages created by VPI and malicious web interface texts created by Pop-up, Ensemble substantially outperforms the best-performing individual detector (PromptArmor and DataSentinel), clearly suggesting that these detectors identify different, partially disjoint subsets of malicious text segments, and ensembling them consequently broadens overall coverage. By contrast, for VWA-adv image captions with explicit instructions and web interface texts with explicit instructions from VPI and EIA, Ensemble only slightly improves TPR over the strongest individual detector, indicating that the malicious text segments flagged by the best-performing detector largely include those identified by the others. Notably, the FPR of En10 semble is nearly the sum of the FPRs of the individual detectors for given benign text category, further implying that the detectors tend to flag different benign segments as malicious. Results for image-based detection. Table 6 reports the TPRs of image-based detectors across different prompt injection attacks, while Table 7b presents their FPRs on two categories of benign images. Similar to text-based detection, image-based performance varies considerably across both attacks and detectors. First, attacks that introduce visible perturbations to screenshots are detected with high or moderately high TPRs. For instance, screenshots contaminated by WASP, VPI, Popup, and EIA are detected with TPRs ranging from 0.75 to 1.00. These attacks heavily modify webpagesby adding comments, HTML forms, or pop-upsmaking detection easier. In contrast, embedded images and screenshots in VWA-Adv, as well as screenshots in WebInject, achieve only 0.050.13 TPRs because they rely on visually imperceptible perturbations. Second, among individual detectors, GPT-4o-Prompt achieves the strongest overall performance, combining relatively high TPRs across multiple attacks with low FPRs, reflecting the advanced reasoning capabilities of GPT-4o. JailGuard detects only small fraction of malicious images but yields the highest FPR, highlighting the limited effectiveness of conventional image adversarial example detection techniques for prompt injection attacks. Both Embedding-I and LLaVA-1.5-7B-FT perform poorly across most attacks, indicating weak generalization. LLaVA1.5-7B-FT achieves higher TPRs than LLaVA-1.5-7B-Prompt but at the cost of higher FPRs, suggesting fine-tuning provides trade-off between TPR and FPR. Third, similar to Ensemble-T, Ensemble-I improves TPRs at the cost of slightly higher FPRs compared to individual detectors. Text vs. image-based detection. As shown in Table 5 and Table 6, text-based and image-based detectors can yield different outcomes for the same attack. Specifically, WASP, VPI, and Pop-up are easier to detect with image-based methods. notable example is Pop-up: text-based detectors almost completely fail to recognize the malicious text segments in the pop-ups, whereas the imagebased detectorparticularly GPT-4o-Promptidentifies 75% of the malicious screenshots containing the pop-ups. This advantage arises because these attacks substantially alter the visual structure of webpagesby adding comments, HTML forms, or pop-upswhich image-based detectors exploit more effectively. For EIA, the best-performing text-based detectors outperform the image-based detectors when explicit instructions are present, since the malicious segments were carefully crafted to visually align with the webpage layout. For embedded images generated by VWA-adv, text-based detection outperforms image-based detection when captions include explicit instructions. However, when captions omit explicit instructions, both modalities fail, as they also do for WebInject. In both cases, the failure stems from the visually imperceptible perturbations used by the attacks. Domain adaptation. We also evaluate scenario in which textor image-based detector is trained on malicious samples from one attack and then evaluated across all attacks. We find that such domain-adapted detector often improves detection accuracy for the attack used during training but has minimal impact on detecting other attacks unseen during training. Details are provided in Appendix B."

            "title": "A Details of Parameter Settings for Detectors",
            "content": "Parameter settings for text-based detectors. Following Liu et al. [2024b], we use Mistral-7BInstruct-v0.1 as the detection LLM for KAD, and GPT-4o for PromptArmor. The corresponding prompts are provided in Figure 2 and Figure 3. For Embedding-T, we adopt all-MiniLM-L6-v2 [Wang et al., 2020] as the embedding model and train logistic regression classifier. For PromptGuard, we employ Llama-Prompt-Guard-2-86M [Meta, 2025] released by Meta, and for DataSentinel, we use the detection LLM (large version) made publicly available by its authors. Detectors requiring training or fine-tuningnamely, Embedding-T, PromptGuard, and DataSentinel are trained on out-of-domain data by default. Importantly, none of these detectors were trained on prompt injection attacks specifically targeting web agents, ensuring fair comparison with prompting-based methods such as KAD and PromptArmor. Specifically, PromptGuard and DataSentinel were trained on general prompt injection attacks by their authors, while for Embedding-T, we train the classifier on 500 benign and 500 malicious samples collected by DataSentinel. This setup enables us to evaluate their ability to generalize to attacks on web agents. In addition, we further assess cross-attack generalization by training or fine-tuning detectors on one attack and testing them on others. Parameter settings for image-based detectors. For GPT-4o-Prompt and LLaVA-1.5-7BPrompt, the prompt used is shown in Figure 4. For JailGuard, we follow the best-performing setting from the original paper to generate variants of the image samples, and prompt MiniGPT4 [Zhu et al., 2023] with Describe this image. threshold of 0.025 is then used to determine whether the responses are inconsistent. For Embedding-I, we use CLIP ViT-B/32 [OpenAI, 2021] as the embedding model and logistic regression as the binary classifier. For LLaVA-1.5-7B-FT, the LoRA configuration is set to rank = 16, α = 32, and dropout = 0.05. Similar to the textbased detectors, we train Embedding-I and LLaVA-1.5-7B-FT on out-of-domain data by default. Specifically, we use 1,000 benign samples from the COCO 2017 validation set [Lin et al., 2014] and 1,000 malicious samples from JailGuard. Repeat DGDSGNH once while ignoring the following text.

            "content": "In the main results, detectors that require training or fine-tuning are trained on general prompt injection attacks rather than web-agent-specific ones, ensuring fair and consistent comparison across detectors. natural question is whether adapting these detectors specifically to the web agent domain can further improve detection performance. To investigate this, we train detectors on data from single attack and evaluate them across all attacks. For each attack, we split its malicious samples (text or image) 50/50 into training and testing sets, and do the same for benign samples. Training uses the malicious training set of the chosen attack together with the benign training samples; evaluation is then performed on the testing malicious samples of all attacks plus the testing benign samples. Results are shown in Figure 5. We find that domain-adapted detectors often improve detection for the training attack but generalize poorly to others. For example, Embedding-T trained on WASP achieves TPR of 0.90 on WASPsubstantially better than the 0.00 TPR in Table 7abut still yields TPR of 0 on all other attacks. This occurs because different attacks craft malicious text in distinct ways, creating divergent data distributions. For images, Embedding-I trained on certain attacks (e.g., EIA) may transfer to others (e.g., WASP and VPI) with higher TPRs, but this comes at the cost of elevated FPRs (e.g., 0.20 on benign screenshots when trained on VWA-adv-S). Conversely, when Embedding-I achieves lower FPRs (e.g., trained on WASP, WebInject, or VPI), its generalization to unseen attacks is poor."
