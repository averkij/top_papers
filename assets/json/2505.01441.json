            "title": "1\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advances in complex reasoning tasks [Wei\net al., 2023, Kojima et al., 2023], fueled by innovations in model architecture, scale, and training.\nAmong these, reinforcement learning (RL) [Sutton et al., 1998] stands out as a particularly effective\nmethod for amplifying LLMs’ reasoning abilities.

            "content": "However, despite these advances, RL-enhanced LLMs still rely primarily on internal knowledge and language modeling [Wang et al., 2024]. This reliance becomes major limitation for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, where the models static knowledge base may be outdated or incomplete, often resulting in inaccuracies or hallucinations [Hu et al., 2024]. Moreover, such models struggle with complex, domain-specific, or open-ended problems that require precise computation, structured manipulation, or specialized tool use. These challenges underscore the inadequacy of purely text-based reasoning and the need for LLMs to access and integrate external information sources during the reasoning process. Agentic reasoning addresses these limitations by enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with both external resources and environments throughout the reasoning process [Xiong et al., 2025, Patil, Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: The ARTIST architecture. Agentic reasoning is achieved by interleaving text-based thinking, tool queries, and tool outputs, enabling dynamic coordination of reasoning, tool use, and environment interaction within unified framework. 2025]. External resources include web search, code execution, API calls, and structured memory, while environments encompass interactive settings such as web browsers (e.g., WebArena [Zhou et al., 2024]) or operating systems (e.g., WindowsAgentArena [Bonatti et al., 2024]). Unlike conventional approaches relying solely on internal inference, agentic reasoning empowers models to orchestrate tool use and adaptively coordinate research, computation, and logical deduction actively engaging with external resources and environments to solve complex, real-world problems [Wu et al., 2025, Rasal and Hauer, 2024]. Many real-world tasks such as math reasoning [Mouselinos et al., 2024], multi-step mathematical derivations, programmatic data analysis [Zhao et al., 2024], or up-to-date fact retrieval demand capabilities that extend beyond the scope of language modeling alone. For example, function-calling frameworks like BFCLv3 [Yan et al., 2024] allow LLMs to invoke specialized functions for file operations, data parsing, or API-based retrieval, while agentic environments such as WebArena empower models to autonomously plan and execute sequences of web interactions to accomplish open-ended objectives. In math problem solving, external libraries like SymPy [Meurer et al., 2017] or NumPy [Harris et al., 2020] empower LLMs to perform symbolic algebra and computation with far greater accuracy and efficiency than text-based reasoning alone. Despite these advances, current tool-integration strategies for LLMs face major scalability and robustness challenges [Sun et al., 2024]. Most approaches rely on hand-crafted prompts or fixed heuristics, which are labor-intensive and do not generalize to complex or unseen scenarios [Luo et al., 2025]. While prompting [Gao et al., 2023] and supervised fine-tuning [Gou et al., 2024, Paranjape et al., 2023] can teach tool use, these methods are limited by curated data and struggle to adapt to new tasks or recover from tool failures. As result, models often misuse tools or revert to brittle behaviors, highlighting the need for scalable, data-efficient, and adaptive tool-use frameworks. To overcome the limitations of text-only reasoning, we introduce new paradigm for LLMs: agentic reasoning through tool integration. Our framework, ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-Improving Transformers), empowers LLMs to learn optimal strategies for leveraging external tools and interacting with complex environments via reinforcement learning (see Figure 1). Here, self-improving transformers refers to models that iteratively generate and learn from their own solutions, progressively tackling harder problems while maintaining the standard transformer architecture. ARTIST interleaves tool queries and tool outputs directly within the reasoning chain, treating tool usage as first-class operation. In this framework, tool usage is not limited to isolated API calls or computations, but can involve active interaction within external environmentssuch as navigating web browser or operating system interfacethrough sequences of tool invocations. Specifically, the reasoning process alternates between segments of text-based thinking (<think>...</think>), tool queries (e.g., <tool_name>...</tool_name>), and tool outputs (<output>...</output>), allowing the model to seamlessly coordinate reasoning, tool usage and environment interaction. Motivating Example. Consider Math Olympiad problem requiring closed-form expression or complex integral. Traditional RL-trained LLMs [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025] rely on text-based reasoning, often compounding errors in symbolic manipulation. In contrast, ARTIST enables the model to generate Python code, call Python interpreter, and use libraries like SymPy [Meurer et al., 2017] for precise computationseamlessly integrating results into the reasoning chain. This dynamic interplay of language and tool use boosts accuracy and allows iterative self-correction, overcoming the limitations of purely text-based approaches. This agentic structure enables the model to autonomously decide not only which tools to use, but also when and how to invoke them during multi-turn reasoningcontinually adapting its strategy based on context and feedback from both the environment and tool outputs. Tool results inform subsequent 2 Figure 2: Overview of the ARTIST methodology. The framework illustrates how reasoning rollouts alternate between internal thinking, tool use, and environment interaction, with outcome-based rewards guiding learning. This enables the model to iteratively refine its reasoning and tool-use strategies through reinforcement learning. reasoning, creating tightly coupled loop between text-based inference and tool-augmented actions. Notably, ARTIST requires no supervision for intermediate steps or tool calls; instead, we employ reinforcement learningspecifically, the GRPO [Shao et al., 2024] algorithmto guide the model using only outcome-based rewards. This enables LLMs to develop adaptive, robust, and generalizable tool-use behaviors, overcoming the brittleness and scalability issues of prior methods. To rigorously assess the effectiveness and generality of ARTIST, we conduct extensive experiments in two core domains: complex mathematical problem solving and multi-turn function calling. Our evaluation covers broad range of challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 [Hendrycks et al., 2021], AIME [hug, a], AMC [hug, b], and Olympiad Bench [He et al., 2024] for math reasoning, as well as τ -bench [Yao et al., 2024] and multiple BFCL v3 [Yan et al., 2024] subcategories for multi-turn tool use. We benchmark ARTIST on both 7B and 14B Qwen2.5-Instruct models [Qwen et al., 2025], comparing against comprehensive suite of baselinesspanning frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o [OpenAI, 2024], DeepSeek-R1 [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025]), open-source tool-augmented models (e.g., ToRA [Gou et al., 2024], NuminaMath-TIR [Beeching et al., 2024]), prompt-based tool integration, and base models with or without external tools. ARTIST consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving substantial gains on the most complex tasks. In mathematical reasoning, it delivers up to 22% absolute improvement over base models and surpasses GPT-4o and other leading models on AMC, AIME, and Olympiad. For multi-turn function calling, ARTIST more than doubles the accuracy of base and prompt-based models on τ -bench and achieves strong gains on the hardest BFCL v3 subsets. Detailed ablations and metric analyses show that agentic RL training in ARTIST leads to deeper reasoning, more effective tool use, and higher-quality solutions. Across both domains, we observe that ARTIST exhibits emergent agentic behaviorsincluding adaptive tool selection, iterative self-correction, and context-aware multi-step reasoningall arising naturally from its unified agentic RL framework. These findings provide compelling evidence that agentic reasoning, when tightly integrated with reinforcement learning and dynamic tool use, marks paradigm shift in LLM capabilities. As result, ARTIST not only surpasses prior approaches but also sets new standard for robust, interpretable, and generalizable problem-solving in real-world scenarios. Our key contributions are: unified agentic RL framework: We introduce ARTIST, the first framework to tightly couple agentic reasoning, dynamic tool integration, and reinforcement learning for LLMs, enabling adaptive, multi-turn problem solving across diverse domains. Generalizable tool use and environment interaction: ARTIST supports seamless integration with arbitrary external tools and environments, allowing LLMs to learn not just which tools to use, but when and how to invoke them within complex reasoning chains. Extensive, rigorous evaluation: We provide the most comprehensive evaluation to date, covering both mathematical and multi-turn function calling tasks, wide range of benchmarks, model scales, and baseline categories, along with detailed ablations and metric analyses."

            "content": "We present ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-Improving Transformers), general and extensible framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to reason with and act upon external tools and environments via reinforcement learning. Unlike prior methods [Schick et al., 2023, Gao et al., 2023] that focus on isolated tool use or narrow domains, ARTIST supports seamless integration with wide range of toolsincluding code interpreters, web search engines, and domainspecific APIsas well as interactive environments such as web browsers and operating systems. This section details the methodology, RL training procedure, prompt templates for structuring reasoning and tool interaction, and our approach to reward modeling. 2.1 Methodology ARTIST treats tool usage and environment interaction as core components of the models reasoning trajectory. The LLM dynamically decides which tools or environments to engage, when to invoke them, and how to incorporate their outputs into multi-step solutions, making it applicable to broad spectrum of real-world tasks. Figure 2 illustrates the methodology: for each input, the policy model generates multiple reasoning rollouts, alternating between text-based reasoning (<think>...</think>) and tool interactions. At each step, the model determines which tool to call, when to invoke it, and how to formulate the query based on the current context. The tool interacts with the external environment (e.g., executing code, searching the web, or calling an API) and returns an output, which is incorporated back into the reasoning chain. This iterative process allows the model to explore diverse reasoning and tool-use trajectories. By making tool usage and environment interaction first-class operations, ARTIST enables LLMs to develop flexible, adaptive, and context-aware strategies for complex, multi-step tasks. This agentic approach supports robust self-correction and iterative refinement through continuous interaction with external resources. 2.2 Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Training agentic LLMs with tool and environment integration requires reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that is sample-efficient, stable, and effective with outcome-based rewards. Recent work, such as DeepSeek-R1 [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025], has shown that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [Shao et al., 2024] achieves strong performance in language model RL by leveraging groupwise outcome rewards and removing the need for value function approximation. This reduces training cost and simplifies optimization, making GRPO well-suited for our framework. Group Relative Policy Optimization. GRPO extends Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [Schulman et al., 2017] by eliminating the critic and instead estimating the baseline from group of sampled responses. For each question q, group of responses {y1, y2, . . . , yG} is sampled from the old policy πold, and the policy model πθ is optimized by maximizing the following objective: JGRPO(θ) = xD,{yi}G i=1 πold(x;R) (cid:34) 1 G (cid:88) i=1 1 (cid:80)yi t=1 I(yi,t) yi (cid:88) t=1 (yi,t=1) min (cid:32) πθ (yi,t x, yi,<t; R) πold(yi,t x, yi,<t; R) ˆAi,t, (1) clip (cid:32) πθ (yi,t x, yi,<t; R) πold(yi,t x, yi,<t; R) (cid:33) (cid:33) (cid:35) , 1 ϵ, 1 + ϵ ˆAi,t βDKL[πθ πref] where ϵ and β are hyperparameters, and ˆAi,t represents the advantage, computed based on the relative rewards of outputs within each group. Adapting GRPO for Agentic Reasoning with Tool Integration. In ARTIST, rollouts alternate between model-generated reasoning steps and tool outputs, capturing agentic interactions with external tools and environments. Applying token-level loss uniformly can cause the model to imitate deterministic tool outputs, rather than learning effective tool invocation strategies. To prevent this, we employ loss masking strategy: tokens from tool outputs are masked during loss computation, ensuring gradients are only propagated through model-generated tokens. This focuses optimization on 4 the agents reasoning and decision-making, while avoiding spurious updates from deterministic tool responses. The complete training procedure for ARTIST with GRPO is summarized in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Training ARTIST with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for each task in batch do Initialize reasoning chain while not end of episode do Sample rollouts {y1, . . . , yG} from πold: for each rollout yi do Generate next segment: <think> or <tool_name> if tool is invoked then Require: Policy model πθ, old policy πold, task dataset D, group size G, masking function 1: for each training iteration do 2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: 20: end for end for Compute groupwise advantages ˆAi,t for all yi Compute importance weights ri,t Apply loss masking to exclude tool output tokens Compute GRPO loss LGRPO and update πθ end if end while Compute outcome reward R(yi) Interact with environment, obtain <output> Append output to reasoning chain end for 2.3 Rollouts in ARTIST In ARTIST, rollouts are structured to alternate between internal reasoning and interaction with external tools or environments. Unlike standard RL rollouts that consist solely of model-generated tokens, ARTIST employs an iterative framework where the LLM interleaves text generation with tool and environment queries. Prompt Template. ARTIST uses structured prompt template that organizes outputs into four segments: (1) internal reasoning (<think>...</think>), (2) tool or environment queries (<tool_name>...</tool_name>), (3) tool outputs (<output>...</output>), and (4) the final answer (<answer>...</answer>). Upon issuing tool query, the model invokes the corresponding tool or environment, appends the output, and continues the reasoning cycle until the answer is produced. The complete prompt template is provided in Appendix A. Rollout Process. Each rollout consists of these structured segments, with the policy model deciding at each step whether to reason internally or interact with an external resource. Tool invocations may include code execution, API calls, web search, file operations, or actions in interactive environments like web browsers or operating systems. Outputs from these interactions are incorporated back into the reasoning chain, enabling iterative refinement and adaptive strategy adjustment based on feedback. See Appendix for illustrative rollout examples in various scenarios. 2.4 Reward Design well-designed reward function is essential for effective RL training, as it provides the optimization signal that steers the policy toward desirable behaviors. In GRPO, outcome-based rewards have proven both efficient and effective, supporting robust policy improvement without requiring dense intermediate supervision. However, ARTIST introduces new challenges for reward design: beyond producing correct final answers, the model must also structure its reasoning, tool use, and environment interactions coherently and reliably. To address this, we use composite reward mechanism that provides fine-grained feedback for each rollout. The reward function in ARTIST consists of three key components: Answer Reward: This component assigns positive reward when the model generates the correct final answer, as identified within the <answer>...</answer> tags. The answer reward directly 5 incentivizes the model to solve the task correctly, ensuring that the ultimate objective of the reasoning process is met. Format Reward: To promote structured and interpretable reasoning, we introduce format reward that encourages adherence to the prescribed prompt template. This reward checks two main criteria: (1) the correct order of executionreasoning (<think>), tool call (<tool_name>), and tool output (<output>) is maintained throughout the rollout; and (2) the final answer is properly enclosed within <answer> tags. The format reward helps the model learn to organize its outputs in way that is both consistent and easy to parse, which is essential for reliable tool invocation and downstream evaluation. Tool Execution Reward: During each tool interaction, the models queries may or may not be well-formed or executable. To encourage robust and effective tool use, we introduce tool execution reward, defined as the fraction of successful tool calls: Tool Execution Reward ="

            "title": "3 Case Study",
            "content": "We present two case studies to illustrate the versatility of ARTIST. The first focuses on complex mathematical reasoning, where ARTIST leverages external tools like Python interpreter for multistep computation. The second examines multi-turn function calling, demonstrating how ARTIST orchestrates sequential tool use and adapts its reasoning strategy in dynamic, real-world environments. 3.1 Complex Mathematical Reasoning with Agentic Tool Use While LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on mathematical reasoning tasks using natural language, they often struggle with complex problems that require precise, multi-step calculationssuch as multiplying large numbers or evaluating definite integrals. Purely text-based reasoning in these cases can be inefficient and error-prone. To address this, ARTIST augments LLMs with access to an external Python interpreter, enabling the model to offload complex computations and verify intermediate results programmatically. Prompt Template During rollouts, the model is prompted to structure its output using special tokens. Internal reasoning is enclosed within <think>...</think> tags, while any code intended for execution is placed within <python>...</python> tags. The code is executed by an external Python interpreter, and the resulting output is returned to the model inside <output>...</output> tags. The final answer is provided within <answer>...</answer> tags. The complete prompt used for guiding the model is listed in Appendix A. Reward Design To guide the RL algorithm, we employ three reward components tailored to the mathematical reasoning setting: Answer Reward: The model receives reward of 2 if the final answer exactly matches the ground truth, and 0 otherwise: Ranswer = (cid:26)2, if ypred = yground 0, otherwise Format Reward: To encourage structured outputs, we provide both relaxed and strict format rewards: Relaxed: For each of the four required tag pairs (<think>, <python>, <output>, <answer>) present in the rollout, reward of 0.125 is given, up to maximum of 0.5. 6 Strict: An additional reward of 0.5 is awarded if (1) all tags are present, (2) the internal order of opening/closing tags is correct, and (3) the overall structure follows the sequence: <think> <python> <output> <answer>.

The reward ranges from 0, i.e no python code or all python code resulted in compilation error to maximum of 1, i.e all python code executed successfully. Example Analysis Appendix shows two examples of ARTIST on complex math tasks. Across both examples, ARTIST demonstrates robust agentic reasoning process that tightly integrates language-based thinking with programmatic tool use. The model systematically decomposes complex math problems into logical steps, alternates between internal reasoning and external computation, and iteratively refines its approach based on intermediate results. key strength of ARTIST is the emergence of advanced agentic reasoning capabilities: Self-Refinement: The model incrementally adjusts its strategy, such as increasing candidate values or restructuring code, to converge on correct solution. Self-Correction: When encountering errors (e.g., tool execution failures or incorrect intermediate results), the model diagnoses the issue and adapts its subsequent actions accordingly. Self-Reflection: At each step, the model evaluates and explains its reasoning, validating results through repeated computation or cross-verification. These capabilities are not explicitly supervised, but arise naturally from the agentic rollout structure and reward design in ARTIST. As result, the model is able to solve complex, multi-step mathematical problems with high reliability, leveraging both its language understanding and external tools. This highlights the effectiveness of reinforcement learning with tool integration for enabling flexible, adaptive, and interpretable problem-solving in LLMs. See Appendix for more details. 3.2 Multi-Turn Function Calling with Agentic Reasoning and Tool Use Function calling is core capability in agentic LLM applications, enabling models to answer user queries by invoking external functions to fetch information, perform deterministic operations, or automate workflows. In an agentic setup, access to suite of functions and their responses forms an interactive environment for LLM agents. This paradigm is increasingly relevant for real-world automation, especially with the adoption of standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Hou et al. [2025] that streamline tool and context integration for LLMs. In this work, we focus on enhancing LLMs ability to perform multi-turn, multi-function tasksscenarios that require the agent to coordinate multiple function calls, manage intermediate state, and interact with users over extended dialogues. We evaluate ARTIST on BFCL v3 Yan et al. [2024] and τ Bench Yao et al. [2024], two challenging benchmarks that require long-context reasoning, multiple user interactions, and cascaded function calls (see Experimental setup for more details). Prompt Template To maximize performance, we prompt the model to explicitly reason step by step using <reasoning>...</reasoning> tags before issuing function calls within <tool>...</tool> tags. This structure encourages the model to articulate its logic, plan tool use, and adaptively respond to environment feedback. The prompt is provided in Appendix A. Reward Design We employ two reward components tailored to the function calling setting. Each is designed to reinforce critical aspect of agentic reasoning and tool use: State Reward: This reward encourages the model to maintain and update the correct state throughout multi-turn interaction. In the context of function calling, State_match is the 7 number of state variables (e.g., current working directory, selected files, user preferences) that the model correctly tracks or updates, while State_total is the total number of relevant state variables for the task. For example, if the model needs to keep track of which files have been selected and which have been compressed, correctly maintaining both would yield higher state reward. The reward is scaled by SRmax (set to 0.5), the maximum possible state reward: Rstate = SRmax"

            "content": "This reward ensures the agent maintains coherent context and does not lose track of important information across multiple tool calls. Function Reward: This reward incentivizes the model to issue the correct sequence of function calls. Here, Functions_matched is the number of function calls that match the expected calls (in terms of both function name and arguments), and Functions_total is the total number of function calls required for the task. For example, if task requires three specific function calls (listing files, compressing, and emailing), and the model gets two correct, it receives partial credit. Rmax (set to 0.5) is the maximum function reward: Rfunction = Rmax unctionsmatched unctionstotal This reward encourages the agent to plan and execute the correct sequence of actions, mirroring how human would follow checklist to complete task. Format Reward: To encourage structured outputs, we provide both relaxed and strict format rewards: Relaxed: For the two required tag pairs (<reasoning>, <tool>) present in the rollout, reward of 0.025 is given, up to maximum of 0.1. Strict: An additional reward of 0.1 is awarded if (1) all tags are present, (2) the internal order of opening/closing tags is correct, and (3) the overall structure follows the sequence: <reasoning> <reasoning> <tool> <tool>. Example Analysis Appendix presents four representative examples of ARTIST on multi-turn function calling tasks drawn from the BFCLv3 and τ -Bench datasets. Across these diverse scenariosincluding sequential vehicle control, travel booking and cancellation, item exchange with preference handling, and persistent customer supportARTIST exhibits robust agentic reasoning process that tightly integrates step-by-step language-based planning with dynamic tool invocation in interactive environments. The model systematically interprets user requests, sequences and adapts multiple function calls, manages dependencies and state, handles ambiguous or incomplete information, and flexibly recovers from tool errors or workflow constraints. key strength of ARTIST is the emergence of advanced agentic reasoning capabilities: Self-Refinement: The model incrementally updates its plan in response to evolving requirements, user clarifications, or environment feedbacksuch as reordering actions, filtering options based on nuanced preferences, or skipping unnecessary steps to efficiently achieve the users goal. Self-Correction: When faced with tool execution errors, unmet preconditions, or mistaken assumptions (e.g., missing dependencies, unsupported tool actions, or incorrect order/item IDs), the model diagnoses the cause, executes corrective actions, and retries the intended operation without external intervention. Self-Reflection: At each stage, the model articulates its reasoning, summarizes the current state, confirms details with the user, and validates outcomes before proceeding, ensuring the overall workflow remains coherent, interpretable, and user-aligned. See Appendix for detailed analysis of the examples on multi-turn function calling tasks."

            "content": "4.1 Dataset and Evaluation Metrics We assess ARTIST in two key reasoning domains: complex mathematical problem solving and multi-turn function calling. For each setting, we detail the training and evaluation datasets, along with the metrics used to measure performance. 4.1.1 Complex Mathematical Reasoning Training Dataset We curate training set of 20,000 math word problems, primarily sourced from NuminaMath [LI et al., 2024]. The NuminaMath dataset spans wide range of complexity, from elementary arithmetic and algebra to advanced competition-level problems, ensuring the model is exposed to diverse question types and reasoning depths during training. Each problem is paired with ground-truth final answer, enabling outcome-based reinforcement learning without requiring intermediate step supervision. Evaluation Dataset To assess generalization and robustness, we evaluate on four established math benchmarks: MATH-500 [Hendrycks et al., 2021]: diverse set of 500 competition-style math problems. AIME [hug, a] and AMC [hug, b]: Standardized high school mathematics competition datasets. Olympiad Bench [He et al., 2024]: challenging set of olympiad-level problems requiring multi-step reasoning. Evaluation metrics We report Pass@1 accuracy: the percentage of problems for which the models final answer exactly matches the ground truth. This metric reflects the models ability to arrive at correct solution in single attempt. 4.1.2 Multi-Turn Function Calling Training Dataset For multi-turn function calling, we use subset of 100 annotated tasks from the base multi-turn category of BFCL v3 (Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard) as the training dataset. The remaining 100 annotated tasks are used as validation dataset. Each task requires the agent to issue and coordinate multiple function calls in response to user queries, often involving state tracking and error recovery. Evaluation Datasets We evaluate on two major benchmarks: BFCL v3 [Yan et al., 2024]: This benchmark covers range of domains (vehicle control, trading bots, travel booking, file systems, and cross-functional APIs) and includes several subcategories: Missing parameters: Tasks where the agent must identify and request missing information. Missing function: Scenarios where no available function can fulfill the users request. Long context: Tasks with extended, information-dense user interactions. τ -bench [Yao et al., 2024]: conversational benchmark simulating realistic user-agent dialogues in airline (50 tasks) and retail (115 tasks) domains. The agent must use domainspecific APIs and follow policy guidelines to achieve predefined goal state in the system database. Evaluation Metric We use Pass@1 accuracy, defined as the fraction of tasks for which the agents final response is correct and the resulting environment state matches the benchmarks ground truth. 9 4.2 Implementation Details Complex Mathematical Reasoning We train ARTIST using the Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct [Qwen et al., 2025] and Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct [Qwen et al., 2025] models. For each training instance, we sample 6 reasoning rollouts per question with temperature of 1.0 to encourage exploration. Following prior work [Xu et al., 2025], we set high generation budget of 8,000 tokens to accommodate long-form, multi-step reasoning. During rollouts, the model alternates between text generation and tool invocation, using Python interpreter as the external tool. The interpreter executes code via Pythons exec() function, and returns structured feedback to the model, including successful outputs, missing print statements, or detailed error messages. Multi-Turn Function Calling For multi-turn function calling, we use Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the base model. Training is performed with GRPO, sampling 8 rollouts per question at temperature of 1.0. Each rollout consists of multiple tool calls and their outputs, with the number of user turns per task set to 1 to control rollout complexity. The system returns the output of each function call in <tool_result> tags, including explicit failure messages when applicable. The maximum context window is set to 16384 tokens, and the maximum response length per rollout is 2048 tokens. Losses for rollouts which exceed the maximum completion length are masked. See Appendix for additional details, including batch size, optimizer settings, learning rate schedule, hardware specifications, and the exact formatting of tool outputs and error handling1. 4.3 Baselines To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of ARTIST, we compare its performance against comprehensive set of baselines spanning four distinct categories in both complex mathematical reasoning and multi-turn function calling tasks. This diverse selection ensures fair and thorough assessment of ARTISTs capabilities relative to both state-of-the-art and widely used approaches. Frontier LLMs (Frontier): Leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o [OpenAI, 2024] and DeepSeek R1 [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025], representing the current state-of-the-art in large-scale language modeling and serving as strong upper bounds for text-based and reasoning performance. Open-Source Tool-Augmented LLMs (Tool-OS): Models such as Numina [Beeching et al., 2024], ToRA [Gou et al., 2024], and PAL [Gao et al., 2023], which are designed to leverage external tools or code execution. These models are directly relevant for comparison with ARTISTs tool-augmented approach. Base LLMs (Base): Standard open-source models such as Qwen 2.5-7B and Qwen 2.5-14B, evaluated in their vanilla form without tool augmentation. These provide transparent, reproducible, and widely adopted baseline. Base LLMs + External Tools with Prompt Modifications (Base-Prompt+Tools): Base LLMs equipped with access to external tools, but relying on prompt engineering or reasoning token modifications (e.g., explicit tool-use instructions or reasoning tags). This tests the effectiveness of prompt-based tool integration and reasoning."

ARTIST consistently outperforms all baselines, especially on complex tasks. over all baseline categories. For example, on AMC, Qwen2.5-7B-ARTIST achieves 0.47 Pass@1, outperforming the base model (0.35) by +12.0%, the prompt-based tool baseline (0.349) by +12.1%, and the best open-source tool-augmented baseline (NuminaMath-TIR, 0.24) by +23.0%. The gains are even larger for Qwen2.5-14B-ARTIST, which achieves 0.55 on AMC an absolute improvement of +22.0% over the base model and +14.0% over the prompt-based tool baseline. Similar trends are observed on AIME and Olympiad. On AIME, Qwen2.5-7B-ARTIST improves over the base model by +11.6% (0.156 vs. 0.04), and over the prompt-based tool baseline by +3.4% (0.156 vs. 0.122). On Olympiad, the improvements are +16.9% over the base (0.379 vs. 0.21) and +1.3% over the prompt-based tool baseline (0.379 vs. 0.366). For Qwen2.5-14B-ARTIST, the gains are even more pronounced: +18.0% on Olympiad (0.42 vs. 0.24) and +6.2% on AIME (0.122 vs. 0.06) compared to base model. Similarly, when compared with Base-Prompt+Tools, Qwen2.5-14B-ARTIST we see boost of 14% on AMC, 5.5% on MATH-500, 5.9% on olympiad and 2.2% on AIME. Compared to open-source tool-augmented LLMs, ARTIST achieves up to +35.9% improvement over PAL on Olympiad and +9.6% over NuminaMath-TIR on AIME. These results highlight that as the complexity of the reasoning task increases, the advantages of dynamic tool use and agentic reasoning become more significant. ARTIST is able to decompose complex problems, invoke external computation when needed, and iteratively refine its solutionscapabilities that are critical for high-level competition math (see Figure 3). MATH-500: Internal Knowledge vs. Tool Use On MATH-500, which contains broader mix of problem difficulties but is generally less challenging than AMC, AIME, or Olympiad, the absolute improvements of ARTIST over baselines are more modest. For Qwen2.5-7B, ARTIST achieves 0.676, +5.6% improvement over the base model (0.62) and +4.7% over the prompt-based tool baseline (0.629). For Qwen2.5-14B, the gains are +2.6% over base (0.726 vs. 0.7) and +5.5% over the prompt-based tool baseline (0.726 vs. 0.671). This suggests that for less complex problems, the models internal knowledge is often sufficient, and the marginal benefit of agentic tool use is reduced (see Figure 4). Summary: ARTIST delivers the largest gains on the most complex benchmarks (AMC, AIME, Olympiad), where dynamic tool integration and multi-step agentic reasoning are essential, highlighting that RL-driven tool use is critical for solving advanced mathematical problems. Figure 3: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct: Performance on Math datasets. Figure 4: Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct: Performance on Math datasets. ARTIST vs. Base LLMs + External Tools with Prompt Modifications (Base-Prompt+Tools) Even though the base model with prompt modifications and tool access (Base-Prompt+Tools) is provided with the ability to call external tools, it consistently underperforms compared to ARTIST. Results indicate that, without explicit agentic training, the model struggles to learn when and how to invoke tools effectively, often failing to integrate tool outputs into the broader reasoning process. In contrast, ARTIST is explicitly trained to coordinate tool use within its reasoning chain, enabling it to leverage external computation in dynamic and context-aware manner. This highlights the importance of agentic reinforcement learning for teaching LLMs to not only access tools, but to strategically incorporate their capabilities to enhance overall problem-solving performance. Summary: Prompting base models to use tools yields limited improvements; explicit agentic RL training in ARTIST enables models to learn effective tool use, resulting in up to 12.1% higher accuracy on AMC and consistently superior performance across all tasks. ARTIST vs. Open-Source Tool-Augmented LLMs (Tool-OS) Compared to tool-integrated baselines such as ToRA, NuminaMath-TIR, ToRA-Code, and PAL, ARTIST achieves substantial improvements at the same model scale. For Qwen2.5-7B, ARTIST outperforms ToRA-7B by an average of 26.7% (15.25% 42%), NuminaMath-TIR by 16.5% (25.5% 42%), ToRA-Code by 24% (18% 42%), and PAL by 37.7% (4.25% 42%) across all benchmarks. These gains highlight that RL-driven agentic reasoning enables more effective and adaptive tool use than approaches relying on tool finetuning or inference-only tool integration. Summary: RL-based agentic training in ARTIST enables LLMs to integrate and reason with tools far more effectively than prior tool-augmented methods, yielding double-digit accuracy improvements across challenging math tasks. ARTIST vs. Frontier LLMs (Frontier) ARTIST outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks, even at the 7B scale, with absolute gains of 8.9% on Olympiad (37.9% vs. 29%), 7.6% on AIME (15.6% vs. 8%), 4.6% on MATH-500 (67.6% vs. 63%), and 4% on AMC (47% vs. 43%). At 14B, the gap widens further, with improvements of 13% on Olympiad, 12% on AMC, 9.6% on MATH-500, and 4.2% on AIME. While DeepSeek-R1 and its distilled variant perform strongly, they require large teacher models or additional supervised alignment, whereas ARTIST achieves competitive results using only outcome-based RL and tool integration. Incorporating such techniques could further enhance ARTIST, which we leave for future work. Summary: ARTIST surpasses state-of-the-art frontier models like GPT-4o on all math benchmarks, demonstrating that agentic RL with tool integration can close and even exceed the performance gap with much larger proprietary models. 5.1.2 Metrics We evaluate the effectiveness of ARTIST using three key metrics: (1) Reward Score (solution quality), (2) Number of Tool Calls (external tool utilization), and (3) Response Length (reasoning depth). Figure 5 compares ARTIST with the Base-Prompt+Tools across these dimensions. 12 Figure 5: Average reward score, Tool call and the response length metric across all math datasets (ARTIST vs. Base-Prompt+Tools). Reward Score (Solution Quality) ARTIST dramatically improves solution quality, as measured by the reward score, on both AMC and AIME datasets. For example, on AMC, the average reward score nearly triples from 0.9 (Base-Prompt+Tools) to 2.8 (ARTIST), while on AIME it quadruples from 0.4 to 1.7. On Olympiad, ARTIST improves the reward score from 2.4 to 2.6, and on MATH 500, from 2.9 to 3.3. This reflects ARTISTs ability to produce more correct, well-structured, and complete solutions, especially on challenging problems. Number of Tool Calls (External Tool Utilization) ARTIST learns to invoke external tools far more frequently and strategically than the baseline, particularly on harder datasets. On AIME, the base model averages only 0.3 tool calls per query, whereas ARTIST averages over 3 tool calls per query. On Olympiad, ARTISTs tool usage is slightly lower than the baseline, but remains high and effective for solving complex tasks. Interestingly, on MATH 500, ARTIST reduces tool usage compared to the baseline, suggesting that it selectively avoids unnecessary tool calls when internal reasoning suffices. This adaptive and context-sensitive tool usage is strongly correlated with improved reward scores, demonstrating that dynamic tool invocation based on difficulty of dataset is critical for solving complex problems. Response Length (Reasoning Depth) ARTIST generates substantially longer and more detailed responses, with average response length up to twice that of the baseline, especially on AIME. This increase in length indicates that ARTIST engages in more thorough, multi-step reasoning, rather than shortcutting to an answer. On Olympiad, response length increases moderately, reflecting deeper reasoning. However, on MATH 500, the response lengths are roughly comparable between ARTIST and the baseline, indicating that ARTIST maintains concise reasoning when appropriate without sacrificing quality. Overall the richer reasoning traces produced by ARTIST directly contribute to its superior performance on complex mathematical problems. Summary: These metrics collectively demonstrate that ARTIST not only achieves higher solution quality, but does so by leveraging external tools more effectively and engaging in deeper, more interpretable reasoning. 5.2 Results: Multi-Turn Function Calling We evaluate ARTIST on two challenging multi-turn function calling benchmarks: τ -bench (Airline and Retail domains) and BFCL v3 (Missing Function, Missing Parameters, and Long Context subsets). These benchmarks test the agents ability to reason over extended dialogues, manage state, and coordinate multiple tool calls under realistic and adversarial conditions. 5.2.1 Quantitative Results and Comparison Table 2 reports Pass@1 accuracy across five challenging benchmarks: τ -bench (Airline, Retail) and BFCL v3 (Missing Parameters, Missing Function, Long Context). ARTIST vs. Base LLMs ARTIST delivers consistent and substantial improvements over base LLMs without explicit agentic reasoning or tool integration.

ARTIST consistently outperforms baselines, especially on complex tasks.*Llama-3.1-70B was used for BFCLv3 evaluation. ARTIST 0.260 (Airline) and 0.240 (Retail), more than doubling the performance of the base model (0.120 and 0.180, respectively). On BFCL v3, ARTIST improves accuracy on Long Context by +9.0% (0.130 vs. 0.040), with smaller but consistent gains on Missing Function (+2.0%, 0.105 vs. 0.085) and Missing Parameters (+0.5%, 0.065 vs. 0.060). These results demonstrate that agentic RL with tool integration enables the model to better manage multi-step workflows, recover from errors, and maintain context over extended interactions. ARTIST vs. Base LLMs + Reasoning via Prompt (Base-Prompt+Tools) Compared to promptbased reasoning, ARTIST shows clear gains, particularly on the hardest tasks. On τ -bench, ARTIST outperforms the prompt baseline by +14.0% (Airline, 0.260 vs. 0.120) and +4.0% (Retail, 0.240 vs. 0.200). On BFCL v3, the improvement is most pronounced on Long Context (+7.5%, 0.130 vs. 0.055), while performance is comparable on Missing Function and Missing Parameters. This highlights that, as with math, prompt engineering alone is insufficient for robust multi-turn tool use; explicit RL-based agentic training is crucial for learning when and how to invoke tools in complex, evolving scenarios (see Figure 6). ARTIST vs. Frontier and Open-Source LLMs (FRONT) While GPT-4o achieves the highest scores on most BFCL v3 subsets (e.g., 0.410 on Missing Function, 0.545 on Long Context), ARTIST narrows the gap and in some cases outperforms much larger open-source models. For example, on BFCL v3 Long Context, ARTIST (0.130) surpasses Meta-Llama-3-70B [Aaron Grattafiori, 2024] (0.095) and Deepseek-R1 (0.115), and matches or exceeds Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct on Missing Function and Parameters. On τ -bench, ARTIST more than doubles the performance of Meta-Llama-370B [Aaron Grattafiori, 2024] (0.260 vs. 0.148 on Airline; 0.240 vs. 0.144 on Retail), despite being much smaller model. These results demonstrate the scalability and generalization of agentic RL with tool integration. Summary: ARTIST achieves the largest gains on the most challenging tasks (Long Context, Airline), where multi-turn reasoning, context tracking, and adaptive tool use are critical. Its ability to maintain state, recover from errors, and flexibly invoke external tools leads to substantial outperformance over base and prompt-based baselines, demonstrating that explicit agentic RL training is essential for robust, context-aware tool use and reliable function calling in complex environments. 5.2.2 Metrics Analysis for Multi-Turn Function Calling We evaluate the effectiveness of ARTIST using correctness reward score (state reward + function reward) on BFCL v3 during training, and three key metrics on τ -bench: (1) reasoning length per tool call, (2) total correct tool calls, and (3) total steps to task completion. 14 Figure 6: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct: Performance on τ -bench and BFCL v3 datasets for Multi-turn Function calling. Figure 7: Average reward score at different training steps for BFCL v3. Reward Score (BFCL v3). Figure 7 shows how reward score improves on both train and eval sets during training. During training on BFCL v3, ARTISTs average reward score improves from 0.55 to 0.85 within 900 steps. On evaluation, the reward score rises from 0.58 to 0.72 (a relative gain of 24%), demonstrating robust generalization and effective learning of tool-use strategies. Evaluation Metrics on τ -bench. Figure 8 compares ARTIST and Base-Prompt+Tools on τ - bench in terms of reasoning length per tool call, total correct tool calls, and total steps to task completion, capturing both reasoning depth and tool-use efficiency. Reasoning Length per Tool Call: ARTIST achieves an average of 253 tokens per tool call, compared to 190.5 for Base-Prompt+Tools 33% increase. This indicates that ARTIST develops richer, more context-aware reasoning before each tool invocation, suggesting deeper understanding of why each tool call is performed. Total Correct Tool Calls: ARTIST makes 676 correct tool calls to complete all tasks, compared to 517 for Base-Prompt+Tools 30% increase. This higher number of correct Figure 8: Metrics Analysis for Multi-Turn Function Calling on τ -bench. 15 tool invocations directly translates to substantial improvement in overall task completion, with ARTIST nearly doubling the accuracy of Base-Prompt+Tools on τ -bench. Total Steps to Completion: Despite more frequent tool use, ARTIST completes all tasks in just 1284 steps, versus 1520 for Base-Prompt+Tools 15% reduction. This efficiency is due to ARTISTs ability to make the right tool calls at the right time, reducing unnecessary interactions and converging to solutions more quickly. Summary: ARTIST achieves higher reward scores, richer reasoning, more correct tool calls, and faster task completion for multi-turn function calling. These results highlight the practical benefits of agentic RL: enabling LLMs to reason more deeply, use tools more effectively, and solve complex multi-turn tasks with greater efficiency than prompt-based baselines."

            "content": "The reasoning space for large language models (LLMs) broadly encompasses: (1) chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and structured reasoning, (2) tool-based reasoning and integration, and (3) reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning and alignment. While each of these areas has advanced LLM capabilities in isolation, the intersectionagentic reasoning with dynamic tool integration via RLremains underexplored. Below, we review each area and highlight their unique contributions. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Prompting Approaches Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [Wei et al., 2023] has emerged as foundational technique for enhancing LLM reasoning by encouraging models to generate explicit intermediate steps. CoT and its variants [Wang et al., 2023, Cai et al., 2023] have demonstrated that breaking down complex problems into smaller subproblems improves accuracy and interpretability. However, CoT primarily leverages the models internal knowledge and linguistic capabilities, which can be insufficient for tasks requiring up-to-date information, precise computation, or external action [Turpin et al., 2023]. This limitation motivates the integration of external tools and environments to augment LLM reasoning. Tool-Based Reasoning Tool-based reasoning [Inaba et al., 2023, Zhuang et al., 2023] extends LLM capabilities by enabling access to external resources such as web search, code interpreters, and APIs. Approaches like PAL [Gao et al., 2023] use prompting to guide models in generating code for external execution, while frameworks such as ART [Paranjape et al., 2023] and ToRA [Gou et al., 2024] train LLMs to invoke tools as part of their reasoning process. Toolformer [Schick et al., 2023] demonstrates self-supervised tool use via API calls. While these methods showcase the potential of tool integration, they often rely on high-quality labeled trajectories or handcrafted prompts, which limit scalability and adaptability. Moreover, tool use is frequently decoupled from the models reasoning process, especially during training, reducing the effectiveness of tool integration in dynamic or multi-turn scenarios. RL-Based Reasoning Reinforcement learning (RL) [Kaelbling et al., 1996] has emerged as powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In the context of large language models, RL was introduced through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF [Ouyang et al., 2022]), which aligns model outputs with human preferences by fine-tuning the model using feedback from human evaluators. While foundational algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [Schulman et al., 2017] established the paradigm of policy optimization with clipped objectives and reward normalization, subsequent innovations like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [Rafailov et al., 2024] simplified alignment by directly optimizing preference data without explicit reward modeling. More recently, methods like Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) [Meng et al., 2024] further streamlines the process by using the average log probability of sequence as an implicit reward, removing the necessity for reference model and enhancing training stability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [Shao et al., 2024] represents significant advancement in RL-based reasoning enhancement, addressing key limitations of prior approaches. GRPO eliminates the need for value function by estimating baselines from group scores, significantly reducing training resources and has been effectively utilized in models like DeepSeekMath [Shao et al., 2024] and DeepSeek-R1 [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025], where it contributed to improved performance in mathematical reasoning tasks. GRPO has been shown to foster more robust and self-corrective chain-of-thought behaviors in models [Dao and Vu, 2025]. Reasoning and Agentic Systems Recent advances in LLMs have spurred significant progress in agentic systems [Plaat et al., 2025]models that can autonomously plan, adapt, and interact with external environments to solve complex tasks. Agentic reasoning [Wu et al., 2025] is increasingly recognized as critical capability for LLMs, enabling models to move beyond static, single-turn inference and instead engage in dynamic, multi-step decision making. This paradigm is essential for real-world applications where tasks are open-ended, require external information, or involve sequential tool use and adaptation. Concurrently to our work, few recent papers have explored integrating external tools into the reasoning process. For example, R1-Searcher [Song et al., 2025] and ReSearch [Chen et al., 2025] incorporate search tools mid-reasoning, primarily for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks such as question answering. Retool [Feng et al., 2025] leverages code interpreter as an external tool to solve math problems, but relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with additional annotated data, in contrast to our cold-start RL approach that requires no step-level supervision. Compared to these works, our framework is applied to more complex problems in agentic scenarios, tackling real-world settings that require dynamic tool use, multi-turn reasoning, and adaptive environment interaction. Most prior work either focuses on tool use in isolation often decoupled from the reasoning process or on RL for internal reasoning without external action. This gap is particularly acute in real-world, dynamic domains where models must flexibly decide not only what to think, but also when, how, and which tools to use. Our Contribution Our work addresses this gap by unifying agentic reasoning, tool integration, and RL in single framework. By leveraging outcome-based RL (GRPO) and treating tool use as first-class operation within the reasoning chain, ARTIST enables LLMs to learn adaptive, contextaware strategies for tool invocation and environment interaction. This approach moves beyond static prompting or isolated tool use, establishing new frontier for robust, generalizable, and interpretable agentic systems."

            "content": "This paper presents ARTIST, novel framework that unifies agentic reasoning, reinforcement learning, and dynamic tool integration, unlocking new levels of capability in large language models. By treating tool use and environment interaction as first-class operations within the reasoning process, ARTIST enables LLMs to autonomously plan, adapt, and solve complex multi-step tasks. Through extensive evaluation on mathematical and multi-turn function calling tasks, we show that models trained with ARTIST not only achieve higher accuracy, but also exhibit qualitatively richer behaviors such as adaptive tool selection, iterative self-correction, and deeper multi-step reasoning. These emergent capabilities arise without step-level supervision, underscoring the power of RL in teaching LLMs to orchestrate complex workflows in dynamic environments. Beyond performance gains, our analyses reveal that agentic RL training leads to more interpretable and robust reasoning traces, with models leveraging external tools in context-aware and purposeful manner. This marks shift from static, prompt-driven tool use toward genuinely autonomous, environment-interacting agents. Future work should explore scaling ARTIST to even more diverse domains, integrating richer forms of feedback (including human preferences), and addressing safety and reliability in open-ended environments. We hope our findings inspire further research at the intersection of agentic reasoning, RL, and tool-augmented LLMs, paving the way for more adaptive, trustworthy, and general-purpose AI systems."

Training is performed using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with batch size of 8 and learning rate of 106. We use the Adam optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.99, and weight decay of 0.01. Each training instance samples 6 rollouts per question with temperature of 1.0. Maximum response length is set to 8,000 tokens. Due to computation efficiency we trained Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct upto 100 steps. Rollout and Tool Execution. During each rollout, the model alternates between text generation and tool invocation. Python code is executed using the built-in exec() function. Tool feedback is categorized as: Successful execution with output: Output is returned with Compiled Successfully message. Successful execution without output: The tool returns Compiled Successfully, however the print statement is missing therefore output is empty. 23 Failed execution: Compilation errors are returned with the error message. Hardware. All experiments are conducted on 4A100 80 GB GPUs, with total training time of 20 hours. C.2 Multi-Turn Function Calling Model and Training. We use Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the base model, trained with GRPO. Batch size is set to 8 per GPU with 3 GPUs used for training, with learning rate of 106 and Adam optimizer (β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.99, weight decay 0.01). The gradients are accumulated every 4 steps to improve stability. The learning rate schedule is constant with 20 warm-up steps. We sample 8 rollouts per question at temperature of 0.9. Maximum context window is 16384 tokens, and maximum response length per rollout is 2048 tokens. Rollout and Tool Execution. Each rollout consists of multiple tool calls and outputs, with user turn counts set to either 1. Tool outputs are returned in <tool_result> tags. If function call fails, the failure reason is explicitly returned to the model for self-correction. Hardware. Training is performed on 4A100 80 GB GPUs, with total training time of 34 hours. Reproducibility. Our codebase is built on Verl [verl, 2024] and verifier [Brown, 2025] librares. All code, hyperparameters, and configuration files will be released upon publication to ensure reproducibility. Case Study: Complex Math Reasoning Tasks D.1 Example-1 In this example, ARTIST is tasked with determining the smallest such that the probability of drawing red apple times in row from box of 11 apples (10 red, 1 non-red) is less than 0.5. The model must reason through multi-step combinatorial probability problem that is challenging to solve accurately with text-based reasoning alone. Key Steps and Reasoning Process: - The model begins by breaking down the problem into sequence of conditional probabilities, expressing the overall probability as product of fractions that decrease with each draw. - It then translates this reasoning into Python code snippet, leveraging the external interpreter to compute the probability for candidate value of n. - Upon receiving the output, the model evaluates whether the condition is met. If not, it reflects on the result, incrementally adjusts n, and repeats the computation. - This iterative process continues until the model finds the smallest such that the probability drops below 0.5, at which point it outputs the answer. Emergent Agentic Capabilities: - Self-Refinement: The model systematically increases and refines its approach based on the results of each computation, demonstrating trial-and-error strategy that is typical of human problemsolving. - Self-Correction: After each computation, the model checks whether the probability satisfies the required condition. If not, it recognizes the need to adjust its previous assumption and re-executes the computation with an updated value. - Self-Reflection: The model explicitly reasons about the intermediate results, articulating why given value of does or does not satisfy the problem constraints, and uses this reflection to guide its next action. Take away: This example shows how ARTIST empowers LLMs to solve complex, multi-step math problems by seamlessly combining reasoning with tool use. The models iterative tool invocation, result interpretation, and adaptive strategy demonstrate robust agentic reasoning. Notably, selfrefinement, self-correction, and self-reflection emerge naturally from the agentic process and reward designwithout explicit supervisionhighlighting the strength of RL-driven tool integration. 24 Question : box contains 11 apples , 10 of which are red . An apple is drawn from the box and its color is noted before it is eaten . This is done total of times , and the probability that red apple is drawn each time is less than 0.5. What is the smallest possible value of ? < think > The box contains 10 red apples and 1 apple that is not red . The probability of drawing red apple the first time is 10/11. After drawing red apple , there are 9 red apples and 1 non - red apple left , making the probability of drawing red apple again (9/10) . This process continues until the last apple is drawn . We are asked for the smallest value of such that the probability of drawing red apple each time is less than 0.5. The probability of drawing red apple times can be represented by the product : ( ) = (10/11) * (9/10) * (8/9) * ... * ((10 - +1) /(11 - +1) ) . We need to find the smallest such that ( ) < 0.5. </ think > < python > </ python > import sympy = 2 p_n = 1 for in range (1 , +1) : p_n *= (10 - +1) /(11 - +1) print ( p_n ) < output > Compiled successfully .

The model must apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion, perform arithmetic, and handle intermediate errors. Key Steps and Reasoning Process: - The model first reasons through the inclusion-exclusion formula, clearly articulating each step and variable. - It generates Python code to compute the number of students in at least one course, then uses another code block to add the students in neither course. - When variable scope error occurs (due to stateless tool execution), the model recognizes the issue, reflects on the mistake, and rewrites the code to ensure all variables are defined in single block. - The model repeats the calculation to confirm the result, providing additional verification before producing the final answer. Emergent Agentic Capabilities: - Self-Refinement: The model iteratively improves its approach, re-running the computation after encountering an error. - Self-Correction: Upon detecting compilation error, the model diagnoses the cause and corrects its code, demonstrating robust error recovery. - Self-Reflection: The model explicitly reflects on intermediate results and validates its solution by confirming the calculation multiple times. Question : In class of some students , 18 take chorus , 26 take band , and 2 take both chorus and band . There are 8 students in the class not enrolled in either chorus or band . How many students are there in the class ? < think > To find the number of students in the class , we can use the principle of inclusion - exclusion for counting the number of students taking at least one of the two courses . The formula is : [ cup = + - cap ] where : - $ $ is the number of students taking chorus (18) , - $ $ is the number of students taking band (26) , - $ cap $ is the number of students taking both chorus and band (2) , - cup is the number of students taking at least one of the two . Then subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many are not enrolled in either course . Let say the total number of students in the class is $X$ . We know that : [ = cup + text { students not enrolled in either } ] First we calculate the number of students taking at least one course with the formula , and then we add the 8 students who are not in either course to find the total number of students . Let calculate $ cup $ . </ think > < python > import sympy students_chorus = 18 students_band = 26 students_both = 2 d s _ _ s _ _ r = students_chorus + students_band - students_both print ( d s _ _ s _ _ r ) </ python > < output > Compiled successfully . Output : 42 </ output > < think > We have calculated that 42 students take at least one of the two courses .

            "content": "E.1 Example-1 In this example, ARTIST is tasked to ensure all car doors are locked and to start the engine in START mode for user preparing to drive. The agent must coordinate several function calls using the VehicleControlAPI, handle dependencies (such as pressing the brake pedal before starting the engine), and adapt its actions based on feedback from the environment. Key Steps and Reasoning Process: ARTIST begins by reasoning that it should first secure all car doors, so it issues function call to lock every door. After confirming that all doors are locked, the agent attempts to start the engine by calling the appropriate function. However, the environment returns an error indicating that the brake pedal must be pressed first. Recognizing this dependency, ARTIST adapts its plan: it calls the function to press the brake pedal, confirms the action succeeded, and then retries starting the engine. This time, the engine starts successfully, and the agent informs the user that the car is ready to go. Emergent Agentic Capabilities: - Self-Refinement: The agent dynamically updates its plan as new requirements emerge, seamlessly moving from locking doors to handling engine start prerequisites. - Self-Correction: Upon encountering an error (the engine cannot start without pressing the brake pedal), the agent diagnoses the issue, executes the necessary corrective action, and retries the original goal. 27 - Self-Reflection: The agent articulates its reasoning at each step, communicates dependencies and status updates, and validates its actions based on environment feedback. This example showcases how ARTIST empowers LLMs to handle multi-step, multi-function tasks in dynamic environments. The agents ability to plan, adapt, and recover from errorswithout explicit supervisiondemonstrates robust agentic reasoning, highlighting the practical value of RL-driven tool integration for real-world automation.

The agent must coordinate multiple function calls using the TravelAPI, handle tool errors, and ensure all user requirements are met in sequence. Key Steps and Reasoning Process ARTIST begins by reasoning through the users request, identifying the need to estimate the trip cost, book the flight, and then cancel the booking. The agent first attempts to confirm the flight cost by calling the get_flight_cost function, but encounters an error due to an incorrect argument (access_token). Despite this, ARTIST proceeds by booking the flight using the correct parameters, successfully obtaining booking ID. Recognizing the users need to cancel immediately, the agent then issues cancel_booking call with the appropriate booking ID and access token. Each step is accompanied by clear reasoning and adaptation to tool feedback, ensuring the task is completed as intended. Emergent Agentic Capabilities Self-Refinement: The agent adapts its plan in real time, skipping the failed cost estimation and moving directly to booking and cancellation, ensuring the users core objectives are met. Self-Correction: Upon encountering tool execution error (unexpected keyword argument), the agent does not halt but instead adjusts its subsequent function calls to avoid the same mistake. Self-Reflection: The agent explicitly communicates each step, summarizes booking and cancellation details, and confirms successful completion, demonstrating awareness of both intermediate results and final task requirements. This example highlights how ARTIST empowers LLMs to handle complex, multi-step function calling tasks in dynamic environments. The agents ability to adapt to tool errors, recover gracefully, and maintain clear communication demonstrates robust agentic reasoning. These capabilitiesemerging naturally from RL-driven tool integrationunderscore the practical value of ARTIST for real-world automation and workflow orchestration.

The user does not have the order ID or item IDs at hand, and expresses nuanced preferences for the replacements (a bigger water bottle and less bright, battery-powered desk lamp). The agent must identify the correct user and orders, retrieve item details, filter product options, confirm payment, and execute the exchange, all while handling ambiguous information and user clarifications through multi-turn dialogue. Key Steps and Reasoning Process ARTIST begins by clarifying the users identity and order context, requesting the users name and zip code to find the user ID. Upon retrieving the user ID, the agent proceeds to obtain the users recent orders and infers which orders likely contain the items to be exchanged. When the user cannot specify the order ID, ARTIST queries the order details to identify which orders contain the desk lamp and water bottle, confirming with the user as needed. Once the correct order and item IDs are determined, the agent helps the user select suitable replacement for the desk lamp by filtering available product variants according to the users preferences (lower brightness, battery-powered). ARTIST presents the filtered options, confirms the users choice, and verifies the payment method on file. Before executing the exchange, the agent summarizes all relevant detailsorder ID, items to be exchanged, new item IDs, and payment methodand seeks explicit confirmation from the user. After receiving confirmation, ARTIST completes the exchange via the appropriate tool call, then communicates the successful status update and next steps to the user. Emergent Agentic Capabilities Self-Refinement: The agent incrementally narrows down the correct order and item IDs, adapts its plan as new information emerges, and dynamically filters product options to match nuanced user preferences (e.g., brightness, power source). Self-Correction: When initial assumptions about the order or item location are incorrect, the agent diagnoses the mismatch, queries additional details, and redirects its actions to accurately identify the target items. Self-Reflection: At each step, the agent summarizes its understanding, confirms details with the user, and validates choices before proceeding, ensuring transparent and user-aligned workflow. \" instruction \": \" You are mei_kovacs_8020 ( zip code 28236) and you want to exchange the water bottle and the desk lamp .

The user is persistent about adding insurance, does not want to be transferred to another agent, and expects the agent to resolve the issue directly. The agent must clarify the booking status, handle user insistence, navigate tool limitations, and ensure the users request is fulfilled. Key Steps and Reasoning Process ARTIST begins by gathering the reservation details using the provided reservation ID. Upon inspection, the agent finds that insurance was not included in the original booking. The agent communicates this to the user and offers to add insurance for an additional fee. When the user insists that insurance was already selected, the agent reviews the confirmation details, reiterates the absence of insurance, and persistently offers to add it. Despite encountering tool limitation (no direct method to update insurance), ARTIST adapts by re-booking the reservation with insurance included and processes the payment for the additional coverage. Throughout, the agent maintains clear, step-by-step communication, confirms user intent, and avoids transferring the user to another agent, as instructed. Emergent Agentic Capabilities Self-Refinement: The agent persistently re-examines the reservation, adapts its approach when direct insurance update is unavailable, and finds an alternative solution (re-booking with insurance). Self-Correction: Upon encountering tool error (unsupported action for updating insurance), the agent diagnoses the limitation and pivots to valid workflow, ensuring the users request is still fulfilled. Self-Reflection: At each stage, the agent summarizes findings, confirms user preferences, and validates actions before proceeding, maintaining transparency and user trust throughout the interaction. This example demonstrates how ARTIST enables LLMs to handle persistent, nuanced user requests in constrained environments. The agents ability to clarify context, adapt to tool limitations, recover from failed actions, and maintain user-centric communication exemplifies robust agentic reasoning. These capabilitiesemerging naturally from RL-driven tool integrationhighlight the effectiveness of ARTIST for real-world customer support and workflow automation. \" instruction \": \" Your user id is so ph ia_ ta yl or_ 9065 .
