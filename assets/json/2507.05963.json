            "content": "Recent research efforts [13, 3941] have investigated the generation of customized video content tailored to both appearance and motion. These approaches are classified into tuning-based methods [39, 41] and tuning-free methods [40]. Tuning-based methods optimize model parameters and manipulate attention maps for appearance adaptation and motion dynamics, while tuning-free methods learn subject appearance and motion patterns during training, enabling integration without additional fine-tuning. Despite notable progress, challenges remain. Primarily, the reliance on UNet architectures [30] limits application to emerging DiT models, reducing generation capabilities. Furthermore, current methods focus on single-entity customization, complicating the simultaneous manipulation of multiple entities with diverse motion control. To address these challenges, we propose Tora2, tuning-free DiT method specifically designed to maintain the fidelity of multiple entities while adhering to predefined motion trajectories. Existing open-set personalization approaches, such as Video Alchemist, predominantly utilize low-frequency global features extracted by DINOv2 [25] for appearance injection. However, due to the human eyes sensitivity to high-frequency details, reliance on lowfrequency information often leads to insufficient content similarity, particularly in multi-entity scenarios. To enhance this, we introduce decoupled personalization extractor (DPE) that integrates both lowand high-frequency details to create comprehensive personalization embeddings, thereby preserving fine-grained visual information more effectively. Specifically, high-frequency features are first extracted using facial analysis networks [7] and ReID networks [21], enabling human-specific and object-specific customization. Our experiments demonstrate that this decoupled approach improves consistency in human face representations. These features are transformed by appearance adapters, combined with global features, and queried using Q-Former network [19] to generate personalization embeddings. For multi-entity control, gated self-attention mechanism is utilized to fuse the personalization embeddings with corresponding motion embeddings and textual entity tokens. This mechanism enables the integration of appearance, motion, and textual information, ensuring effective learning across multiple entities. Additionally, we introduce contrastive learning framework to strengthen cross-modal alignment between the entities and the motion patterns extracted by Tora. To realize concurrent customization of motion and appearance, we integrate motion embeddings and personalization embeddings at distinct stages within the diffusion transformer. Specifically, motion embeddings are infused through an adaptive layer normalization [11] mechanism that modulates video latents prior to the 3D full-attention computation. Meanwhile, personalization embeddings are introduced via an independent cross-attention module positioned post the primary attention layer. Through systematic exploration of multiple embedding injection sequences, we validate that this hierarchical injection strategy achieves optimal generative performance in terms of both motion fidelity and identity preservation. In this work, we merge the data collection pipelines from Video Alchemist and Tora, creating dataset of 1.1 million video clips featuring diverse entities with fluid motion patterns, specifically curated for training Tora2. Evaluation on the MSRVTT-Personalization benchmark [5] reveals that Tora2 excels in multi-entity video customization with precise trajectory control. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose Tora2, the first multi-entity customized video diffusion transformer framework. As shown in Figure 1, Tora2 allows for both appearance and motion trajectory control. Tora2: Motion and Appearance Customized Diffusion Transformer for Multi-Entity Video Generation MM 25, October 2731, 2025, Dublin, Ireland We introduce decoupled personalization extractor designed to learn fine-grained personalization embeddings for openset entities, enhancing both subject and face similarity in multi-entity generation.

Additionally, these features usu-\nally yield inadequate alignment with the representation space of\ndiffusion models.",
            "content": "To address these limitations, we propose decoupled personalization extractor. More specifically, we first utilize facial recognition and ReID backbones to extract identity-strong features for humanspecific and generic objects, respectively. Decoupling is justified by the sensitivity of our eyes to facial details, with experiments demonstrating that this method enhances facial similarity in our scenario. Two additional appearance adapters are then employed to project these high-frequency features into unified feature space. These identity-focused features are then concatenated with the features captured by the DINOv2 image encoder, which are semantically robust, thereby creating comprehensive visual representation: (cid:8)𝑣𝑖 𝑣𝑖 = Concat( 𝑓𝜃 (𝜀prior (𝐼𝑖 )), 𝜀img (𝐼𝑖 ) )(cid:9)𝑁 𝑖=1 where 𝜀𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟 denotes the corresponding pretrained class-specific recognition encoder and 𝑓𝜃 represents the appearance adapter. To facilitate better alignment with the diffusion transformer, we integrate learnable Q-Former architecture, which consists of stacked cross-attention layers and feedforward networks. The comprehensive visual representation is used as key-value corpus, and the Q-Former is leveraged to generate personalization embeddings for each concept: (3) , {𝑝𝑖 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑄 (𝑣𝑖 ), 𝑖 = 1 . . . 𝑁 } , (4) This approach significantly enhances the models ability to maintain high fidelity when processing multiple concepts simultaneously. Binding of entity with the word and trajectory. Empirical evidence [5] has shown that unbinding visual concepts from their corresponding textual descriptions leads to misalignment in multientity personalization. Therefore, linear projection is used to extend the personalization embeddings with textual information. Our framework extends this requirement to trajectory-conditioned generation, necessitating precise trimodal alignment between entity, text, and motion trajectory. We address this through gated selfattention that ensures spatially consistent allocation of customized entities along designated trajectories. For given personalization embedding 𝑝𝑖 𝑅𝑙𝑝 𝑑 , it is associated with trajectory characterized by motion embedding 𝑚𝑖 𝑅𝑙𝑚 𝑑 and word tokens 𝑐𝑖 𝑅𝑙𝑐 𝑑 . In this context, 𝑙𝑝 , 𝑙𝑚, 𝑙𝑐 , and 𝑑 denote the number of tokens per reference image, trajectory tokens, text tokens, and token dimensions, respectively. We initiate Tora2: Motion and Appearance Customized Diffusion Transformer for Multi-Entity Video Generation MM 25, October 2731, 2025, Dublin, Ireland the process by concatenating these three modal tokens and subsequently employ self-attention mechanism integrated with two gated mechanisms to facilitate cross-modal interaction: ˆ𝑝𝑖, ˆ𝑚𝑖, ˆ𝑐𝑖 = SelfAttention(Concat(𝑝𝑖, 𝑚𝑖, 𝑐𝑖 )), 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑝𝑖 + 𝐺𝑝 ( ˆ𝑝𝑖 ), 𝑚𝑖 = 𝑚𝑖 + 𝐺𝑚 ( ˆ𝑚𝑖 ), (5) where 𝐺𝑚 and 𝐺𝑝 denote the gate mechanisms for motion embeddings and personalization embeddings, respectively. Through gated cross-modal interaction, it dynamically modulates the fusion intensity, achieving an optimal balance among appearance preservation, textual description, and motion alignment for each entity. Personalization and motion injection. As shown in Figure 2, the motion conditions are introduced by the motion-guidance fuser, which employs an adaptive layer normalization to modulate the visual tokens. The concatenation of motion-normalized visual tokens and text tokens then undergoes 3D full attention to capture fine-grained relationships between textual descriptions and visual elements. To preserve the original foundational model knowledge, we apply additional cross-attention to facilitate interaction between the personalization embeddings and the visual tokens. In this manner, we inject the three modal conditions at different locations within the DiT blocks, achieving joint controllable video generation for multiple entities. Contrastive Loss. We also introduce dual-branch contrastive learning framework to strengthen cross-modal alignment between entities and motion patterns. Our contrastive objective enforces three properties: (1) semantic-motion correspondence through positive entity-motion pairing, (2) inter-concept discriminability via negative entity-entity pairs, and (3) motion trajectory distinction through negative motion-motion pairs. Formally, the loss can be described as: Lcont = 𝑖 log exp(p (cid:205)𝑗 exp(p 𝑖 m𝑖 /𝜏) 𝑖 m𝑗 /𝜏) log 𝑗 exp(m (cid:205)𝑖 exp(m 𝑗 p𝑗 /𝜏) 𝑗 p𝑖 /𝜏) , (6) where 𝜏 denotes the temperature hyperparameter. This symmetric formulation simultaneously ensures entity-specific motion binding while expanding separation between different personalization embeddings in the joint latent space. Finally, the specific diffusion process can be formulated as: Ltotal = L𝜖 + 𝜆Lcont, L𝜖 = E𝑡,𝑧0,𝜖 𝜖 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , 𝑡, 𝑐, 𝑝, 𝑚)2 2 , (7) (8) where 𝜆 denotes the weights of the contrastive loss."

Finally, videos that either lack subject entity words or contain subject entity words in plural form are removed to prevent ambiguity in personalization. This comprehensive filtering protocol ensures that the remaining videos are of high quality and content clarity, providing robust foundation for subsequent analytical processes. Video Annotation. We utilize Qwen2.5-Max [44] to extract nouns from the captions. Subsequently, we select three frames from the beginning, middle, and end of the video and use LISA [18] to extract entity masks. LISA provides highly accurate segmentation results, even for similar visual appearances and textual semantics. Masks that are too large, too small, or highly fragmented are removed.

Despite sharing the foundational video DiT model architecture, Tora2s motionconditioned training paradigm introduces additional complexity compared to the personalized feature learning approach of Video Alchemist. The comparable personalization performance indicates that our DPE effectively captures discriminative identity features under joint optimization with motion conditioning. Under motiondriven generation scenarios, while Video Alchemist does not provide implementation for trajectory accuracy evaluation, this capability is outside the scope of their methods design. The Tora + Flux.1 pipeline encounters substantial degradation in subject and identity fidelity, especially in facial areas, owing to the architectural limitations of separation control. While the fine-tuned Flux.1 model successfully initializes the first frame with strong reference alignment, the subsequent frames devolve because the framework lacks continuous personalization conditioning to anchor the generative process. Notably, Tora2s joint learning strategy for fusing motion dynamics and conceptual representations consistently achieves superior generation quality metrics across both identity and motion-conditioned tasks. Figure 3 illustrates comparative analysis of video generations produced by contrasting approaches. Due to its closed-source status, Video Alchemist results are not included in this evaluation. Tora + Flux.1 employs basic concatenation strategy for appearance and motion control.

Table 3 illustrates that the baseline architecture lacking explicit entity binding exhibits significant limitations, showing an additional 12.6-pixel offset in trajectory alignment and 1.5% reduction in subject similarity compared to our proposed method. This performance disparity manifests visually through erroneous associations between specified motion paths and irrelevant background elements, especially when processing prompts containing multiple entities. Figure 5 provides qualitative comparison results, clearly indicating that in the absence of binding strategy, the trajectory intended for the bird incorrectly results in moving the camera to the right, failing to control the bird as intended. In the linear projection variant, although it successfully associates trajectories, entities, and words, this relatively simple interaction does not represent the optimal choice for multi-entity association. Compared to our method, there is decrease of 1.0% in video similarity, as evidenced by deformation observed in both the cat and bird in the latter part of the video. Our gated attention architecture emerges as the optimal solution, effectively binding the entity with the corresponding trajectory while maintaining fidelity. The effect of contrastive loss. Table 4 quantitatively validates our contrastive learning strategy.

The ablation of the injection order for motion and personalization embeddings. The injection method for motion and personalization embeddings via adaptive layer normalization and crossattention has proven to be the most effective. We adhere to these advanced designs while exploring the injection order of these features. The findings, detailed in Table 5, suggest that injecting personalization embeddings early slightly reduces motion tracking fidelity. This occurs because early activation of the cross-attention mechanism disproportionately amplifies stylistic identity cues, thereby dampening the propagation of motion trajectory semantics throughout the diffusion process. As result, we have selected the motiontext-personalization injection order as our final architecture. This arrangement ensures nuanced signal flow: motion embeddings initially establish temporal dynamics, followed by text-based conditioning to maintain semantic integrity, and finally, personalization embeddings enhance appearance traits without sacrificing trajectory precision.

            "title": "5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce Tora2, a unified controllable video gen-\neration framework that effectively customizes multiple entities\nwith motion trajectory control. Tora2 utilizes a decoupled person-\nalization extractor to achieve open-set personalization embedding\nextraction by merging semantic features and high-frequency in-\ntrinsic features through a learned Q-Former framework. Addition-\nally, it employs a novel binding strategy to associate visual entities\nwith corresponding motion trajectories and textual words, ensuring\ncoherent control across different entities. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with\nstate-of-the-art customization methods while introducing advanced\nmotion trajectory control. These findings significantly enhance the\nexisting capabilities of controllable video generation processes.",
