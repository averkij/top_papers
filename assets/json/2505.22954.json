            "content": "Most of todays AI systems are constrained by human-designed, fixed architectures and cannot autonomously and continuously improve themselves. The scientific method, on the other hand, provides cumulative and open-ended system, where each innovation builds upon previous artifacts, enabling future discoveries. There is growing hope that the current manual process of advancing AI could itself be automated. If done safely, such automation would accelerate AI development and allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. This prospect raises the question of how AI systems can endlessly improve themselves while getting better at solving relevant problems. Previous approaches, such as meta-learning, provide toolset for automating the discovery of novel algorithms but are limited by the human design of suitable search space and first-order improvements. The Gödel machine [116], on the other hand, introduced theoretical approach to self-improving AI, capable of modifying itself in provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, this original formulation is in practice impossible to create due to the inability to prove the impact of most self-modifications. To address this limitation, we propose the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM), novel self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically validates each change using coding benchmarks. In this paper, the DGM aims to optimize the design of coding agents, powered by frozen foundation models, which enable the ability to read, write, and execute code via tool use. Inspired by biological evolution and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding agents. It then samples from this archive and tries to create new, interesting, improved version of the sampled agent. This open-ended exploration forms growing tree of diverse, high-quality agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management, peer-review mechanisms), producing performance increases on SWE-bench from 20.0% to 50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human oversight).

            "content": "Scientific progress is cumulative and open-ended, with each breakthrough standing on the shoulders of countless prior insights. In the same way, our most advanced AI systems are built upon long *co-authors co-senior authors Figure 1: Darwin Gödel Machine. The DGM iteratively builds growing archive of agents by interleaving self-modification with downstream task evaluation. Agents in the archive are selected for self-modification through open-ended exploration. lineage of innovations. For instance, transformers [131], the backbone of current large language models (LLMs) [14], did not emerge in isolation but were built upon years of past innovations, such as recurrent neural networks [51, 110] and attention mechanisms [7, 64, 101]. However, most of todays AI systems remain bound by fixed, human-designed architectures that learn within predefined boundaries, without the capacity to autonomously rewrite their own source code to self-improve. As result, each advancement in AI development still leans heavily on human interventions, tethering the pace of progress. This paper investigates the intriguing possibility of safely automating the search for ever-better AI. One can imagine an AI system that, like scientific discovery itself, becomes an engine of its own advancement: building upon its past, recursively improving, and propelling itself toward more advanced capabilities. Schmidhuber [116] presented class of mathematically rigorous, self-referential, self-improving problem solvers. It relies on formal proofs to justify code rewrites, ensuring that any self-modification is provably beneficial. However, in practice and without restrictive assumptions about the system, it is impossible to formally prove whether modification to an AI system will be beneficial. For example, while it may seem that an LLM-based coding agent would benefit from access to more tools (e.g., code search, test runners), the actual impact depends heavily on the models training and task context (e.g., testing tool that is optimized for one setup may confuse the agent when working with others). Instead of requiring formal proofs, we empirically validate self-modifications against benchmark, allowing the system to improve and explore based on observed results. This approach mirrors biological evolution, where mutations and adaptations are not verified in advance but are produced, trialed, and then selected via natural selection. We also take inspiration from Darwinian evolution [25] and investigate the effectiveness of maintaining library of previously discovered agents to serve as stepping stones for future generations. We propose the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM), self-referential, self-improving system that writes and modifies its own code to become better coding agent. Each self-modification requires the DGM to edit its own codebase. We use Python, which is Turing-complete, giving the DGM the potential to build any computable machine. Our framework envisions agents that can rewrite their own training scripts (including training new foundation model (FM)). However, we do not show that in this paper, as training FMs is computationally intensive and would introduce substantial additional complexity, which we leave as future work. Instead, this paper focuses on improving the design of coding agents with frozen pretrained FMs (e.g., tool use, workflows). The DGM alternates between self-modification and evaluation phases. During the self-modification phase, selected coding agents from the archive generate modified versions of themselves. During the evaluation phase, each modified agent is tested on coding benchmark, estimating the agents coding capabilities, and then added to the archive. By improving its own capabilities through this loop, the DGM becomes better at both solving coding tasks and making future self-improvements. key assumption is that an increase in performance on coding benchmarks indicates better coding capabilities, and hence better ability to self-modify and self-improve. Furthermore, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding agents, initialized with only one agent, and continuously accumulates all generated variants over time. To support continual self-improvement, the DGM draws inspiration from open-endedness research [35, 36, 134], accumulating diverse stepping stones (i.e., interesting yet suboptimal solutions or features that may enable future breakthroughs). This open-ended exploration encourages the discovery of novel and potentially useful self-modifications beyond immediate performance gains. 2 We present results on two coding benchmarks: SWE-bench [60] and Polyglot [104]. The DGM automatically improves itself from 20.0% to 50.0% on SWE-bench, and from 14.2% to 30.7% on Polyglot. We show that self-improvement enables continued progress, as the DGM outperforms the baseline where the same initial agent is repeatedly used to modify and generate new agents without self-improvement. We also show that open-ended exploration and keeping an archive of all previously generated agents lead to the discovery of better coding agents. The DGM outperforms the baseline of not having open-ended exploration (i.e., baseline without the accumulation of an archive of interestingly different stepping stones), where the coding agent always builds off the most recent version of itself. Overall, the DGM represents step toward AI systems that can build upon their own prior innovations and improve recursively. We consider and discuss safety aspects extensively, including sandboxing and traceability of self-modifications, to ensure responsible experimentation (Section 5). By advancing the possibility of safe, self-referential, self-improving models, the DGM moves us closer to AI that not only learns but evolves in an open-ended, self-accelerating trajectory, much like science itself."

            "content": "Open-Endedness. grand challenge for driving unbounded innovation is designing open-ended AI systems that continuously generate novel and learnable artifacts [126]. Building on this, Hughes et al. [56] characterized open-endedness as systems capacity to generate sequences of artifacts that are both novel and learnable from an observers perspective. central difficulty lies in structuring and exploring vast search spaces to consistently produce artifacts that are interesting to humans [20, 59]. Early efforts addressed this through quality-diversity algorithms [17, 90, 94, 105], goal-directed exploration methods [2, 30, 32, 33, 113], intrinsic motivation [72, 75, 100, 103], or learning progress frameworks [9, 21, 23, 27, 40, 58, 61, 117, 118]. More recently, large-scale foundation models (FMs) [14, 106] have emerged as powerful proxies for human notions of interestingness [35, 112, 148] and effective mutation operators to propose novel solutions in code [35, 53, 73, 97, 108]. FMs can guide autotelic agents [2224], model human preferences for quality and diversity [13, 29, 47, 66, 67, 78, 111, 133], design reward functions [35, 85, 132], create simulated environments [1, 15, 92, 93, 102, 129], drive ever-evolving multi-agent dynamics [28, 153], search diverse ambulating robot morphologies [73], and search expansive solution spaces for benchmark or objective optimization [35, 36, 53, 62, 69, 79, 8284, 97, 108, 148]. However, these approaches have yet to close the selfimprovement loop, meaning improvements on downstream tasks do not translate into enhanced capabilities for self-modification or the acceleration of further innovations. We aim to mimic the acceleration of science and technology, where new tools and discoveries catalyze the creation of even more discoveries. Similarly, how can we emulate natures arc of evolution, which bends not only toward complexity but also an ever greater capacity to evolve [26, 41, 49]? Meta-Learning FM Agents. Many FM-based agents are handcrafted. Some building blocks include prompt engineering [18, 119], chain-of-thought [45, 52, 77, 91, 136, 138, 144], self-reflection [86, 121, 138], multi-agent debate [62, 76], memory [80, 89, 152], temperature sampling [155], and retrieval augmented generation [74]. The manual composition of these components limits the systems abilities to the ingenuity of its human designer. More recently, several meta-learning approaches have emerged that leverage FM to automatically optimize prompts [19, 34, 36, 63, 141, 143] and design agentic modules [38, 95, 96, 109, 128, 139, 140, 147, 149, 150, 154, 156]. The Automated Design of Agentic Systems [ADAS, 53] iteratively generates downstream agents with fixed metaagent, evaluates them against target benchmark, and incorporates feedback to refine subsequent generations. In contrast, the DGM is single system that both solves downstream tasks (i.e., coding problems) and refines its own implementation (i.e., its codebase), removing the need for fixed, handcrafted meta-agent and enabling self-referential improvements. Self-Improving AI. Early on, various researchers outlined theoretical and conceptual approaches to self-improvement [42, 115, 116]. Some practical approaches to automated self-improvement include systems defined by neural network weight parameterizations [46, 48, 50, 65, 81]. Metz et al. [88] developed gradient-based optimizer that is self-referentially meta-trained using variant of population-based training [57]. Lange et al. [68] extended this approach to gradient-free learning. Silver et al. [122] used self-play to continuously evolve agents, achieving superhuman performance in challenging domains such as chess and Go. More closely related to the DGM are recent approaches that leverage FM-based agents for self-improvement [54, 55, 107, 123, 140, 145]. Zelikman et al. 3 [145] use meta-agent to generate downstream agents, updating the meta-agent based on the metautility derived from the generated solutions. Yin et al. [140] use single system to both solve downstream tasks and recursively modify itself. However, the downstream tasks or the meta-utility do not always align with the capabilities required for self-improvement. In the DGM, improvement in downstream tasks directly reflects an increase in self-improvement ability, enabling the potential for self-accelerating progress. Most similar is concurrent work by Robeyns et al. [107], which also has single agent recursively solving coding problems and modifying its own codebase. The main difference between the DGM and Robeyns et al. [107] is that the DGM has an open-ended exploration loop, encouraging self-modifications beyond immediate performance gains and thus avoiding stagnation in suboptimal self-modifications."

            "content": "A Gödel Machine is theoretical idea of an AI that searches for ways that provably improve itself [116]. In this paper, we propose Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM), an attempt to realize the long-held dream of creating Gödel Machine. The DGM relaxes the Gödel Machines impractical requirement of theoretically proving that change will improve the system, instead requiring empirical evidence from experiments to demonstrate that proposed new version enhances performance. Additionally, since the DGM relies on empirical evidence of improvement, it may get stuck in local optimum within the vast search space of possible systems (i.e., all computable algorithms). To address this, the DGM maintains an archive of discovered solutions during the search, facilitating open-ended exploration rather than relying on evolving single solution. Since the principles echo Darwinian evolution [25], where new innovations emerge by selecting an entity from an archive of previously discovered solutions, modifying it, and keeping it if it is interestingly new [35, 125, 148], we call our algorithm Darwin Gödel Machine. Self-referential Self-improvement of Coding Agents. The DGM is initialized with only one coding agent, and its progression is evaluated on coding benchmarks. coding agent is defined as single system, implemented with code repository and powered by frozen pretrained foundation models (FMs), capable of reading, writing, and executing code. Recent works [53, 149] demonstrate that such agents can be improved through meta-learning of their designs (e.g., prompts, workflows, and tools), which are implemented in their code repository. Therefore, we define self-improvement as coding task that involves modifying the design of an agents own components (i.e., its own code). The key motivation is that the empirical evidence must reflect the systems ability to both self-improve and solve downstream tasks. By configuring the DGM as coding agent and testing its coding capabilities, the observed improvements demonstrate not only enhanced performance in downstream tasks but also the capacity for further self-improvement, as self-improvement is fundamentally coding task that modifies the coding agents own code repository. Population-based Open-ended Exploration. Starting from single initial coding agent, the DGM builds an archive of all discovered agents. In each iteration, the DGM selects parent agents to selfmodify and branch off to produce new agents. Parent selection is roughly proportional to each agents performance score and the number of its children with codebase-editing functionality (Appendix A.2). Each selected parent analyzes its own benchmark evaluation logs, proposes the next feature to implement, and receives this proposal as problem statement to execute (Appendix A.3). The parent then implements the suggested feature into its own codebase, generating new coding agent. Each newly generated agent is quantitatively evaluated on chosen coding benchmark to estimate its coding abilities. Only agents that compile successfully and retain the ability to edit given codebase are added to the DGM archive, as only they can continue self-modification. All others are discarded. The cycle of parent selection, self-modification, and evaluation continues, progressively growing the archive of solutions. Importantly, we note that archived solutions can serve as stepping stones that result in improvements much later than their original discovery, making our approach substantially different from hill-climbing agentic design approaches [107]. Currently, the open-ended exploration process (i.e., archive maintenance, parent selection) is fixed and not modifiable by the DGM, which we leave as an avenue for future work. Appendix A.4 shows the pseudocode for the DGM algorithm."

Across all experiments, we find that the DGM outperforms both baselines, showing that the self-improvement mechanism and open-ended exploration are essential for sustained performance gains (Section 4.4).

We run the DGM for 80 iterations (generating one new agent per iteration), with two iterations running in parallel for SWE-bench and four for Polyglot (Appendix A.2).

            "title": "4.2 Benchmarks",
            "content": "Both SWE-bench and Polyglot are benchmarks that evaluate how well AI agents solve coding tasks automatically. Given code repository and task instruction, the agent is expected to make changes to the repository in order to fulfill the task. Both SWE-bench and Polyglot are widely used benchmarks [16, 39, 43, 137, 146, 151] that require the AI agent to navigate code repository, understand the interplay between functions in different files, and spot small errors in convoluted code. SWE-bench only has Python tasks, while Polyglot has tasks in multiple programming languages. Another difference is that each SWE-bench task may require edits to multiple files, whereas each Polyglot task primarily involves implementing solution from scratch in single file (although the agent still needs to examine other files to understand what changes are necessary), resulting in fewer file edits overall. We evaluate the DGM on two popular benchmarks that assess different aspects of coding tasks to validate the algorithms effectiveness across various use cases. SWE-bench. To avoid wasting compute on unsolvable tasks, we use SWE-bench Verified [98], subset of SWE-bench [60] filtered by human annotators to ensure that every task is solvable. Throughout this paper, the term SWE-bench refers by default to the SWE-bench Verified subset. Polyglot. Polyglot includes tasks in multiple programming languages (C++, Rust, Python, etc.) [104]. Compared to SWE-bench, one of the most widely used coding benchmarks and likely included in the training sets of FMs, Polyglot is more niche and less likely to be included in FMs post-training data. Additionally, Polyglot is primarily used for evaluating Aider [39] by its developer. This provides an opportunity to compare automatically designed agents with representative coding agent in the community, which has been continuously developed and tested against the Polyglot benchmark over year by human developers. Finally, Polyglot enables testing of the DGMs ability to generalize across multiple programming languages beyond just Python. We adopt similar setup to the Polyglot leaderboard [104], with one key difference: the leaderboard reports pass@2 performance, where the agent can view feedback from ground-truth tests once. In contrast, we use pass@1 setting, where the agent never sees the results of ground-truth tests. Since it is expensive to evaluate on the full benchmarks (Appendix B.1), we use staged evaluation strategy to estimate the coding agents performance. In general, we evaluate the coding agent on more tasks when we are more confident that it is relatively strong performer. We first evaluate each coding agent on set of 10 tasks to verify basic codebase-editing functionality. Only agents that retain the ability to edit code can solve downstream coding tasks or perform further self-modifications. Agents that pass this initial stage are then evaluated on an expanded set of 50 tasks. For SWE-bench, tasks are selected based on SWE-bench-verified-mini [50], which is designed to be representative sample of the full benchmark (Appendix B.2). For Polyglot, tasks are chosen as random subset of the full benchmark (Appendix B.3). Because the LLMs we use are inherently stochastic, performance can be noisy. We use smaller subset evaluations to estimate general effectiveness and identify top candidates. 5 For SWE-bench, if coding agent achieves over 40% success (a heuristic chosen based on the noise observed in preliminary runs) on the 60-task subset and ranks among the top two performers in the archive, it is then evaluated on 200 tasks (140 plus the previous 60) to more accurately assess its true coding capability (Appendix B.2). For Polyglot, if coding agent achieves over 40% success on the 10-task subset, it is evaluated on an expanded 50-task subset (Appendix B.3)."

            "content": "To isolate and evaluate the contribution of the DGMs core components, we compare the DGM against two baselines: DGM without self-improvement (DGM w/o self-improve) and DGM without open-ended exploration (DGM w/o open-ended exploration). DGM w/o self-improve replicates the approach of ADAS [53] in this setting, wherein the meta agent responsible for modifying the coding agents remains fixed as the initial agent throughout the experiment. This baseline allows us to assess the role of iterative self-improvement in accelerating the evolution of better coding agents. DGM w/o open-ended exploration eliminates the use of an archive and always self-modifies the latest stored version of itself. If coding agent self-modifies to the point where it loses the basic functionality required to edit codebase, it can no longer modify itself or solve any coding task. Therefore, DGM w/o open-ended exploration retains the latest version of itself that still maintains the basic functionality for codebase editing. This baseline allows us to evaluate the impact of having an archive and the well-documented beneficial principles of open-ended exploration [20, 23, 36, 70, 111, 125, 148] in guiding the agents evolution. In addition to the learned baselines, we compare the DGM against handcrafted, open-source solutions. For SWE-bench, we take the state-of-the-art (SoTA) open-source solution that has been checked (i.e., the SWE-bench team was able to reproduce the results) (Appendix B.4). For Polyglot, we take the representative agent (Aider) [39], which is open-sourced and designed to support multiple programming languages and large codebase editing (Appendix B.5). For fair comparison, we measure the percentage of solved tasks on the same benchmark subsets used to evaluate the DGM (Appendix B.2, Appendix B.3). These values are shown as dotted horizontal lines in Figure 2."

The DGM automatically discovers increasingly better coding agents and performs better on both (Left) SWE-bench and (Right) Polyglot. It outperforms baselines that lack either self-improvement or open-ended exploration, showing that both components are essential for continual self-improvement. These scores are obtained from evaluating on the benchmark subsets detailed in Section 4.2. After 80 iterations of the DGM, the coding agents performance increases from 20.0% to 50.0% on SWE-bench, and from 14.0% to 38.0% on Polyglot (Figure 2). Since the DGM is evaluated on only 50 tasks in the Polyglot experiment setup (Section 4.2), we additionally evaluate both the initial agent and the best DGM-discovered agent on the full Polyglot benchmark to more accurately estimate the improvement. On the full Polyglot benchmark, the DGM improves the coding agent from 14.2% to 30.7%. This shows that the DGM can automatically self-improve to create better coding agent. Moreover, the performance of the best DGM-discovered agent is comparable to that of 6 Figure 3: The DGM automatically self-improves to become better coding agent. (Left) Archive of coding agents generated during the DGM run on SWE-bench. Each node represents coding agent, with node 0 corresponding to the initial agent. Node color indicates performance on SWE-bench (percentage of solved tasks), while border color reflects the number of tasks for which the agent was evaluated. Edges show which agents self-modified to produce the offsprings. Many paths to innovation traverse lower-performing nodes, and key innovations (like node 24) lead to an explosion of innovations built on top of them. Both properties underscore the benefits of open-ended search. (Right) Progress plot of the DGM on SWE-bench. The light blue line shows the average score of all agents possessing basic codebase-editing functionality. The blue line tracks the best score achieved by any agent in the archive at each iteration. The dark line shows the lineage of the final best-discovered agent and its precursor nodes, which includes two performance dips. This illustrates the benefits of open-ended search, which explores diverse set of interesting stepping stones instead of focusing only on branching off the best solution found so far. the checked, open-source, human-designed SoTA on SWE-bench (Figure 2). On Polyglot, although the DGM starts with an initial agent whose performance is lower than that of Aider, it discovers an agent that far surpasses Aider (Figure 2). The DGM-discovered agents are comparable to or outperform handcrafted agents on both benchmarks. While the SoTA SWE-bench agent and Aider were painstakingly shaped by human efforts, the DGM hints at future in which such ingenuity is automated, evolving through self-referential cycles of continuous self-improvements. The DGM automatically improves both the tools and the workflow of how FMs are utilized (Figure 3). For example, the DGM enhanced the edit tool to allow more granular file viewing (by lines) and more precise file editing (by string replacement), instead of always viewing or replacing the entire file. Workflow improvements include making multiple attempts to solve task and using another FM to evaluate and select the best solution. Other workflow improvements include considering previous attempts when generating subsequent ones. Appendix C.1 and Appendix C.2 show all modifications leading up to the final best-discovered agents on SWE-bench and Polyglot respectively. Because open-ended exploration allows branching from any agent in the archive with non-zero probability, the DGM can get out of deceptive dips or peaks in performance. For example, at iterations 4 and 56 of the experiment on SWE-bench, although the agents score temporarily fell below that of its parent, the DGM was still able to explore innovations along that path and create new agent that outperformed all of its predecessors (Figure 3). Furthermore, open-ended exploration allows different implementations of the same target functionality to be attempted. For example, while the goal is to provide finer-grained editing tools, the specific implementation of this feature can vary greatly and hence lead to very different performance (Appendix D). The DGM can explore multiple implementations to find the most suitable one and avoid getting trapped in suboptimal one. The DGM outperforms the baselines of DGM w/o self-improve and DGM w/o open-ended exploration on both benchmarks (Figure 2). Without updating the meta agent that modifies coding agents, DGM w/o self-improve improves the agents in early iterations, but its gains taper off quickly (Appendix E.1). In DGM w/o open-ended exploration, only the most recent agent is retained, so poorly performing self-modification makes subsequent improvements harder to achieve (Appendix E.1). To evaluate the generality of the improvements from the DGM, we tested the initial agent (Section 4.1) and the best agent discovered during the DGM run (Figure 2) with different FMs than those used 7 Figure 4: Transfer between Models and Tasks. (Left and Middle) The superior performance of DGM-discovered agents can be transferred across different models and (Right) different task domains, such as from Python tasks to tasks in other languages like Rust, C++, Go, and others. during optimization. For SWE-bench, where the DGM was run using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New), we replaced the FM with Claude 3.7 Sonnet [5] or o3-mini, and evaluated on 200 tasks (Figure 4, Left). With o3-mini, the initial agent achieved 23.0% and the DGM-discovered agent 33.0%. With Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the initial agent achieved 19.0% and the DGM-discovered agent 59.5%. For Polyglot, where the DGM was run with o3-mini, we replaced the FM with Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) or Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and evaluated on the full benchmark (Figure 4, Middle). With Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New), the initial agent achieved 32.0% and the DGM-discovered agent 33.3%. With Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the initial agent achieved 35.6% and the DGM-discovered agent 36.8%. These results suggest that the DGM yields improvements that generalize across FMs, rather than being tightly coupled to the specific FM used during its run (Figure 4). Furthermore, to evaluate the transferability of the DGM-discovered agent across programming languages, we experiment with version of the DGM trained exclusively on Python tasks from Polyglot and then transfer the discovered agent to tasks in other languages. Focusing primarily on Python tasks slightly improves performance on Python tasks but reduces performance on non-Python tasks compared to the DGM trained on all languages (Figure 4, Right). However, after being transferred from Python to other unseen languages during the search, the agent still achieves performance comparable to that of the DGM trained on all languages and substantially outperforms both the initial agent and Aider. These results demonstrate the robustness of the discovered improvements, showing that they do not overfit to specific programming language."

            "title": "5 Safety Discussion",
            "content": "Systems capable of self-improvement, such as the DGM, represent step toward more autonomous AI development, aligning with long-standing goals in the field of making capable AI that can benefit humanity [20, 71, 87, 115]. However, this capability introduces unique safety considerations stemming from the systems ability to autonomously modify its own code. Modifications optimized solely for benchmark performance might inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities or behaviors misaligned with human intentions, even if they improve the target metric [12]. In particular, if evaluation benchmarks do not fully capture all desired agent properties (e.g., safety and robustness), the self-improvement loop could amplify misalignment over successive generations. Iterative self-modification could also lead to increasingly complex and uninterpretable internal logic, hindering human understanding, oversight, and control [6, 37, 44, 120]. Recognizing these challenges, the current implementation and experimental setup of the DGM incorporates several safeguards. All agent execution and self-modification processes are conducted within isolated sandboxed environments, limiting their ability to affect the host system, and thereby mitigating the risk of unintended actions. Each execution within the sandbox is subjected to strict time limit, reducing the risk of resource exhaustion or unbounded behavior. The self-improvement process is currently confined to the well-defined domain of enhancing performance on specific coding benchmarks by modifying the agents own Python codebase, thus limiting the scope of potential modifications. Additionally, we actively monitor agent performance and code changes, with the DGM archive providing traceable lineage of modifications for review. At this stage, we have found 8 no evidence of harmful or malicious behavior in the generated agents, and the self-modifications have been primarily focused on improving coding capabilities. Conversely, significant potential benefit of the self-improvement paradigm is that it could, in principle, be directed toward enhancing safety and interpretability themselves. We conduct preliminary investigation into how the DGM can be deployed in AI safety settings to develop countermeasures for FM hallucination (Appendix F). Just as the DGM learns to improve its coding capabilities, it could potentially discover and integrate better internal safeguards or modify itself for greater transparency (e.g., incorporating principles akin to Constitutional AI [8]), if such properties were included in its evaluation criteria [109]. This suggests promising, albeit challenging, pathway in which selfimprovement becomes tool for building more trustworthy AI systems. Additional research could also explore weaving Constitutional AI in from the start, though the challenge would be incentivizing the system to retain these directives (an option worth exploring is to create an unmodifiable part of the system to be able to evaluate at halt the rest). The DGM demonstrates the potential of self-improving AI while still operating within safe research boundaries due to the current limitations of frontier FMs and effective mitigations like sandboxing. We include this safety discussion proactively to raise awareness about the emerging prospect of selfimproving AI systems and their associated safety implications, particularly as these systems inevitably become more capable [10, 11, 20, 31, 142]. Accordingly, we advocate for continued investigation into the safe and beneficial evolution of AI-Generating Algorithms [20] and self-improving systems."

            "title": "6 Conclusion and Limitations",
            "content": "We introduce the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM), the first self-improving system powered by FMs with open-ended exploration, where progress on its evaluation benchmarks can directly translate into better self-improvement capabilities. We demonstrate the automatic discovery of better tools and FM systems, resulting in better performance on two benchmarks: SWE-bench and Polyglot. Through self-improvement and open-ended exploration, the DGM shows continuous increase in performance, bringing us one step closer to self-accelerating, self-improving AI systems. We demonstrate that the DGM can autonomously achieve performance on par with openly available solutions. However, it still falls short of closed-source SoTA SWE-bench solutions. An open question is whether running the DGM for longer would continue to yield performance gains and eventually surpass closed-source solutions. These closed-source solutions often rely on elaborately handcrafted techniques developed by teams of highly skilled experts. Since FMs have yet to match the capabilities of such experts (e.g., in reasoning), the DGM currently requires extensive compute to discover improvements. single run of the DGM on SWE-bench, as presented in Section 4, takes about 2 weeks and incurs significant API costs (Appendix B.1). We hypothesize that further progress will require more efficient use of computational resources and the development of better reasoning skills. Since this version of the DGM is mainly powered by FMs, it is inherently limited by the capabilities of the underlying FM. Hence, an exciting future direction is to extend self-modification beyond just prompts or FM workflows, to include more computationally intensive methods, such as rewriting its own training script to update the FM itself. While this version of the DGM focuses on coding, AI systems are increasingly applied across wide range of domains (e.g., computer vision, creative writing). Another promising extension is to develop self-improving AI systems capable of enhancing themselves beyond just the coding domain. key assumption in this work is that coding benchmarks are good reflection of the agents ability to self-improve, since the self-modification task requires the agent to modify its own codebase. However, one could envision an alternative approach that co-evolves the target task distribution, thereby removing the constraint of self-improvement being tied to single objective, as in true open-ended processes. As discussed in Section 5, we must also continue to keep safety front and center as we explore this powerful technology. In conclusion, the DGM represents significant step toward the automation of AI development through self-improving systems capable of editing their own codebase. While current limitations in compute and reasoning constrain its full potential, continued advances in FMs and infrastructure may unlock more powerful and general-purpose self-improvements. Provided that the safety concerns are carefully navigated (Section 5), the future of self-improving AI systems and AI-Generating Algorithms [20] holds immense promise to open-endedly evolve AI, continually rewriting or retraining itself in pursuit of greater capabilities aligned with human values."

A.2 Parent Selection At each DGM iteration, we select subset of agents from the archive as parents to self-modify and produce new child agents (Section 3). The details of the parent selection process are outlined below. At each iteration of the DGM run, let At = {at 1, at 2, . . . , at } be the archive of candidate agents. We first define the eligible set At : αi < 1(cid:9), = (cid:8) at i.e. only those agents whose performance score is not yet perfect. We then sample parents (with replacement) from in proportion to combined measure of performance and number of children with codebase-editing functionality. Concretely, for each agent at t: (performance) αi = performance(at i), (children count) ni = functioning_children_count(at i), (sigmoid-scaled performance) si = 1 1 + exp(cid:0)λ (αi α0)(cid:1) , (novelty bonus) hi = 1 1 + ni , (unnormalized weight) wi = si hi, wi j=1 wj (selection probability) pi = (cid:80)N , (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (sampling) { parents } Categorical(cid:0){pi}at iE (cid:1) (draw samples). (7) Here, λ > 0 controls the sharpness of the sigmoid, and α0 is the midpoint accuracy. We set λ = 10 and α0 = 0.5. determines how many self-improvements are done in parallel during each iteration of the DGM run. We set = 2 in SWE-bench experiments, and = 4 in Polyglot experiments. This parent selection favors agents with high performance and fewer existing children, thereby promoting both exploitation and exploration in the open-ended process. All agents in the archive maintain non-zero probability of being sampled, meaning that any path to improvement is feasible given sufficient compute. A.3 Self-Improve Prompts For chosen coding agent to self-modify, we feed the evaluation logs from its performance on the coding benchmark into an FM to diagnose the next potential improvement (Section 3). We chose to use OpenAIs o1 model [130] for this purpose, as we found it had better reasoning capabilities than other FMs available at the time of our experiments. The prompts used for this diagnosis are provided below. From the diagnostic output, the implementation_suggestion and problem_description are extracted and passed to the coding agent as its self-modification task. Self-improve diagnosis prompt for SWE-bench experiments: Self-Improve Prompt # Coding Agent Summary - **Main File**: `coding_agent.py` - Primary Class: `AgenticSystem` - The `forward()` function is the central entry point. - Prompts are located either within the `forward()` function or in the `prompts/` directory. - **Tools**: `tools/` - The `tools/` directory contains various tools that LLMs can use to perform specific tasks. - Each tool must have `tool_info()` function that returns JSON object containing 'name', 'description', and 'input_schema'. The 'input_schema' should be JSON object containing (cid:44) 'type', 'properties', and 'required'.

However, more complex and niche tools may require explicit instructions in the prompt. - The agent is very good at automatically utilizing the right available tools at the right time. (cid:44) - Common tools, such as file editing and bash commands, are easy for the agent to recognize and (cid:44) (cid:44) - Tools should be designed to be as general as possible, ensuring they work across any GitHub repository.

At the time of writing this paper (16 April 2025), the highest performing, checked (i.e., the SWE-bench team received access to the system and were able to reproduce the patch generations), open-source entry on SWE-bench Verified is OpenHands + CodeAct v2.1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) [135], achieving 53.0%. Only considering the same subset of 200 tasks used by the DGM (Appendix B.2), OpenHands + CodeAct v2.1 (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) achieves 51.0%. B.5 Polyglot Representative Agent Aider [39], popular coding agent in the community, was published in Spring 2024. It has garnered over 33,000 stars on GitHub and has been continuously developed and tested against the Polyglot benchmark for over year by human developers, primarily to evaluate its performance. Aider has also become standard baseline for assessing the performance of different models, with the current top performers on the Polyglot benchmark being mix of o3 (high) and GPT-4.1. We adopt setup similar to that of the Polyglot leaderboard, with one key difference: the leaderboard reports pass@2 performance, where the agent can view feedback from ground-truth tests once. In contrast, we use pass@1 setting, where the agent never sees the results of ground-truth tests, as we believe this more closely reflects realistic coding applications.

For example, consider nodes 6 and 24 in the DGM run on SWE-bench (Figure 3). Both aimed to enhance the existing editor tool to support finer-grained file editing. However, the implementation for node 6 retained the original edit command and added the parameters edit_type and edit_actions, whereas the implementation for node 24 replaced the original edit command with new str_replace command. Despite targeting similar functionality, the feature suggestions and thus the implementation details differed greatly, as did their performance. Node 6 achieved only 23.3%, while node 24 achieved 40.5%. Feature suggestion to obtain node 6: Within the tools/edit.py file, remove the 'edit' command and introduce 'str_replace' command. It (cid:44) should accept parameters 'old_str' (the unique text to find) and 'new_str' (the new text to (cid:44) replace it with). After verifying that 'old_str' appears exactly once in the file, replace (cid:44) the first occurrence with 'new_str'. If 'old_str' is not unique or is missing, do not write (cid:44) any changes. Replace the 'edit' command in the editor tool with 'str_replace' command that locates and replaces (cid:44) an exact substring in file. The 'old_str' must match consecutive lines uniquely, and if it (cid:44) is not found or occurs multiple times, no write should occur. The 'new_str' parameter (cid:44) contains the revised lines. This precise substring replacement flow will enable small (cid:44) incremental edits with minimal breakage. Feature suggestion to obtain node 24: Augment the existing 'editor' tool to support line or token-based editing. The agent would specify (cid:44) individual lines or tokens to insert, delete, or replace. Internally, the tool would parse (cid:44) the file contents, apply changes atomically, and verify that the surrounding context remains (cid:44) intact. This prevents entire-file overwrites, reducing the risk of losing unrelated logic. 51 (cid:44) The tool could also validate that the edited lines match expected code fragments to catch (cid:44) unanticipated differences or merge conflicts. Enhance the agent's file editing process to support fine-grained edits. Specifically, add (cid:44) line-based or token-based editing feature in the 'editor' tool. This improvement should let (cid:44) the agent insert, replace, or delete small sections of code without overwriting entire files (cid:44) or large blocks, preserving unrelated logic. Implement safeguards to confirm that contextual (cid:44) code around the edited region remains accurate, so we reduce the risk of creating regressions (cid:44) when fixing issues.

In this section, we show that the DGM can address hallucinations of tool use by FMs. Through feedback from evaluation logs, the DGM improves hallucination detection mechanisms and ultimately discovers ways to resolve these hallucinations. We provide more detailed discussion of when these hallucinations occur, the DGM setup, and the resulting solutions. Finally, we present an example of objective hacking, where the agent optimizes for the quantifiable metric rather than truly fulfilling the spirit of the task and solving the underlying problem.

Node color indicates solved hallucination score, while border color reflects whether the agent has basic codebase-editing functionality. Edges show which agents self-modified to produce the offsprings. When hallucination occurs. When the input context to Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) (Claude) is very long, including all previous tool use inputs and outputs, we found that Claude tends to hallucinate tool usage. Instead of actually making tool call, it outputs the tool input and output as plain text. This is an example of Claude hallucinating tool use, claiming that the Bash tool was used to run tests and that the tool output suggests that all tests passed, but Claude did not invoke any tools, and the tool results were entirely hallucinated in plain text: I'll run the tests as specified in the <test_description>.

The problem (cid:44) described in <problem_description> has been successfully fixed and verified through the test (cid:44) suite. DGM setup. We run this experiment on SWE-bench. Other than the number of SWE-bench tasks we evaluate each coding agent on, and the final scoring function of the DGM, all other settings remain the same as in the main experiments (Section 3). The initial coding agent and all agents generated during the DGM run are evaluated on only 3 SWE-bench tasks. We use just 3 tasks because if hallucination occurs in one, it is likely to occur in others as well. Hence, 3 tasks are sufficient to provide the DGM with reliable signal regarding whether tool use hallucination is still present. Solve hallucination score. We score each generated agent based on how effectively it presents hallucinations. For each SWE-bench task the agent is evaluated on, the score has two components: 0 - 1 based on whether hallucination occurred in the logs, and 1 - 2 (only added and accounted for after no hallucination occurs in the logs) if tools were used in all Claude calls. The final solve hallucination score is computed as the average across all evaluated tasks. To detect hallucination in the logs, we insert special tokens when actual tool use occurs and then check if these tokens appear in the models plain-text output, indicating that the model mimicked tool use without actually invoking any tools. Importantly, the hallucination checking functions are hidden from the coding agent during self-modification. We found that objective hacking (i.e., optimizing for the measurable objective instead of truly solving the underlying problem) occurs more frequently when these functions are not hidden. Results. We run the DGM for 150 iterations. In this run, the DGM discovers two promising solutions: node 96, which achieves the second highest score of 1.67, and node 114, which achieves perfect score of 2.0 (Figure 7). Node 96 addresses hallucination to some extent, achieving score of 1.67 without objective hacking. In the lineage leading to node 96, the DGM first improves the tool transaction logging mechanisms to better detect when hallucination occurs. It then explores various strategies to solve it, such as removing hallucinated tool use from the output text when it determines that the tool was not actually invoked. Node 114 achieves perfect score quickly, after only 2 modifications in its lineage. However, we observed objective hacking: it scored highly according to our predefined evaluation functions, but it did not actually solve the underlying problem of tool use hallucination. In the modification leading up to node 114 (see below), the agent removed the logging of special tokens that indicate tool usage (despite instructions not to change the special tokens), effectively bypassing our hallucination detection function. diff --git a/coding_agent.py b/coding_agent.py index 620da2f..800b06e 100644 --- a/coding_agent.py +++ b/coding_agent.py @@ -196,13 +196,16 @@ def chat_with_claude(task, chat_history, user_instr): \"input\": tool_input }) - # Process the tool call + # Process the tool call and record in structured format tool_result = process_tool_call(tools_dict, tool_name, tool_input) - output_ls.extend([ - {TOOL_USED_MARKER: tool_name}, - {TOOL_INPUT_MARKER: tool_input}, - {TOOL_RESULT_MARKER: tool_result} - ]) + # Use structured format instead of text markers + output_ls.append({ + \"tool_invocation\": { + \"name\": tool_name, + \"input\": tool_input, + \"result\": tool_result + } + }) # Continue with tool results messages.extend([ @@ -224,7 +227,13 @@ def chat_with_claude(task, chat_history, user_instr): tools=tools, ) tool_response_text = next((block.text for block in tool_response.content if hasattr(block, (cid:44) \"text\")), None) - output_ls.append({TOOL_RESPONSE_MARKER: tool_response_text}) + # Record tool response in structured format 63 + if tool_response_text: + output_ls.append({ + \"tool_response\": { + \"content\": tool_response_text + } + }) response = tool_response # Validate tool response In conclusion, the DGM can be applied beyond the coding domain, and we highlighted case of objective hacking. Similar to reward hacking in reinforcement learning [124], objective hacking occurs when system optimizes for predefined, quantifiable objective rather than fulfilling the spirit of the task or solving the intended problem. This observation supports arguments made in prior works [35, 148], which suggest that optimizing quantitative measures often leads to undesirable or pathological outcomes, and aligns with Goodharts law [127] \"When measure becomes target, it ceases to be good measure.\""
