            "content": "The escalating global demand for mental health services has starkly outpaced the availability of trained human therapists, creating critical gap in care (Hua et al., 2025; Na et al., 2025a). In response, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising frontier for delivering *Equal Contribution. Corresponding Authors. 1 Figure 1: Illustration of Our TheraMind Framework. scalable, accessible, and immediate psychological support (Qiu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023a; Lee et al., 2024). Early explorations have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to generate empathetic and contextually relevant responses, establishing foundational capability for automated counseling systems (Zhang et al., 2024c; Weizenbaum, 1983). These initial successes have catalyzed wave of research aimed at transforming conversational AI from simple chatbots into effective therapeutic partners (Qiu and Lan, 2025; Xie et al., 2025). Despite these advancements, current LLMbased counseling agents, such as ChatCounselor and PsyLLM (Liu et al., 2023a; Hu et al., 2025a), operate under paradigm that fundamentally misaligns with the principles of genuine psychotherapy. These systems are predominantly architected for single-session contexts, exhibiting form of clinical amnesia that prevents them from building upon past interactions. As illustrated in Figure 1, they lack the crucial ability to perform crosssession memory retrieval, deficit that erodes the therapeutic alliance and hinders long-term progress. Furthermore, they suffer from strategic rigidity; most are hard-coded with single therapeutic modality (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and cannot flexibly adjust treatment methods across sessions in response to patients evolving needs (Moggia et al., 2024; Comai et al., 2025; Zarbo et al., 2016). This lack of longitudinal memory and strategic adaptability reduces the complex therapeutic process to disjointed, tactical exchanges, failing to provide the continuous followup that is the hallmark of effective care. To bridge this critical gap between reactive dialogue and strategic therapy, we introduce TheraMind, strategic and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. As illustrated in Figure 1, the cornerstone of TheraMind is novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management and CrossSession Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. Within single session, the Intra-Session Loop moves beyond generating simple empathetic responses. It employs Reaction Classifier to perceive the patients emotional state and attitude, which in turn informs the dynamic selection of response strategy, such as Supportive or Challenging approach, while continuously tracking the current treatment stage. Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term strategic capabilities. By analyzing the dialogue history after each session, TheraMind evaluates therapeutic efficacy and adaptively selects or adjusts the treatment method for subsequent interactions, ensuring the entire counseling arc is coherent, personalized, and goal-oriented. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments within high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical cases. Our results demonstrate that TheraMind establishes new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming wide range of baselines, including specialized counseling models, general-purpose LLMs, and other agent-based systems. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in multi-session metrics such as Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, directly confirming the efficacy of our dual-loop design. Furthermore, both comprehensive ablation studies and human evaluations corroborate that TheraMinds architecture produces more clinically sound, strategically adaptive, and coherent therapeutic dialogues. This work makes definitive shift from static, single-turn models to dynamic, longitudinal agent that more closely emulates the cognitive processes of human therapist. The primary contributions of this paper are as follows: novel dual-loop agent framework (TheraMind) that effectively models both the tactical, turn-byturn dynamics and the strategic, multi-session arc of psychological counseling. An adaptive therapy selection mechanism that enables the agent to evaluate its own efficacy and adjust its core treatment method across sessions, overcoming the static, single-therapy paradigm of prior work. clinically-grounded dialogue management system that integrates patient state perception, dynamic response strategy selection, and treatment phase awareness to transform response generation into deliberative clinical intervention."

Early work like ELIZA showed that simple pattern matching could emulate therapist-like responses (Weizenbaum, 1983), inspiring subsequent NLP methods for emotion detection (Poria et al., 2019), dialogue act classification (He et al., 2021), and context-aware therapeutic response generation (Zhang et al., 2024c). Some systems embed structured techniques such as CBT (Beck, 2011; Lee et al., 2024) or motivational interviewing (Wu et al., 2022). Recent efforts adapt LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on counseling data. ChatCounselor (Liu et al., 2023a) uses the Psych8k corpus to achieve near-ChatGPT performance on counseling benchmarks. CPsyCoun (Zhang et al., 2024a) reconstructs Chinese dialogues via two-phase frame2 work and provides evaluation datasets. MentaLLaMA (Yang et al., 2024) explores instruction tuning for empathy and reasoning, while PsyLLM (Hu et al., 2025a) integrates diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning. KokoroChat (Qi et al., 2025) offers 6,589 Japanese dialogues, improving fine-tuned model performance. PsyDial (Qiu and Lan, 2025) builds longitudinal datasets via privacy-preserving RMRR, enabling long-term modeling. PsyDT (Xie et al., 2025) introduces digital twin paradigm with dynamic one-shot learning and GPT-4guided synthesis. Beyond SFT, reinforcement learning and preference optimization enhance adaptability. COMPEER (Wang et al., 2025b) applies RL for controllable empathetic reasoning, and Zhang et al. (2025) introduce PsychoCounsel-Preference, professional preference dataset for reward and policy learning. However, SFT struggles to unify diverse capabilities, while RL is sensitive to reward design (Ghosh et al., 2024; Kwon et al., 2023), leading to models that cannot fully adapt to real-world therapeutic complexity (Tran et al., 2025)."

This approach fundamentally fails to capture the longitudinal, adaptive, and strategic nature of genuine psychotherapy. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce TheraMind, an autonomous agent framework engineered to emulate the hierarchical cognitive processes of human therapist over multisession treatment arc. The cornerstone of TheraMind is novel dualloop architecture, illustrated in Figure 2. This design decouples the complex task of counseling into two distinct yet interconnected control flows: 1. The Intra-Session Loop governs tactical conversational execution, managing the nuanced, turn-by-turn dynamics within single counseling session. 2. The Cross-Session Loop directs strategic therapeutic planning, overseeing the high-level treatment trajectory and its adaptation across multiple sessions. This hierarchical decomposition enables TheraMind to maintain both immediate conversational coherence and long-term therapeutic objectives simultaneously."

Existing models, which primarily process raw text, lack this crucial layer of perception. To address this, we introduce dedicated perception module. Upon receiving patient utterance Ut, TheraMind employs Reaction Classifier to infer structured representation of the patients immediate psychological state. Formally, this perception function, Φperceive, maps an utterance to state tuple: St = (Et, It, At) = Φperceive(Ut) (1) 3 Figure 2: The TheraMind framework operates on novel dual-loop paradigm. The Intra-Session Loop (top) executes turn-byturn dialogue management, involving patient state perception, memory retrieval, and clinically-grounded response generation. The Cross-Session Loop (bottom) performs macro-level strategic planning by evaluating therapeutic efficacy after each session and adaptively selecting the therapeutic method for the next, enabling true longitudinal and personalized counseling. where Et is the primary emotion, It [0, 1] is its intensity, and At {Cooperative, Resistant} is the conversational attitude. This explicit state representation allows TheraMind to move beyond mere linguistic pattern-matching and engage with the patients underlying psychological state.

            "content": "Effective therapeutic responses are not just empathetic; they are purposeful interventions. Generation must be guided by clear clinical objectives, rather than being an unconstrained generative process. We achieve this by conditioning the LLM on explicit strategic and procedural guidance. The agents response, Rt, is generated via deliberative process that integrates multiple streams of information. This process can be formalized as sequence of steps: Dynamic Response Strategy. First, tactical response strategy σt is determined from the perceived patient state St: σt = fstrategy(St) (3) Current Therapeutic Phase. Concurrently, the current therapeutic phase Pt is identified based on the sessions overarching therapy method Tk and the dialogue history in the current session Ht1: Pt = fphase(Tk, Ht1) (4) 4 Synthesized Generation. Finally, the agents response Rt is generated by an LLM G, conditioned on the complete set of factors: Rt G(Ut, Ht1, Tk, σt, Pt, Mt) (5) This multi-factor conditioning transforms response generation from reactive task into deliberative clinical intervention. Each response is strategically aligned with the patients immediate state (St), the conversational tactic (σt), the sessions procedural stage (Pt), and the long-term therapeutic goal (Tk), ensuring every utterance is purposeful. 3.2 The Cross-Session Loop: Adaptive Therapeutic Planning This loop represents TheraMinds most significant departure from prior work, endowing the agent with the ability to reflect, learn, and adapt its core treatment strategy over time, hallmark of expert human therapists."

Without an evaluative step, any multi-session interaction would be mere sequence of conversations, not coherent therapeutic process. At the conclusion of session k, with its complete dialogue history Hk, Therapy Evaluation module assesses the efficacy of the employed therapeutic method Tk. This function yields quantitative score Ek: Ek = feval(Hk, Tk) (6) This reflective step is critical; it transforms the agent from static system into learning entity.

            "content": "Human therapy is inherently adaptive; single therapeutic modality may not be effective for all patients or for all stages of treatment. Current AI systems are rigid, typically hard-coded to single therapeutic framework (e.g., CBT). This is primary barrier to their real-world applicability. The core innovation of TheraMind resides in its ability to dynamically select the therapeutic method for the subsequent session. Instead of relying on rigid performance threshold, this decision is delegated to an LLM-based Therapy Selection module, fselect. This module performs nuanced, qualitative assessment, interpreting the quantitative efficacy score Ek in the context of the sessions dialogue history Hk to make clinical judgment. The selection process is formalized as: Tk+1 = fselect(Tk, Hk, Ek) (7) Based on its analysis, this function determines whether the current therapy Tk should be maintained due to sufficient progress, or if new, more suitable method should be selected by analyzing the observed outcomes and shortcomings. For instance, if the evaluation highlights lack of patient engagement with CBT techniques despite moderate efficacy score, the selection module might reason that shift to more client-centered approach is warranted. The initial therapy, T1, is determined from the patients intake profile. This adaptive mechanism is our key contribution to achieving long-term therapeutic effectiveness. It allows TheraMind to personalize the treatment arc, systematically abandoning ineffective strategies and reinforcing successful ones. This capability for strategic self-correction, guided by deliberative LLM-based judgment, is absent in current counseling agents and is crucial for moving towards truly autonomous therapeutic systems."

            "content": "Evaluating longitudinal counseling capabilities is notoriously difficult. Static, single-turn datasets are ill-suited for assessing skills like long-term memory, strategic adaptation, and therapeutic alliance building. To overcome this, we propose new evaluation paradigm grounded in dynamic, high-fidelity simulation. We construct our simulation environment using real, anonymized clinical cases from the CPsyCounR corpus (Zhang et al., 2024a). To ensure comprehensive and representative testbed, we sampled 100 cases, selecting 10 from each of the 10 distinct clinical categories present in the dataset, as detailed in Table 1. This stratified sampling approach ensures our agent is evaluated across wide spectrum of psychological issues. For each selected case, an initialization process, Φinit, generates structured Patient Profile (P) and series of high-level Session Guides (G = {g1, . . . , gK}) for six-session arc: (P, G) = Φinit(CaseCPsyCounR) (8) Category Description of Psychological Issues Emotional & Intimacy Problems (e.g., romantic, marital) Family & Parent-Child Relationship Issues Emotional Disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, OCD) Child & Adolescent Psychological/Behavioral Problems Interpersonal Relationships & Social Adaptation Stress & Stress-Related Disorders (e.g., academic, occupational) Addiction & Behavioral Control Issues (e.g., internet, gambling) Neurosis & Somatization Problems Love Family Emotion Youth Social Stress Addiction Anxiety Self-growth Personality & Personal Growth Issues (e.g., self-cognition) Rare Special Psychological Disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, autism) Table 1: Distribution of Patient Profile Categories Sampled from the CPsyCounR Corpus. These guides provide the LLM-based patient simulator with coherent goals for each session without rigidly scripting responses. This flexibility enables the simulated patient to exhibit dynamic emotional range, capable of expressing both positive and negative attitudes, thereby mirroring the variability of real-world patients. This semistructured approach creates controllable yet dynamic testbed that balances clinical realism with reproducibility, enabling robust evaluation of advanced, multi-session counseling skills."

This dataset provides robust foundation for evaluating the nuanced, long-term capabilities of counseling agents in realistic context. 4.2.2 Evaluation Metrics To provide comprehensive and clinically grounded assessment, our evaluation protocol draws upon established psychotherapy research and professional counseling standards (Hill, 1999; Ribeiro et al., 2013; Qiu and Lan, 2025; Zhang et al., 2024a). It is structured into single-session and multi-session metrics. Trained annotators rate all metrics on 4-point scale (0-3). Single-Session Metrics. We evaluate the quality of individual interactions along two primary dimensions: 1. Therapeutic Alliance (T.Alli): Based on the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) framework (Doran, 2016), this metric evaluates the agents ability to form collaborative partnership. It measures alignment on therapeutic Goals, collaborative execution of Tasks, and the establishment of an empathetic Bond. 2. Interaction Quality (Inter): This metric assesses the clinical depth of the dialogue, focusing on the agents capacity to integrate patient motivations, explore cognitive contradictions through strategic questioning, and facilitate patient self-awareness and reflection. Multi-Session Metrics. To evaluate longitudinal performance, we introduce four metrics that capture the agents effectiveness over the entire therapeutic arc: 1. Coherence (Coh): Measures the agents ability to maintain continuity across sessions by referencing and building upon past conversations to create cohesive therapeutic narrative. 2. Flexibility (Flex): Assesses the capacity to adapt therapeutic strategies over time, adjusting or integrating different methods in response to the patients evolving needs and progress. 3. Empathy (Emp): Evaluates the consistency of the agents empathetic engagement, including its ability to track emotional development, reframe negative expressions constructively, and utilize patient-generated metaphors as therapeutic tools.

For response generation, the agent is configured with temperature of 0.9, top-p = 0.75, and top-k = 20. In judgment tasks, we adopt lower temperature of 0.3 while keeping top-p and top-k unchanged, to encourage more deterministic and stable outputs. Unlike previous research that relies on predefined datasets, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) patient responses tend to be overly simplistic, failing to capture the diversity of realworld cases; (2) replies are fixed and lack crossturn consistency, we ground our evaluation in the CPsyCounR dataset (Zhang et al., 2024a). It follows standardized structure including Title, Type, Method, Case Brief, Consultation Process, and Experience Thoughts. To ensure representativeness, we uniformly sampled 100 cases across various patient categories and conducted evaluations over six-session dialogues. Based on these real cases, we employed large language model to simulate virtual patients capable of flexibly displaying both positive and negative attitudes, thereby building more realistic and diverse evaluation. For automatic evaluation, we used Gemini-2.5Flash, configured with temperature of 0, top-p = 0.95, and top-k = 64. The temperature is set to zero to guarantee deterministic outputs.

This highlights the effectiveness of the Intra-Session Loops mechanisms for maintaining long-term, clinically-grounded interactions. Crucially, its superior score in Flexibility (2.290) directly confirms the efficacy of the Cross-Session Loops adaptive therapy selection, capability largely absent in prior work. Furthermore, the comparison with its backbone model, DeepSeek-V3, is telling.

In contrast, TheraMinds ability to retrieve memories and adapt its therapy method allows it to effectively handle complex, evolving issues, showcasing its superior capability for true longitudinal counseling. 4.7 Human Evaluation To complement our automatic metrics and validate the nuanced clinical capabilities of our agent, we conducted two sets of human evaluations. Trained annotators with expertise in psychology performed all assessments. First, we assessed the internal validity of TheraMinds core components by evaluating the agreement between the agents decisions and human judgment. On sample of dialogues from 10 distinct cases, we achieved Cohens κ (Cohen, 1960) of 0.676, indicating substantial inter-annotator reliability, which falls within the range of substantial agreement (0.600.80). As shown in Figure 5 (Left), TheraMinds modules demonstrate high fidelity with human clinical reasoning. The Emotion Recognition (95.59% agreement) and Memory Invoke (94.12% agreement) modules are exceptionally accurate, confirming the robustness of the agents perceptual and contextualization capabilities. The Response Strategy selection also shows strong alignment (85.29%), validating its ability to make clinically sound tactical decisions. Second, we conducted pairwise comparative evaluation of TheraMind against three topperforming baselines: PsyDTLLM, DeepSeek-V3, and Interactive Agents. For this, we used simplified multi-session evaluation standard on 20 cases (two from each category), achieving Cohens κ of 0.697. The results, presented in Figure 5 (Middle), reveal clear human preference for TheraMind. It secured decisive win rates against the specialized counseling model PsyDTLLM (75%), its powerful backbone model DeepSeek-V3 (70%), and the advanced agent framework Interactive Agents (65%). This human-validated superiority, particularly over its own base model, provides compelling evidence that our novel dual-loop architecture is the key factor in achieving higher standard of longitudinal therapeutic care. 4.8 In-depth Analysis of TheraMinds Behavior To gain deeper insights into TheraMinds therapeutic process and internal decision-making, we conducted multi-faceted analysis of its behavFigure 3: Ablation Study.

Figure 3 presents the win rates of the full TheraMind model against these ablated versions. The results clearly show the necessity of all components, with the full model outperforming all ablated variants. Removing the Memory Mechanism causes the largest drop (75.00% win rate), underscoring the importance of maintaining longitudinal context to avoid clinical amnesia. Excluding Stage Adaptation (72.73%) highlights the need to align responses with therapeutic phases. Removing Response Strategy (68.42%) and Therapy Selection (66.67%) increases rigidity within and across sessions, confirming the value of adaptive, multi-granular control."

            "title": "4.6 Analysis Across Psychological Issues",
            "content": "To assess the robustness and generalizability of TheraMind, we conducted fine-grained performance analysis across the ten distinct categories of psychological issues. The results, as shown in Figure 4, reveal critical insights into the models capabilities in both single-turn and longitudinal contexts. In the single-session evaluation (left panel), TheraMind consistently achieves the highest scores across all domains. Moreover, the multi-session evaluation (right panel) paints much clearer picture of TheraMinds unique advantages. The performance gap between TheraMind and all other models widens dramatically. While most models show some improvement, their gains are inconsistent and marginal compared to TheraMind, which maintains consistently high level of performance across all ten categories. This demonstrates the profound impact of our dual-loop architecture. Lacking mechanism for cross-session memory and strategic adaptation, competing models fail to build coherent, long-term therapeutic narrative, causing their performance to plateau or degrade over 8 Figure 4: Performance comparison across ten distinct categories of psychological issues, evaluated in both single-session (left) and multi-session (right) contexts. The axes correspond to the categories detailed in Table 1. Figure 5: (Left) Human agreement analysis of TheraMinds internal decision-making modules. (Middle) Pairwise human preference evaluation. TheraMind was compared against three top-performing models on simplified multi-session evaluation standard. (Right) Distribution of patient emotions recognized by TheraMind during counseling sessions. ior during the simulated counseling sessions. This analysis examines the emotional landscape of the dialogues, the distribution of intervention strategies, the progression of therapeutic phases, and relationship between patient attitude and emotional intensity. As illustrated in Figure 5 (Right), the emotional landscape of the interactions is dominated by expected therapeutic emotions such as Fear (33.69%) and Sadness (24.56%). Crucially, Trust emerges as the third most prevalent emotion at 21.71%. This high proportion of Trust is strong indicator of the agents success in establishing robust therapeutic alliance, which is foundational prerequisite for effective psychological counseling and encourages deeper patient self-disclosure. An analysis of the agents intervention strategies, shown in Figure 6 (Left), reveals clinicallygrounded and diverse therapeutic repertoire. The most frequently used intervention is Reflection of Feelings (32.54%), underscoring the agents focus on building empathy. However, TheraMind does not rely solely on supportive responses. It actively guides the therapeutic process by employing change-oriented techniques such as Invite to Take New Perspectives (16.93%) and Invite to Explore New Actions (15.83%), demonstrating balanced approach that facilitates both emotional processing and cognitive-behavioral change. Furthermore, TheraMind successfully models the structured progression of longitudinal therapeutic arc. Figure 6 (Middle) shows clear and logical transition through distinct clinical phases across the six sessions. The initial sessions are heavily focused on Engagement, establishing rapport and understanding the patients context. The mid-stage of therapy shifts significantly towards Exploration, where the agent and patient work together to uncover deeper insights. Finally, the later sessions show marked increase in the Integration phase, where learnings are consolidated and plans for future action are made. This ability to guide the counseling process through coherent, multi-stage journey is key feature distinguishing TheraMind from static, single-session models. Finally, our framework demonstrates nuanced understanding of the patients psychological state by linking perceived attitude to emotional expression, as depicted in Figure 6 (Right). The analysis reveals that conversations with positive (coopera9 Figure 6: (Left) Frequency distribution of the different counseling intervention strategies employed by TheraMind.

This suggests that when patients feel safe and engaged, they are more willing to express their emotions fully. Conversely, negative (resistant) attitudes are associated with more varied and generally lower emotional intensity. Perceiving subtle attitudeemotion relations enables the agent to make more informed decisions for dynamic response strategy selection. immediate feelings (familiar weight, deep sadness) while seamlessly weaving in the retrieved memory to create continuity (...just as we did with the rib before?). This single turn demonstrates how TheraMind avoids clinical amnesia. By linking past breakthroughs to the present conversation, it transforms simple reactive reply into meaningful clinical intervention that reinforces the longitudinal therapeutic arc."

By counting the winning situation of TheraMind with better response quality in the twenty samples (including 120 sessions in total), we confirm that our TheraMind has demonstrated better counseling effects in various psychological counseling scenarios. In addition, to verify the reliability of our human evaluation in model comparison evaluation, we used Cohens κ coefficient to quantify the consistency of the evaluation results of multiple human evaluators. The final Cohens κ obtained was 0.697 (0.60.8), indicating that our human evaluation has high objectivity and impartiality, and the results of manual evaluation are generally reliable. each case was used for evaluation, covering total of 68 dialogue rounds. To ensure comprehensive assessment, the annotators were provided with both the target session and the previous sessions for contextual reference. As shown in Figure 5 (Left), TheraMinds modules demonstrate high fidelity with human clinical reasoning. The evaluation results show that the Emotion Recognition module reached an agreement rate of 95.59%, and the Memory Invoke module achieved 94.12%, demonstrating TheraMinds strong perceptual and contextual reasoning abilities. The Response Strategy module also obtained an agreement rate of 85.29%, indicating its capacity to make clinically coherent and contextually appropriate decisions. Inter-rater reliability, measured using Cohens κ was calculated as 0.67, which falls within the range typically interpreted as substantial agreement (0.600.80).

            "content": "To demonstrate TheraMinds advantages, we analyze the same session from single case and compare TheraMind (Figure 22) with three strong baselines, PsyTLLM (Figure 25), DeepSeeker-V3 (Figure 23), and Interactive Agents (Figure 24). PsyTLLM and DeepSeeker-V3 underattend to emotional signals, shift to techniques too early, and fail to help the patient trace emotions to their sources. Interactive Agents focuses narrowly on cognition, does not anchor or process current physical and somatic responses, and misses intervention windows. All three baselines underuse prior discussion, show memory inconsistency, and disrupt continuity. TheraMind better regulates pace and boundaries, flexibly adapts response strategies, and consistently centers the patients feelings, guiding the patient toward the causes of negative emotions. As complement to the main case study (Figure 7), we provide focused analysis. The complete six-session dialogue appears in Figures 26, 27, 28, and 29. Sessions 2 and 3 (Figure 27) illustrate TheraMinds decision process. In Session 2, the patient describes suffocating dream with giant rib, interpreted as overwhelming pressure. When the patient resists the initial intervention (Breathing? dont see how thatll help), TheraMind drops the exercise and invites the patient to name just one small piece of that ribs weight. The patient links the rib to my moms heavy expectations and reports feeling tiny bit lighter. TheraMind stores this metaphor across sessions. In Session 3, similar dream elicits worthlessness, the system detects sadness and negative stance, selects Reflection of Feelings strategy, and retrieves the rib metaphor. The response connects the present emotion (familiar weight of not feeling enough) with the prior insight (just as we did with the rib before), avoiding clinical amnesia and reinforcing the therapeutic arc. The patient then proposes victory journal to consolidate gains. Overall, these observations indicate that TheraMind delivers more coherent, empathic, and durable therapeutic progress than competing systems under comparable conditions."

When you think about your grandparents role in those bullying experiences, what feels most present for you right now?

Its scary to admit how much it still hurts, but want to understand this better. DOCTOR: Acknowledging and understanding the pain from your past is brave step. Swallowing anger can be coping mechanism but also source of hidden suffering. Lets explore how we can bring that anger to the surface and find way to heal it together. PATIENT: Okay...
