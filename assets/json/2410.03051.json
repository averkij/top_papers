            "content": "The task of video detailed captioning involves generating comprehensive and coherent textual descriptions of video content, capturing not only the primary actions and objects but also intricate details, contextual nuances, and temporal dynamics. It has emerged as critical area of research in computer vision and natural language processing, with significant implications for the fields of robotics (Yang et al., 2023b; Du et al., 2024), ego-centric perception (Grauman et al., 2022; 2023), embodied agents (Zhao et al., 2023; 2024c;d; Deng et al., 2023; 2024; Zhao et al., 2024b), and video editing (Chai et al., 2023) and generation (Bar-Tal et al., 2024). The challenges of video detailed captioning compared to past problems include the limited detailed caption data for training and evaluation, and also the lack of good evaluation metric. Before the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), previous models could only generate very short and rough descriptions of videos (Wang et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023a). Although these models have been trained on web-scale video-text datasets (e.g., HowTo100M (Miech et al., 2019) and VideoCC3M (Nagrani et al., 2022)), their capabilities remain limited due to their smaller scale and the lack of world knowledge possessed by LLMs. Recently, researchers start to build more powerful large multimodal models (LMMs) upon pretrained LLMs (e.g., LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024b), InstructBlip (Dai et al., 2024b), InternVL (Chen et al., 2023b)). These models typically use intermediate components (e.g., Q-Former (Li et al., 2023a) or an MLP) to connect the pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) and the LLM. Expanding from image-based LMMs to video-based LMMs is natural progression, as videos can be viewed as sequences of frames. While most LMMs start with loading the pre-trained weights from image models and are further fine-tuned with video-text data, we find that LLaVA-like models can be 1 Aurora Series: AuroraCap Table 1: Benchmark comparison for video captioning task.

However, naive treatment of videos as series of image frames can result in significant computational overhead and may cause generalization of the length problem (Wang et al., 2024b). To address these concerns, more specifically, to reduce the number of visual tokens, Video-LLaMA (Li et al., 2023f) adapts the video Q-former, MovieChat (Song et al., 2023) uses memory bank, LLaMA-VID (Li et al., 2023g) simply uses global pooling, and FastV (Chen et al., 2024b) drops visual tokens by attention rank within LLM layers. In this paper, we present AURORACAP, adapting simple yet efficient method called Token Merging (Bolya et al., 2022), which is proved to be effective in image and video classification and editing tasks (Li et al., 2023e). To be specific, we gradually combine similar tokens in transformer layer using bipartite soft matching algorithm to reduce the number of visual tokens. Following this pattern, our experiments show that we can use only 10% to 20% visual tokens compared to the original tokens generated by ViT with marginal performance drop in various benchmarks. With this technique, it is easier to support higher-resolution and longer video sequence inputs for training and inference. We present results on several widely used benchmarks, but find that existing video understanding benchmarks are either question-answer-based (Song et al., 2023; Chen & Dolan, 2011; Caba Heilbron et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024), which cannot demonstrate detailed descriptive abilities, or they provide descriptions that are too short, with only few words (Xu et al., 2016; Caba Heilbron et al., 2015) as shown in Table 1. Some large-scale datasets focus on specific domains such as ego-centric (Grauman et al., 2023) or contain low-quality videos and annotations (Bain et al., 2021). Therefore, we construct the VDC (Video Detailed Captions) benchmark, which contains over one thousand high-quality video-caption pairs spanning wide range of categories, and the resulting captions encompass rich world knowledge, object attributes, camera movements, and crucially, detailed and precise temporal descriptions of events. We utilize GPT-4o as our recaption assistant with hierarchical prompt design. To preserve as much information as possible from the videos and maintain temporal consistency, we implement dense-frame extraction strategy. Using the dense frames as input, despite description of the whole video, we also generate high-quality captions from different aspects, including objective facts, backgrounds, camera angles and movements. Manual quality inspection is employed to ensure the quality of the video captions. While existing video-caption datasets (Chen et al., 2024d; Ju et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b) offer structured captions, VDC is the first benchmark focused on detailed video captioning, providing significantly longer and more detailed captions than others as shown in the Table 1 and Section B. We also introduce novel evaluation metric specifically designed for detailed captioning task. Traditional metrics like METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005), CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015), and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), designed for machine translation or short captions, fail to evaluate detailed captions which contain rich semantic information. On the other side, an LLM-based evaluation metric is commonly used in visual question answering benchmarks (Maaz et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024), especially for those generated by VLMs (Song et al., 2024; 2023). However, we observe that the LLM-based evaluation metric still struggles to differentiate the quality of detailed captions and tends to give lower scores. To address these challenges, we propose VDCSCORE, novel captioning evaluation metric that leverages the reliability of large language models (LLMs) by Aurora Series: AuroraCap evaluating short visual question-answer pairs. We first decompose the ground-truth caption into set of concise question-answer pairs using the LLM, then generate corresponding responses from the predicted caption. Finally, the LLM is used to assess the accuracy of each response to provide an overall score. In particular, our paper makes the following contributions: In Section 2, we illustrate how we can reduce the number of tokens used for image or video input before injecting into LLM with marginal performance drop. Using these insights, we propose AURORACAP, which is shown to be the state-of-the-art video captioning model. In Section 3, we present VDC, the first benchmark for detailed video captioning, featuring over one thousand videos with significantly longer and more detailed captions. We comprehensively evaluate proprietary and open-source models using our proposed VDCSCORE metric."

            "content": "Large multimodal model. To effectively leverage the capabilities of both the pre-trained LLM and visual model, which is typically CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) or DINO (Oquab et al., 2023), LLaVA adapt simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as projection layer to connect each patch tokens of image features into the word embedding space. The original LLaVA model is trained by two-stage instruction-tuning procedure, which first pretraining projection layer for feature alignment and then finetuning end-to-end while freeze the visual encoder. Recent works like Prismatic VLMs (Karamcheti et al., 2024) and Idefics2 (Laurencon et al., 2024) further explore the design space of LLaVA architecture. We adapt some conclusion from those works for training the model. Token merging. To increase the throughput of existing ViT models, Token Merging (Bolya et al., 2022) is proposed to gradually combines similar tokens in transformer to reduce the number of tokens passing through ViT models. Token Merging has been proven to be effective on image and video classification tasks even without the need for training. Token Merging is applied between the attention and MLP within each transformer block as: 1. Alternatively partition the tokens into two sets and of roughly equal size. 2. For each token in set A, calculate the token similarity with each token in set based on cosine similarity of the Key features in attention block. 3. Use bipartite soft matching and then select the most similar pairs. 4. Merge the tokens using weighted average, record the token size. 5. Concatenate the two sets and back together again. Once the tokens have been merged, they actually carry the features for more than one input patch. Therefore, the merged tokens will have less effect in softmax attention as = softmax (cid:18) QK (cid:19) + log (1) where is the number of patches the token represents after token merging. We conduct frame-wise token merging in AURORACAP, the visualization of token merging can be found in Appendix C. 2.2 TRAINING RECIPE Building upon the exploration in works like Prismatic VLMs (Karamcheti et al., 2024), Idefics2 (Laurencon et al., 2024), and InternVL (Chen et al., 2023b), we further adopt threestage training strategy, which can be noted as Pretraining stage, Vision stage and Language stage. The training data used in each stage are shown in Table E3, Table E4 and Table E5. More training details including hyper-parameters selection and data preprocessing operation can be found in Appendix E. Pretraining stage. Similar to LLaVA, we first align visual features from the vision encoder ViT with the word embedding space of LLMs. To achieve this, we freeze the pretrained ViT and LLM, training solely the vision-language connector. Consistent with LLaVA-1.5 (Li et al., 2024a), we employ two-layer MLP as the projection layer and pretrain on 1.3M image-caption pairs. To optimize performance, we explore various combinations of the pre-trained ViT and LLM in Appendix D. 3 Aurora Series: AuroraCap Table 2: Comparison of AURORACAP with LLM-based SoTA methods on image captioning benchmarks under zero-shot setting.

Vision stage. Unlike LLaVA, we next unfreeze the pretrained ViT while freezing the LLM during vision stage and train with the public data among various computer vision tasks (e.g., captioning, object identification, classification, reasoning, VQA, and etc.) to get better generalization (Huh et al., 2024). The motivation for doing this is that CLIP ViT usually performs poorly in aspects such as Orientation and Direction, Positional and Relational Context, Quantity and Count (Tong et al., 2024b). However, since the most of the collected datasets lack high-quality and detailed corresponding language descriptions, the labels often consist of only few words or short phrase when converted to text. Therefore, unfreezing the language model at this stage is risky, as it may lead to degradation in the performance of the language model. Language stage. Finally, we conduct end-to-end training, which means all the components are trainable, with the most high-quality public data during language stage training. We mix all the data, including images and videos, captions and instructions, into each mini-batch for training. To improve video captioning performance, we duplicate the video captioning datasets twice. We remove all the video training data for training image-based AURORACAP as well for image captioning task. 2.3 EVALUATION In this section we evaluate AURORACAP on various tasks including image captioning, video captioning, and video question answering. Appendix show detailed evaluation settings. Image Captioning. We evaluate AURORACAP using CIDEr (C), BELU-4 (B@4), BELU-1 (B@1), METEOR (M), and ROUGE-L (R) metric on Flickr (Plummer et al., 2015), NoCaps (Agrawal et al., 2019), and COCO-Cap (Lin et al., 2014) benchmarks and compare it with LLM-based state-of-the-art methods as shown in Table 2. We show the performance of image based AURORACAP under zero-shot settings. Notice that these benchmarks all contain short captions consisting of single sentence, so they only partially reflect the models performance. The performance mentioned in the rest of this paper refers to video-based AURORACAP. Video Captioning. Although the current video captioning benchmarks are only contains onesentence captions, to compare with prior work, we similarly evaluate on these benchmarks. We evaluate AURORACAP using CIDer (C), BELU-4 (B@4), BELU-1 (B@1), METEOR (M), and ROUGE-L (R) metric on MSR-VTT (Xu et al., 2016), VATEX (Wang et al., 2019) and compare it with other methods as shown in Table 3. Video Question Answering. We evaluate AURORACAP on MSVD-QA (Xu et al., 2017), ActivityNet-QA (Yu et al., 2019), MSRVTT-QA (Xu et al., 2017), and iVQA (Yang et al., 2021) for video question answering tasks as shown in Table 4. Although AURORACAP is primarily captioning model, it achieves competitive performance in some VQA datasets (ANet, iVQA). For others (MSVD, MSR-VTT) performance is more modest, but still not bad. In some failure cases observed in the model, we found that prompting the model to generate comprehensive caption for the video input can lead to outputs that include the correct answer. This phenomenon may be attributed to disruption in the models instruction-following capabilities during the visual-based training period. We regard this as promising avenue for future research. 4 Aurora Series: AuroraCap Table 3: Comparison of AURORACAP with SoTA methods on existing video captioning benchmarks under zero-shot setting.

            "content": "3.1 BENCHMARK DATASET CURATION 3.1.1 VIDEO COLLECTION AND PROCESSING To ensure the reliability of the benchmark, it is crucial to maintain high video quality, balanced data distribution, and content complexity. Panda-70M (Chen et al., 2024e) offers high-resolution, opendomain YouTube video dataset with diverse one-minute clips across wildlife, cooking, sports, news, TV shows, gaming, and 3D rendering, ideal for studying complex real-world scenarios. Additionally, large volume of aesthetically appealing videos from user-uploaded platforms like Mixkit (Mixkit, 2024), Pixabay (Pixabay, 2024), and Pexels (Pexels, 2024) provides scenic views and visually pleasing human activities with minimal transitions and simpler events. Ego4D (Grauman et al., 2022) complements the video source by focusing on ego-centric human activities and auto-driving scenarios, ensuring comprehensive coverage of real-world scenes. To mitigate content homogeneity among these candidate videos and maintain diversity in the final dataset, inspired by ShareGPT4Video (Chen et al., 2024d), we building VDC upon those various video sources. Note that the videos used in VDC construction are not included in the training data of AURORACAP. To ensure balanced data distribution, we allocate equal proportions of videos from Panda-70M (Chen et al., 2024e), Ego4D (Grauman et al., 2022), Mixkit (Mixkit, 2024), Pixabay (Pixabay, 2024), and Pexels (Pexels, 2024). We first split the video into clips and apply dense frame extraction. 3.1.2 STRUCTURED DETAILED CAPTIONS CONSTRUCTION PIPELINE We believe that comprehensive detailed video caption benchmark should encompass various aspects, including main objects, camera movements, and background. However, most existing benchmarks (Li et al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2024d) provide only single caption for the entire video with less structured Aurora Series: AuroraCap Table 5: The video source distribution of the proposed VDC benchamrk including diverse settings such as natural landscapes, human activities, and animal activities. Videos from different sources have similar proportion in VDC, reducing the data bias. Video Source # Sample Proportion Duration (sec.) Ave. Length (sec.)

Figure 2: Distribution of structured caption length. details. Therefore, we develop structured detailed captions construction pipeline to generate extra detailed descriptions from various perspectives, significantly extending the length and enhancing the richness compared to previous benchmarks. Following (Ju et al., 2024), the structured captions in VDC encompass not only short and detailed captions but also three additional categories: (1) main object caption, offering comprehensive analysis of the primary subjects actions, attributes, interactions, and movements across frames, including variations in posture, expression, and speed; (2) background caption, providing detailed descriptions of the background, such as objects, location, weather, time, and dynamic elements; and (3) camera caption, which details the camera work, including shot types, angles, movements, transitions, and special effects. To generate detailed, fine-grained, and accurate captions, we leverage GPT-4o to produce video descriptions. We utilize the dense video frames to obtain captions. We observed that generating all captions in single conversation round often introduces hallucinations in the detailed captions. To address this, we design hierarchical prompt strategy to efficiently obtain accurate structured captions and detailed captions in two conversation rounds: (1) structured captions generation and (2) detailed captions integration. In the first round, the prompt briefly introduces the differences between structured captions and uses the dense video frames as input to generate the short caption, main object caption, background caption, camera caption, and the detailed caption. In the second round, the generated captions serve as the reference. The second-round prompt guides GPT-4o to enhance the detailed caption based on the initial captions, ensuring consistency without introducing new entities or relations, and producing vivid, engaging, and informative description. The whole prompt template for the structured detailed captions construction pipeline can be found in Appendix H. Finally, we conduct manual review to correct captions with hallucinations and supplement omitted visual elements. The refined detail structured captions are then used as the ground truth for evaluation. 3.1.3 COMPARISON ON NUMERICAL STATISTICS Based on the hierarchical scheme, VDC can capture rich variety of details of the video and reduce hallucinations. The visual representation in Figure 1 demonstrates the video duration distribution of VDC. Over 87% of the videos exhibit duration ranging from 10K to 12K frames, while 1% of videos extending beyond 60 seconds. Only 13% of videos have duration less than 10 seconds. As illustrated in Table 1, the average length of detailed descriptions in VDC is significantly longer than in previous benchmarks. Figure 2 shows the length distribution of structured captions in VDC, with detailed captions averaging over 500 words. Appendix present more statistics. Aurora Series: AuroraCap Figure 3: Evaluation pipeline with VDCSCORE. Like when humans take reading comprehension tests, we transform the matching between two paragraphs into set of question-answer pairings. We first generate some question-answer pairs based on the ground truth captions, then derive corresponding answers one by one from the generated captions, and finally perform matching. The process is automatically evaluated with the LLM involvement in each step. 3.2 EVALUATION METRIC DESIGN AND LEADERBOARD 3.2.1 VDCSCORE: EVALUATING DETAILED CAPTIONS WITH LLMS Evaluating video captions requires not only assessing the quality of the captions but also flexibly evaluating the alignment between the video and the caption. While metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015), and ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) have been employed for caption evaluation, these metrics are predominantly designed for short captions and rely heavily on word-level frequency-based alignment. Given the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs), Video-ChatGPT (Li et al., 2023b) proposes using LLM as an evaluation assistant to directly judge the correctness of the whole predicted captions and assign scores. However, as demonstrated in Table 6, our experiments indicate that when dealing with detailed captions, the direct application of LLM struggles to accurately distinguish the correctness of various predicted captions, fails to effectively evaluate the precision of detailed descriptions, and exhibits tendency to assign disproportionately lower scores. Therefore, we introduce VDCSCORE, novel quantitative metric that utilizes LLMs to evaluate the similarity between predicted and ground-truth detailed captions through divide-and-conquer approach. The core idea of VDCSCORE is to decompose long detailed captions into multiple short questionanswering pairs, avergae the evaluation of each pair as the final result. We elaborate the design of VDCSCORE in the following parts: (1) ground-truth question-answer pairs extraction, (2) responsed answers generation and (3) answers matching. As illustrated in Figure 3, we first employ GPT-4o to generate question-answer pairs from the detailed ground-truth caption. To ensure that the generated question-answer pairs capture as much information as possible from the original caption and facilitate accurate evaluation by LLMs, we constrain the number of generated pairs and impose specific guidelines: the questions must be open-ended, and the answers should be concise, and directly relevant to the questions. For fair comparison and to mitigate potential variability arising from generating different question-answer pairs for the same caption, we pre-generate standardized set of question-answer pairs for all captions in VDC, as depicted in Figure 3. The used prompt templates used along with additional examples, are provided in Appendix I. VDCSCORE subsequently analyzes the predicted captions by leveraging ground-truth questionanswer pairs. We prompt GPT-4o to read the detailed predicted captions and generate answers based solely on these captions. To mitigate biases arising from discrepancies in the length between ground-truth and predicted answers, we also impose constraints ensuring that responses are limited to concise sentences or phrases. Consequently, for each pair of ground-truth and predicted captions, we obtain set of <question, correct answer, predicted answer> triplets. Following Video-ChatGPT (Li et al., 2023b), we then ask GPT-4o to output two scores for each triplet: one 7 Aurora Series: AuroraCap Figure 4: Comparison between various models with different number of visual tokens input on VDC. For Gemini-1.5-Pro, we only report the performance. We manage the number of visual tokens by managing token merging for AURORACAP, and manage the number of frames for others. AURORACAP achieves much better VDCSCORE than all other models given certain compression in the number of visual tokens kept and indeed approaches the performance of Gemini-1.5-Pro. Table 6: Comparison of AURORACAP with LLM-based baseline methods on VDCSCORE and other evaluation metrics under zero-shot setting. For each evaluation metric, we report the average value of the five structured captions in VDC. Note that VDD, CIDEr, and BELU are only the average of background and main object caption, since the values of the others are closed to zero.

When using two same captions as input, VDCSCORE returns an accuracy of 100%, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability. 3.2.2 BENCHMARKING VIDEO DETAILED CAPTIONING To our knowledge, no standard evaluation benchmarks have been established for detailed video captioning. To advance this field, we assess several baselines on our proposed VDC. As illustrated in Table 6, we present quantitative comparison between our AURORACAP with existing stateof-the-art LMMs. We compare the VDCSCORE with both rule-based and model-based caption metrics with AURORACAP performing well. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) and METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005) are included as representative 8 Aurora Series: AuroraCap Table 7: Comparison of AURORACAP with LLM-based baseline methods on VDCSCORE under zeroshot structured captions setting. We consider the VDCSCORE of detailed captions, short captions, background captions, main object captions and camera captions.

For model-based metrics, we also consider Video Detailed Description (Li et al., 2023b) (VDD), which employs ChatGPT as an evaluation assistant to compare full captions. Table 7 presents VDCSCORE performance across various sections of structured captions within VDC. Following (Chen et al., 2024c), we also incorporate vision-blind baselines. Furthermore, Figure 4 illustrates schematic diagram of the performance and efficiency of different video training models. Since the comparison of model inference time under different architectures, models, deployment frameworks, and output lengths is unfair, so we used the number of visual tokens as representation of efficiency. AURORACAP achieves superior performance in video detailed captioning while utilizing significantly fewer visual tokens than other models, fully highlighting the efficiency of AURORACAP. We also show additional experimental results with VDD metric as shown in Table 8. We also perform human study using Elo ranking to supplement our evaluation and provide more intuitive assessment of AURORACAPs performance. As depicted in Figure 5, VDCSCORE shows the better correlation with human evaluation results than VDD and ROUGE metric. Ablation study on token merging ratio.

We define the performance percentage as the proportion between the highest and lowest values on the entire performance curve. As shown in Figure 6, most models maintain satisfactory performance (> 80%) even with only 0.2 of visual token kept ratio. Since AURORACAP focuses on spatial visual token merging, the temporal features introduce additional complexity to explore the token merging laws, resulting in the optimal performance may occurs at middle level of visual token kept ratio."

By leveraging the token merging strategy, we significantly reduce the computational overhead without compromising performance. We also present VDC, novel video detailed captioning benchmark designed to evaluate comprehensive and coherent textual descriptions of video content. For better evaluating, We propose VDCSCORE , new LLM-assisted metric with divideand-conquer strategy. Our extensive evaluation on various video and image captioning benchmarks demonstrated that AURORACAP achieves competitive results, even outperforming state-of-the-art models in some tasks. We also conduct thorough ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of token merging and other aspects of our model. We found that the current model performs poorly in terms of the trade-off between performance and the scale of input tokens. Additionally, there is still room for improvement in camera handling and detailed captioning. We hope that VDC can bring new insights to the video detailed captioning task. 10 Aurora Series: AuroraCap"

            "title": "A RELATED WORKS",
            "content": "Video Captioning The general goal of video captioning is understanding video and describing it with natural language. Unlike image captioning, video captioning requires the description also on the temporal dimension (e.g., human action, camera and object movement). The current datasets including videos in the domain of human activities (Caba Heilbron et al., 2015), cooking scene (Zhou et al., 2018; Iashin & Rahtu, 2020), movie (Song et al., 2023), and open domain (Chen & Dolan, 2011). In Table 1, we show the summary of current video captioning benchmarks. Most of them are with short caption, which is not suitable for evaluating video detailed captioning task. There are several widely used metrics to evaluate the correctness of generated caption, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015), SPICE (Anderson et al., 2016), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019). Dense Video Captioning (Yang et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2024) is also captioning task but further requires localizing the events temporally. In this paper, we focus on the detailed description of short video clip, where there are no scene changes or camera switches. Large Multimodal Models for Video With the develop of LLMs and LMMs (Maaz et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023f; Song et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Song et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2024; team, 2024; Jin et al., 2024; Beyer et al., 2024; Shang et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c), many recent works have explored adapting them into video understanding field (e.g., Video-LLaMA (Li et al., 2023f), Video-LLaVA (Lin et al., 2023a), VideoChat (Li et al., 2023b), Vista-LLaMA (Ma et al., 2023), LLaVA-Hound (Zhang et al., 2024c), Koala (Tan et al., 2024), Elysium (Wang et al., 2024a), and MovieChat (Song et al., 2023; 2024)). Thanks to this flexible design, the models can combine pretrained knowledge with minimal trainable parameters. Instead of requiring large-scale training, using only small amount of high-quality training data can even achieve better results. Most of the existing models use additional parameters for temporal modeling. There are also some interesting observations that we can actually build advancing LMMs without additional parameters for temporal modeling (Xu et al., 2024a; Lin et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024a; Ren et al., 2023) or even without further training with video-text data (Wu, 2024). Recent works (e.g., FreeVA (Wu, 2024), LLaVA-Next (Liu et al., 2024a), VLIA (Lin et al., 2023b), and PLLaVA (Xu et al., 2024a)) also find that the vanilla LLaVA-like model pretrained on high-quality image instruction data can also be strong video understanding model. FreeVA further observe that using existing video instruction tuning data like Video-ChatGPT 100K (Maaz et al., 2023) to tune LMMs may not necessarily lead to improvements. As the concurrent work, we also observe this phenomenon and proceeded to develop video detailed captioning baseline training based on the LLaVA architecture. As for the benchmark , inspired by LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024b), Video-ChatGPT (Maaz et al., 2023) introduces 100K video clips with text instructions with the first vLMMs benchmark evaluation system powered by LLMs. MovieChat-1K (Song et al., 2023) and CinePile (Rawal et al., 2024) 23 Aurora Series: AuroraCap are question-answering based benchmark for long-form video understanding. Shot2Story20K (Han et al., 2023) comprises videos with 2 to 8 shots each sourced for our dataset from the public video benchmark HDvila100M (Xue et al., 2022). However, currently there is no video benchmark available to evaluate video detailed captioning tasks like IIW (Garg et al., 2024) did in image captioning field. In this paper, our work fills this gap."

This organic imagery quickly transitions, revealing that the mossy surface is actually part of motorcycle or vehicles engine compartment, creating striking contrast between the lush textures of nature and the cold, hard lines of mechanical components. As the camera angle shifts, the viewer is drawn deeper into the engine compartment, where the interplay of moss overgrowth on various machinery introduces fascinating blend of organic life and industrial elements, highlighting the unexpected coexistence of nature and technology. The perspective then zooms in, accentuating the rich details of the mossy growth, which clings tenaciously to the metallic surfaces, while dark cavity beneath hints at the complexity of the machinery. The reflective metallic surfaces glint in the light, further enhancing the visual contrast and inviting the viewer to explore this unique juxtaposition. Suddenly, the scene shifts dramatically, with rapid camera motion creating vibrant blur of colors and shapes, transforming the previously detailed views into chaotic whirlwind, suggesting swift movement through the intricate landscape of the engine compartment. As the motion blur begins to dissipate, the viewer is presented with clearer image of lightcolored, textured surface, where blurred mechanical components can be discerned, indicating deceleration in movement. The camera stabilizes, revealing rough-textured floor or ground that suggests an indoor or industrial environment, characterized by sense of organized chaos. The scene transitions to detailed examination of cluttered workspace filled with tangled wires, casings, and components in variety of colors, emphasizing the disorganized state of electronic or mechanical internals, possibly during maintenance or repair process. 24 Aurora Series: AuroraCap The perspective shifts once more, showcasing darker, textured surfaces juxtaposed against lighter insulating materials, with hidden metallic elements peeking through, suggesting another angle within this same cluttered interior space. human hand enters the frame, reaching out to interact with the components, signaling an active workspace filled with purpose. As the scene expands, additional hands join the fray, actively manipulating various objects within the crowded environment, signifying an ongoing task or collaborative effort amidst the complex array of components and materials. The atmosphere is imbued with sense of urgency and engagement, as the camera captures the dynamic interactions of the individuals working together. The camera work remains fluid and dynamic, featuring mix of close-up shots that highlight the intricate details of the components and wider angles that provide context to the bustling environment. The slightly shaky nature of the shots adds layer of realism and immersion, drawing the viewer into the heart of the action. The low light conditions create moody ambiance, with shadows dancing across the surfaces, enhancing the visual depth and interest of the scene. Overall, the video encapsulates vivid portrayal of the intersection between nature and machinery, as well as the collaborative spirit of those engaged in the intricate task of maintenance and repair within this unique setting."

            "title": "D ABLATION STUDIES",
            "content": "In this section, we conduct the ablation studies in several aspects including token merging, slowfast inference, efficiency, training strategy, and backbone selection. Token merging. As core strategy of AURORACAP, token merging plays significant role in reducing the number of visual tokens. We conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of the token kept ratio Rvtk in terms of performance across multiple tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, video captioning, and video question answering as shown in Figure D7 and Figure D8. We define the performance percentage as the proportion between the highest and lowest values on the entire performance curve. We identify the minimum retention thresholds for achieving 90% and 80% performance. As shown in Figure D7, while the performance of AURORACAP generally declines with fewer visual tokens across most benchmarks, it remains relatively stable at higher retention levels. Most models maintain satisfactory performance (> 80%) even with only 0.4 of Rvtk, highlighting the efficiency of our approach. Visual token retention thresholds vary by task complexity, with more visually demanding tasks needing higher retention of visual tokens. For instance, CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015) on COCO-Cap (Veit et al., 2016) maintains over 90% performance with an Rvtk of 0.3, whereas accuracy on GQA (Hudson & Manning, 2019) drops to 90% when the Rvtk is reduced to 0.8. Unlike image understanding, the optimal performance across most video understanding benchmarks occurs at relatively low Rvtk as depicted in Figure D8. And for MSR-VTT (Xu et al., 2016), VATEX (Wang et al., 2019), and ActivityNet-QA (Yu et al., 2019), even achieve better results at extremely low Rvtk (< 0.1). It indicates that comparing to image, video input have higher redundancy. Note that AURORACAP focuses on spatial visual token merging, while the temporal features introduce additional complexity to explore the token merging laws. Appendix shows more calculation details and the visualization results of token merging. Slowfast inference. Inspired by Slowfast-LLaVA (Xu et al., 2024b), we explore whether combining frames with low and high Rvtk can enhance performance. In practice, we dont conduct token merging in the first frame and concatenate them with the merged tokens from subsequent frames. We apply this strategy to both video captioning and video question answering tasks, comparing performance with and without the inclusion of full first-frame visual tokens. As illustrated in Table D1, slowfast inference brings marginal performance improvement in video question answering tasks or even drop in video captioning tasks but with more computing cost. Therefore, by default, we dont using slowfast inference for video detailed captioning. We also present the performance curve with and without the inclusion of full first-frame visual tokens as the visual token kept ratio varies during inference across multiple video understanding tasks. As illustrated in Figure D9 and Figure D10, despite the inclusion of full first-frame visual tokens, slowfast inference does not consistently result in significantly positive effects on performance. In some cases, the incorporation of full first-frame visual tokens even worsens performance degradation as the kept ratio decreases, particularly in video captioning tasks. Efficiency. To assess the inference speed, we utilize the inference time per video question-answering pair in seconds (TPV) as an evaluative metric. SGLang is an accelerated serving framework for LLMs and multimodal LLMs. We consider four settings including with or without token merging and SGLang. Figure D5 indicates the minimum TPV achievable in each settings across seven video understanding datasets. Reducing the visual tokens and using SGLang result in excellent inference times per video question-answering pair while all the datasets with short video and question inputs.

For each input, we process the video at resolution of 378 378 and sample 8 frames using single H100 GPU. Training strategy. Alternative training strategies for the language stage of AURORACAP are less frequently explored, which is the primary focus of this section. For fair comparison, we use the same training datasets across all settings and maintain consistent hyper-parameters. The following training settings are explored: Setting A: End-to-end training and set Rvtk to 1.0. Setting B: Following Slowfast-LLaVA (Xu et al., 2024b), we retain full visual tokens in the first frame and concatenate with merged tokens using Rvtk of 0.1. Setting C: End-to-end training and set Rvtk to 0.1. Setting D: Most videos in the training data have no more than 8 key frames, while subset (mainly from ShareGPT4Video (Chen et al., 2024d)) contains significantly more. We first exclude this subset from end-to-end training and then use it to train solely the LLM, enhancing its ability to handle multi-frame inputs. Setting E: Training solely the LLM match the performance of Setting set Rvtk at 0.1. We implement these training strategies, track training costs in H100 hours, and evaluate across various video understanding tasks. As shown in Figure D6, while training with an Rvtk of 1.0 improves performance, it significantly increases training time. Surprisingly, mixing lower and higher visual token ratios during training offers no significant advantage. Training only the LLM under the two settings results in performance drop, indicating that enhancing long video understanding still requires collaboration with the finetuning the visual encoder. Therefore, we choose Setting as the final training strategy. Backbone selection. We use the the training loss among the last ten iterations in original LLaVA alignment pretraining stage to guidance the ViT and LLM backbones selection as shown in Table D2. 28 Aurora Series: AuroraCap Figure D6: Comparison between different training strategy in Language stage.

Figure M15: Video example of MSR-VTT (Xu et al., 2016) benchmark. Figure M16: Video example of VATEX (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark. Figure M17: Video example. 39 Aurora Series: AuroraCap Figure M18: Video example. Figure M19: Video example. Figure M20: Video example. Figure M21: Video example. Figure M22: Video example. Example Caption Figure M15 [short caption] man with mustache and woman with ponytail are sitting at table. Figure M16 [short caption] man plays the drums in recording studio. Figure M17 [detailed caption] The video depicts serene beach scene where young woman stands on the sandy shore, gazing out towards the ocean. She is wearing black beanie and pink jacket, adding pop of color to the otherwise muted scene. The beach, vast expanse of sand, stretches out in front of her, meeting the ocean at the horizon. The ocean, vast body of water, is visible in the background. The beach is bathed in soft, diffused light, creating dreamy atmosphere. The girls gaze is directed towards the horizon, suggesting sense of wonder or contemplation. The image is slightly blurred, adding dreamy quality to the scene. The womans position on the beach, coupled with the gentle waves of the ocean, suggests moment of contemplation or admiration. The relative positions of the objects suggest peaceful day at the beach, with the girl possibly enjoying the serene view of the ocean. The colors are mostly muted, with the girls pink jacket standing out against the sandy beach and the blue ocean. The blurred background and the out-of-focus elements, such as the ocean and the sky, contribute to the sense of tranquility and focus on the woman. There is no text present in the video, and the colors are muted, with the exception of the pink jacket, which stands out against the more subdued tones of the surroundings. 40 Aurora Series: AuroraCap Figure M18 [detailed caption] The video features man with beard and long hair, lying on the ground with his head resting on tree trunk. He is wearing colorful shirt with mix of orange and green patterns. The mans face is partially obscured by the tree trunk, but his eyes are visible, looking upwards. He appears to be smiling or laughing, with his mouth open. The mans arms are crossed over his chest, suggesting relaxed or playful posture. The background is blurred, but it appears to be natural outdoor setting, possibly forest or park. In the background, another person is partially visible, their presence subtly hinted at by hand reaching out from the left side of the frame. The colors in the video are warm, with the mans shirt standing out against the muted background. The mans hair and beard are dark, and he has light complexion. The overall mood of the video is lighthearted and carefree. There are no visible texts or other objects in the video, and the relative positions of the objects remain constant with the man in the foreground and the second person in the background. Figure M19 [background caption] The background features race track with visible tire marks and barriers, surrounded by grassy areas and few scattered trees. The track is set in rural or semi-rural location, with hills in the distance and cloudy sky overhead, suggesting overcast weather conditions. The track itself appears well-maintained with smooth surface, designed for highspeed racing. The weather, indicated by the cloudy sky, contributes to the overall ambiance of the scene, enhancing the sense of cool, possibly early morning or late afternoon setting. Figure M20 [camera caption] The camera maintains steady, frontal view throughout the video, capturing the womans expressions and the intricate details of the bookshelves. The camera starts at the right edge of the bookshelf, moving across the shelf, and ends at the left edge of the bookshelf. The framing is consistent, focusing on the woman and the bookshelves, with the camera positioned at medium distance to the subject. This movement provides comprehensive view of the bookshelf, showcasing the variety of books and their arrangement on the shelves. The camera occasionally pans to reveal the depth of the library, showcasing the rows of books and the inviting atmosphere. The use of natural light enhances the visual appeal, creating warm and inviting tone throughout the video. Figure M21 [camera caption] The view shot remains relatively static, focusing on the children playing in the backyard. The camera angle is at eye level, capturing the scene from distance that allows both children to be visible. There is minimal camera movement, maintaining steady focus on the children and their activities. The sequence of video frames suggests continuous moment of play without significant changes in shooting angles or camera movement. Figure M22 [main object caption] The main subject in the video, black car, is seen driving down street that appears to be in state of disarray. The car moves steadily forward, navigating around obstacles such as blue car parked on the side of the road. The cars movement is smooth and continuous, suggesting it is either in motion or has just come to stop. The environment around the car is chaotic, with debris scattered across the road and signs of destruction, indicating recent event or disaster. The cars position remains central in the frame, with the camera angle focused on it from slightly elevated perspective, possibly from vehicle or structure above."
